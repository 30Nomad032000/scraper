	This case concerns three children.  They are A who was born in 2010, B who was born in 2011 and C who was born in 2013.  The parents are the first and second respondents (M and F).

 
	This hearing is the Issue Resolutions Hearing (IRH).  There was due to be a final hearing starting on 10th February 2014.  The time estimate was 7 days.  That hearing had been arranged to determine the LA's original application which had been for the permanent removal of the children from the parents' care.

 
	By the time of today's hearing the position had changed.  The LA's care plans were for the children to remain in the care of the parents subject to a supervision order and a contract of expectations.  All parties except for the guardian agreed.  The guardian in a careful and detailed report set out her reservations about the plan.  It is a powerful report.  It recommended that unless the parents showed a greater commitment to co-operating with the LA and the contract of expectations was more robust, the elder children should live with the paternal grandparents while the youngest remained with the parents subject to a supervision order.  

 
	The grandparents had been approved as potential Special Guardians for the elder children.  The paternal uncle and his wife had been approved as potential Special Guardians for the youngest child.

 
	Following discussions at court today and the inclusion of certain amendments to the contract of expectations, it was agreed that the children should all remain with the parents subject to supervision orders.   

 
	The agreed threshold criteria contain a number of worrying matters.  The children at the relevant dates (28th February 2013 and 27th August 2013) were living in a cramped, dirty and untidy home.  The mother suffered from mental health difficulties.  Both parents misused drugs.  The elder children were not being properly fed and suffered from iron deficiency.  They had delayed speech and general development.   The children all missed health and other important appointments.  The parents were resistant to advice and help from the LA and other agencies.

 
	Since December 2013, however, the situation has improved.  There has continued to be a commendably high level of input from the LA which has liaised with the other agencies.  The parents have shown that they have an improved understanding and acceptance of what went wrong with the earlier care of their children.  They have today signed a significantly tightened contract of expectations.  It is to their credit that the parents have brought themselves to their present position.  That could not have been achieved without the commitment of the LA's workers and the guardian's input. 

 
	The guardian continues to have concerns on behalf of the children about the position in the family home.  She has, however, come to the view that given the proper implementation of the contract the parenting of the children will be "good enough".

 
	Today's arrangements include provision for the paternal grandparents to have contact with the children and to undertake a significant supporting role. 

 
	I am very pleased that it has been possible for the court to approve the agreed arrangements and to make supervision orders.

HER HONOUR JUDGE BROWN:

I am about to give an ex tempore judgment in this matter, having heard submissions from the parties and evidence from the mother.  I hope in the circumstances I will be forgiven for the brevity of this judgment, which perhaps does not reflect the importance of the judgment, in particular to the two children involved and to the mother.

 

I have been greatly assisted throughout this hearing by Mr Allen on behalf of the local authority, Buckinghamshire County Council, by Miss Grieve on behalf of the mother, Miss S, and by Mr Wainman on behalf of both children through the children's guardian, Mr Slade.

 

Mother is in court and has an interpreter.  I am informed that she can understand both Cantonese and Mandarin.  

 

The proceedings before me today are in respect of two children, "H", born on 12 August 2009, rising five in August, and "R", born on 13 September 2012.  He will be four in September.  The mother is Miss S.  She is in court, represented and assisted by an interpreter.  The father is Mr H.  He is not present and has played no part in these proceedings.  

 

There are two applications before the court.  The first is by prospective adopters for the two boys, who I shall refer to as "Mr and Mrs X".  The application for an adoption order is supported by the local authority and the children's guardian.  The mother sought permission to oppose the adoption order but she did not receive permission to oppose and therefore she does not have the legal right to oppose the making of this order.  However, I say at once that Mother's position has now changed and she does not oppose the adoption order even on an emotional basis.  I will say more about this in due course but her stance today is very much to her credit.  The only live issue before me at this stage is that Mother seeks a section 8 contact order permitting direct contact once a year between her and both boys.  That application is opposed by the adopters, by the local authority and by the children's guardian.  

 

There is a rather long and difficult litigation history in this matter.  I shall set it out briefly, however I should say that three other judges of this court have dealt with this case: His Honour Judge Serota QC, His Honour Judge McIntyre and District Judge Perusko.  I have had the benefit of transcripts of their judgments and should this judgment be transcribed this judgment should be read together with all three of those judgments because although I will briefly set out the history, I cannot do justice to the litigation history in this ex tempore judgment.  

 

Briefly, the children were removed from their parents' care on 23 June 2011 and placed into police protection following a police raid on the mother's address.  The parents were arrested, remanded in custody and subsequently charged with conspiracy to manage and keep brothels between the period 2 March 2008 and 24 June 2011.  On 24 June 2011 the local authority applied for an emergency protection order and subsequently the children were made the subject of repeated interim care orders.  Mother pleaded guilty to the criminal offences in December 2011 and after trial Father was convicted in March 2012.  I am told Father remains in prison.  Mother was sentenced to two and a half years' imprisonment but was released on 10 October 2012.  I have read the judgment of His Honour Judge Serota QC, who dealt with the care proceedings.  He handed judgment down on 21 November 2012.  He set out in his judgment his concerns about the care these children had received and he found that the children had suffered significant harm in the care of their parents.  I do not want to go into detail of the findings of His Honour Judge Serota because I am keenly aware of how distressing today is for the mother but I have taken into account the findings that His Honour Judge Serota QC made and in particular the judge's concerns about Mother's ability to engage openly and honestly with professionals, given the evidence of the psychologist instructed in that case.   His Honour Judge Serota QC made a care order and a placement order in respect of both children.  Mother applied for permission to appeal that decision and this was refused on paper by Black LJ on 25 March 2013.  Mother then applied to revoke the placement orders in respect of both children on the basis that there had been a sufficient change of circumstances since the final hearing.  Once again I have read the judgment of His Honour Judge McIntyre on 22 April 2013.  Once again I do not want to cause distress to the mother to set out why her application was refused but I have taken on board the gravity of those concerns and why that application was refused.  The plans for the children's placement with the prospective adopters were in fact delayed as a result of a stay imposed by the Court of Appeal following Mother's application for leave to appeal the dismissal for application for permission to revoke the placement orders.  The timing of this stay was unfortunate because introductions had commenced between the children and the prospective adopters and it is said in the local authority evidence that this caused the children distress.  I do not place any weight on that; Mother had every right to exhaust all appeal avenues but it is another part of the history of these children which leads them to have had such unsettled care arrangements.  Mother's last direct contact with these children was on 2 May 2013.  The prospective adopters issued an adoption application on 29 August 2013.  Mother's application for leave to oppose the adoption applications came before District Judge Perusko on 10 January 2014 and he handed down a judgment on 23 January 2014 refusing Mother's application.  Mother has not sought to appeal that decision.  Once again I have read that judgment and taken on board the concerns of the court.  On 6 February 2014 Mother applied for a contact order, in fact under section 26 of the Adoption and Children Act.  That is opposed by the adopters, by the local authority and by the children's guardian and I have read all the accompanying supporting statements by the parties in respect of their respective positions.  I have also read the annex A report.  

 

I am grateful to the parties, who have assisted me with the law.  I turn firstly to the adoption.  Pursuant to section 47(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, the court has jurisdiction to make an adoption order where three matters are established: the child has been placed for adoption by the adoption agency with the prospective adopters in whose favour the order is proposed to be made, the child was placed for adoption under a placement order and no parent or guardian opposes the making of an adoption order.  I have already set out that Mother cannot legally oppose the making of the order because her permission application was refused.  In any event her position today is that she supports the making of the order.  I must of course have particular regard in coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child that the paramount consideration of the court must be the child's welfare throughout his or her life under section 1(2) of the Adoption and Children Act and that I must have regard to the Welfare Checklist as set out under section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  Therefore, when I look at the application for an adoption order in respect of each child I say at once that I have read all the documents in this case but I have been particularly assisted by the statements of the social worker, Miss Pinnington, the statements of Mother, the annex A report and the report and addendum report of the children's guardian.  

 

I have also of course borne in mind the history as set out in the judgments to which I have already referred.  However of key importance today is the evidence of Mother herself.  I am very pleased that  mother felt able to tell me how she felt and I think it important that these children know that their mother attended court and was able to express exactly what she thought about this application.  Despite an adoption application before the court, she will always be their biological mother and they will always want to know about her.  Mother explained to me her position as follows and I hope I will be forgiven for reading out her evidence (through an interpreter) in full:

 
"I would like to see my children because I have brought their lives into this world.  Wherever they live, so long as they are happy I will have peace of mind.  I am aware the guardian and the social worker and everyone involved thinks it is best for the children to be adopted and I have now come to accept that.  I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in caring for my sons, including the guardian, the social worker and the foster parents.  I would like to see my children, not that I want to know where they live but I want to see them to make sure they are happy and well and then I will feel satisfied.  I will not seek to disrupt their lives.  I support the decision of the guardian, of the social worker and the court and of the adoptive parents but on the other hand I would like to see the children to have first hand knowledge of how well they are studying and how tall they have grown and whether they are happy.  I am aware I have made many mistakes in the past but after this transformation over the past one and a half years I have come to accept the judgment of the court and the suggestion of the guardian and the social worker but I would also like the court to consider my needs in seeing the children once a year so that I can feel happy and I would treasure the time of seeing them that they are happy.  I would like my children to know that they are fortunate people in this world; they have two mothers.  They have one mother who is the biological mother giving birth to them and another mother to nurture them and bring them up.  They would be the most fortunate people in the world."

It is very much to Mother's credit that she has taken this stance and it will be of very great comfort to both boys to know that Mother has been able to put her needs to one side and prioritise their best interests.  Whilst incredibly hard for Mother to do this, I commend her for it.  However, even with Mother's standpoint on the adoption I must be satisfied that adoption is in the best interests of each boy separately for the rest of his life.  

I have reminded myself of the dicta in the now well-known case of Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  I have reminded myself of the draconian nature of adoption and that it can only be countenanced when it is the only realistic option available to the child or children involved.  It is an order of last resort.   In considering this issue I have had regard to the extended welfare checklist at section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  I have considered the factors set out under that section.  Nobody argues other than the pressing need of these two little boys is for stability, security and permanence.  No one suggests other than these prospective adopters are meeting all of their needs.  I have read the annex A report.  The children are reported to be thriving and the prospective adopters are reported to be particularly sensitive to the children's needs.  I am particularly comforted also to know that there is a very good cultural match in this case and that the identity needs of these children are going to be very well met.  

 

I have read the report of the children's guardian and I consider in particular at D16, paragraphs 7 and 8.  The guardian has said the following:

 
"On 20 December 2013 I met the adoptive parents and observed H and R.  It is my view that the adoptive parents are able to meet all of the children's needs and in particular their understanding of the Chinese culture.  I was informed that the children settled quickly with no emotional or behavioural problems.  I observed the children to relate well and spontaneously to the adoptive parents, who responded in a caring and affectionate manner.  The adoptive parents informed me that the children have been welcomed by the wider family and have integrated into the local community.  H has attended school, has made friends and is making good academic progress.  R is benefiting from the stimulation and socialisation provided by his attendance at nursery."


Therefore, having looked at the section 1(4) criteria and considering the evidence I am satisfied that the best interests of these children are met in this adoptive placement.  I am heartened, as I say, by the stance of the mother and although I have constantly considered the draconian nature of the order I am going to make, I have no hesitation whatsoever in finding that it is in the interests of each of these children separately to remain placed together in this very special and very good adoptive placement under an adoptive order.  I make the order.  

 

Turning then to contact.  Although the application before the court is for a section 26 contact order, Mother in fact seeks a section 8 order but of course no technical point has been taken about it.  I am reminded of section 46(6) of the Adoption and Children Act, which provides that before making an adoption order the court must consider whether there should be arrangements for allowing any person contact with the child and for that purpose the court must consider any existing or proposed arrangements and obtain the views of the parties to the proceedings.  A contact order made in relation to an adoptive child is made under section 8 of the Children Act and is governed by the Welfare Checklist in section 1(3) of that act.  I am grateful to the parties for helpfully referring me to a number of authorities.  I have been referred to Re P (A Child) [2008] EWCA Civ 535 at paragraph 154.  That assists me with the right time to adjudicate on contact.  What it in fact says:

 
"We do not know if our views on contact on the facts of this particular case presage a more general sea change in post adoption contact overall. It seems to us, however, that the stakes in the present case are sufficiently high to make it appropriate for the court to retain control over the question of the children's welfare throughout their respective lives under sections 1, 26, 27 and 46(6) of the 2002 Act; and, if necessary, to make orders for contact post adoption in accordance with section 26 of the 2002 Act, under section 8 of the 1989 Act. This is what Parliament has enacted. In section 46(6) of the 2002 Act Parliament has specifically directed the court to consider post adoption contact, and in section 26(5) Parliament has specifically envisaged an application for contact being heard at the same time as an adoption order is applied for. All this leads us to the view that the 2002 Act envisages the court exercising its powers to make contact orders post adoption, where such orders are in the interests of the child concerned."


That is an important passage because it reminds me that I have the jurisdiction to make the defined section 8 contact order and indeed in certain circumstances to control contact by the court post the adoption.  

I have set out at length the mother's views about contact and I cannot put them more succinctly than she does herself, save that the thrust of her case is now:

 
"I want contact simply to make sure that they are well and to reassure them that I am well.  I do not want to disrupt the contact.  I will abide by any conditions and I have moved a very, very long way from the position in the past."

I understand the mother's views, I sympathise with the mother's views and I feel a great deal of compassion for her.  However, I also have  to consider the views of the professionals, the local authority social worker, the children's guardian and not least the prospective adopters.  The prospective adopters do not support direct contact.  I have been informed that they have been asked as recently as I think yesterday.  I have of course been referred to the case of Oxfordshire County Council v X, Y & J [2010] EWCA Civ 581.  Paragraph 36 says the following:
"It is a strong thing to impose on adoptive parents, it is "extremely unusual" to impose on adoptive parents, some obligation which they are unwilling voluntarily to assume, certainly where, as here, the adoption order has already been made. Was there a proper basis for taking that extremely unusual step? In our judgment there was not. The judge found that the adoptive parents were genuine when they expressed their concerns, so what was the justification for imposing on them something they conscientiously and reasonably objected to, particularly when, as we have seen, they say that they have not ruled out the possibility of letting the natural parents have photographs in the future? As we have said, they are not to be saddled with an order merely because a judge takes a different view. The adoptive parents are J's parents; the natural parents are not. The adoptive parents are the only people with parental responsibility for J. Why, unless the circumstances are unusual, indeed extremely unusual � and here, in our judgment, they are neither � should that responsibility be usurped by the court? We can see no good reason either on the facts or in law. On the contrary, there is much force in the point they make, that they wish their status as J's parents to be respected and seen to be inviolable � not for themselves but in order, as they see it, to give J the very best chance for the adoption to be successful."



The concerns of the local authority are that even if Mother is true to her word now and has no intention of destabilising the placement, the concern of the local authority is that the mere fact of contact may destabilise this placement.  The evidence of the social worker at C133 of the bundle, paragraphs 15 and 16 set out the distress and reluctance that both children showed in January and February 2013 when the local authority social worker tried to facilitate contact between the boys with their mother.  In fact, R refused to attend the January and February contact altogether and became very distressed.  I am told in that evidence that the children only attended the last contact because the foster carer attended that contact with them.  I do not intend to read those two paragraphs out but I place weight on the distress caused to these children by that contact.  Therefore, the adopters and the child care professionals are extremely concerned about the disruption of this placement by any direct contact.  Mother has given evidence on oath that she supports the placement and promises not to disrupt the placement.  Even if she is genuine about this, these children have been found to have suffered significant harm in her care and the concern of the professionals and the adopters is the fact that contact will disrupt the placement due to the children being emotionally unsettled or confused by it.  It may trigger anxiety in them in respect of why contact has resumed when in their minds they are settled and in their forever family.  There is also concern that with the history of litigation Mother may say that she has accepted this adoption and may even really mean it but she may never really be satisfied with this level of contact and may constantly push for more contact over the years.  

 

On behalf of Mother, Ms. Grieve argues that I can find that this case falls into the extremely unusual category that I would have to find to impose contact on these unwilling adopters.  She argues that I should not rely too heavily on the distress that the children showed in early 2013; they were unsettled at that time.  They have now had a long time to settle into their placement. They can be reassured that contact does not mean they are moving from that placement and that Mother has undergone a significant psychological shift, something that Mother herself calls her "transformation".  Mother supports adoption, she will abide by any conditions and therefore I should see this as one of those extremely unusual cases.  

 

When I consider the addendum report of the children's guardian he has said the following.  I have in particular looked at paragraphs 18 to 25 of the addendum report and that is at E59 and 60 of the bundle.  Again, I do not want to read out the entire paragraphs but perhaps paragraphs 21 and 22 are needed.  Mr Slade has said:

 
"The adoptive parents assured me that they will listen to the wishes and feelings of the children as they grow older in all matters pertaining to their development.  If they do not respond appropriately to the wishes expressed by the children in that regard the boys might exhibit behavioural problems.  The adoptive parents are willing to seek professional help on this issue if they feel some direct contact with the birth parents becomes appropriate.  I think that the children are highly likely to be confused and distressed if direct contact becomes prescriptive by means of a court order.  The children do not require a physical link to their mother and maternal family to have an understanding of them.  I would be concerned as to the effect on the children of ongoing direct contact between Miss S and the boys given their reported reactions to contact immediately prior to and following the wish you well contact.  As noted at paragraphs 9 and 10 above, I am concerned that the positive, trusting relationship the boys have formed with the prospective adopters would be undermined by being forced to see their mother when it appears clear they do not want to see her at this time."

I have considered section 1(3) of the Welfare Checklist.  It seems to me going through those factors these children have made it very clear they want to remain in this placement and sadly they have also made it clear that they do not require or want direct contact with their mother at the moment.  Once again their pressing need is for stability, security and permanence and anything which undermines or potentially undermines that security cannot be seen to be in their best interests.  Mother accepts that at this stage she is not going to look after these children and that the adoptive parents must be given the respect, space and liberty to care for these children because they are now in law their own children. Looking through the section 1(3) checklist, I cannot identify anything which leads me to take a view that it would be in the best interests of these children to impose a contact order on these children and adopters which, in my judgment brings with it an unacceptably high risk of destabilisation of the placement at this time, even if Mother is true to her word that she will not deliberately disrupt this placement.  

 

I come to this decision with a heavy heart.  It is always extremely sad for a birth parent to be told that at the present time there are no plans for direct contact.  However, I have applied the law in this case, I have looked very carefully at the evidence and in my judgment it is not in the best interests of these children to make a section 8 contact order and I refuse to do so.

JUDGE SCARRATT:  

 The background of this case I take from the local authority's case summary.  The child S was born on 7th January 2013 and, therefore, she is just one year old.  Her mother (M) is CR, her father (F) is WN.  The parents live together.  They are not married.  The F is named on S's birth certificate and he, thus, shares parental responsibility for her.  The application for a care order in respect of S was issued on 15th July 2013 and the application for a placement order in respect of S was issued on 13th January of this year.

 
All parties are represented.  S is represented by her guardian.  The history goes back some little time, when in June 2012 there was a referral to social services concerning the M.  There were concerns about her pregnancy, vulnerability and health in respect of epileptic seizures, or what was thought to be epilepsy, and also recent and ongoing contact with her father, TR, who was suspected of sexually abusing the M when she was about six years old.  These investigations proceeded and I have looked at the chronology in some detail in the court bundle.  The local authority was concerned about the M's relationship with her own father and what might have happened, although there were no criminal proceedings and no fact finding has taken place, but they were very concerned about the M's vulnerability and there was, certainly on the face of the papers, a history of eating disorder and alcohol abuse.  Consequently, the local authority appointed a family nurse, a Miss Kelly Irvine, for the family. There is a report from Miss Irvine in the bundle.  She sets out a number of concerns about the parents' ability to provide good enough parenting for S.  I will refer to that later in this judgment.  The M was referred to the local children's centre and did not attend as she should have done, and there were various concerns during the pregnancy which are documented in the bundle.  The child was born.  The parents went to live with the paternal grandfather.  The local authority were concerned about isolation as far as M was concerned, the controlling aspect of the F and, above all, about the M's seemingly limited skills in cleaning and food preparation and hygiene in general.  The local authority was concerned that she needed a lot of practical help.  The parents obtained a flat together and lived there with S shortly after she was born.  The local authority, in the chronology, set out their continuing concerns about hygiene, hazards and general concerns about how the parents could cope and were coping with the baby.  The local authority have also been concerned during this time about the F's domestic violence - again in the chronology, there have been several reported incidents and I will refer, again, to that aspect of the case later.  The local authority were concerned, too, that S was left with the maternal grandfather, against whom allegations had been made concerning sexual abuse, and also his associates, who had convictions for sexual abuse, who were around at that time, and one of whom S was taken into contact with.  And so it was that the local authority became really very concerned and consequently care proceedings were issued.

 Various directions were given.  Parenting assessments of the parents have taken place - I will come to those in a minute.  The paternal grandmother put herself forward, as did the maternal grandmother, as potential carers for S if it was found that the parents could not care for her; both of those assessments were negative, although, as far as the maternal grandmother is concerned, I think it right to say that she withdrew her application to be a carer.  A special guardianship assessment was undertaken of the paternal grandmother by Mr Bishop, an independent social worker, and his conclusion was negative in respect of the grandmother, Mrs W.  The matter was also referred to a number of experts, and I will come to them in a moment.  That is a very brief background of this case.  It is right to say - and I will descend into more detail in a moment - that during the course of these proceedings S and the M were placed in a residential foster placement with a Mrs Smith, an experienced foster carer.  That broke down and S is now with foster carers.  She is, I am told, thriving and I am told that contact between her and her parents has on the whole been good.

 

 The law to which I have to have regard, is well known, and the recent decision in Re B-S is at the forefront of my mind.  There are two applications before the court today.  One is by the local authority for a care order and the second is for a placement order.  I remind myself that the local authority brings the case, it is up to the local authority to prove its case; the parents need to prove nothing.  And it is for the local authority to satisfy me that the threshold set out in s.31 of the Children Act 1989 is met.  The welfare of the child is paramount - s.1 of the Children Act - and I have the welfare checklist at s.1(3) of that Act well in mind.  I also have well in mind the draconian nature of the orders sought, and I particularly have in mind the recent decision in Re B, a child [2013] The Supreme Court, page 33, where the Supreme Court made it perfectly clear that: 

 

		"Only in exceptional circumstances were care orders with a view to adoption to be considered the appropriate outcome of public law proceedings.  Such an order was an order of last resort and could only be justified by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare and only where necessary to protect the interests of the child, where nothing else will do."

The starting point was explained in Re C and B, a well known case, where Hale LJ stated as follows:

		"Cutting off all contact in the relationship between a child or children and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child."

These are draconian orders that the local authority are seeking and, of course, the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Re B-C (children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 further clarifies that:

		"Children should be brought up in their natural family, ideally by the natural parents or at least one of them, unless the overriding requirements of the child's welfare makes that not possible.  The court must consider all the options before coming to a decision.  What these options are will depend upon the circumstances of the particular cases.  They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to the making of an adoption order at the other."

Again, directing the court to the draconian nature of the order sought by the local authority.  Again, in Re B-C, it is stated that:

		"The court's assessment of the parents' ability to discharge their responsibilities towards the child must take into account the assistance and support which the authorities would offer."

And then it cites, again, Re B, where Lord Neuberger said as follows:

		"Before making an adoption order in such a case, the court must be satisfied that there is no practical way of the authorities or others providing the requisite assistance and support, underlining the fact that every avenue has to be explored to see whether or not it is at all possible for a child to be reunited and brought up by his or her family."

And so, the case before the court is for a care order in respect of S and a placement order in respect of S.  The local authority's case for those orders is supported by the guardian, who represents S.  The parents' position is, very clearly, that they would wish S to be returned to them as a couple so that they can parent her throughout her minority.  The parents' case, furthermore, is that, if that is not possible, if S cannot be returned to the parents, then she should be cared for by Mrs W, the paternal grandmother.  Those are the positions of the parties.

 In this case I have heard evidence from each of the parents, from the foster carer, Mrs Smith, from both social workers (the current social worker and the previous social worker), I have heard from the paternal grandmother, I have also heard from Mr Brian Bishop, the independent social worker who assessed the paternal grandmother in the light of her application for a special guardianship order.  I have read the court bundles.  I have read, especially, the evidence of Dr Jones, the psychiatrist reporting as to the mother's mental health, and Annie Stubbley, the psychologist reporting on both parents.  I have also, as I have already mentioned, read a report from the family nurse, Miss Kelly Irvine.  She sets out a number of concerns in respect of the parents' ability to provide good enough parenting for S.  I have looked at the cognitive assessment of Mr Dowsett.  He opines that:

 

		"The mother has average intellectual ability but that she does not have learning difficulties."

There are medical reports concerning the mother's health, and Dr Redmond reports that:

		"The mother probably suffers from epilepsy and possible non-epileptic attacks with a psychological basis."

In reaching the decisions I have, I have based them on all of the evidence; that is, the written evidence in the bundles - some of it is challenged, some is not - and the oral evidence of the witnesses that I have heard.  If in this extempore judgment I do not mention parts of the evidence, oral or written, it is not because I have ignored it or forgotten it; it is just that other parts are more relevant.

 The experts' evidence comprises, as I have mentioned already, of a psychiatrist, Dr Jones.  She reported in October of last year.  She was not called to give evidence; her evidence is accepted by the parties.  She concluded - and I read these conclusions, having read the reports as set out in the local authority summary - that:

 

		"The mother presented as immature and child-like.  She struggled to keep herself safe.  She had self-harmed and been victimised in relationships.  She struggled to mature emotionally and had severe personality problems.  She engaged in relationships, particularly with men, who are at risk of sexually exploiting her or emotionally or physically abusing her."

She concluded that this was a lady who had significant problems functioning in practical ways, and she mentioned especially the fact, as indeed I heard in evidence from the M herself, that she has a very close relationship with her F, the maternal grandfather, and the psychiatrist, Dr Jones, thought that the mother could turn a blind eye to the risks posed by him and his associates.  It is right to record that those conclusions reached by Dr Jones were reached despite the fact that Dr Jones did not have access to the M's medical records, but that was her unchallenged evidence.

 Annie Stubbley, the psychologist, reported in respect of both the M and the F.  Again, she was not called to give evidence and that evidence is, therefore, unchallenged.  In short, she opined, as far as the M is concerned, that:

 

		"The M would be unable to recognise early grooming behaviour and S would be in those circumstances at an increased risk of sexual abuse.  That risk was significant having regard to the maternal grandfather's known associations with a number of sex offenders ..."

and their names appeared in evidence in this case, and she took note of M's limited alternative social support network.  She considered that M, and S in her care, would remain vulnerable to exploitation, and she thought that that would be the case until any psychotherapeutic work was undertaken - work identified by Dr Jones.  Miss Stubbley thought the M unable to consistently prioritise S's needs above her own, and the psychologist considered the M unable to start the psychotherapeutic work to address her personality difficulties until she considered and accepted the benefits of such therapy and was willing to engage.  That work would last some year to 18 months.  She also thought that both parents would benefit from some form of educative parenting programme to help them to identify and manage any risk of sexual abuse to S.  She further considered in respect of the F that the M's relationship with her own father was a likely source of conflict in the relationship between the parents.

		"The F may be more open to considering whether the maternal grandfather may pose a risk of sexual abuse to S."

She considered that:

		"The F underestimated the difficulties that he and M were likely to face in their relationship - exemplified by their reconciliation before completing work that he accepted to be necessary."

She, Miss Stubbley, identified F having problems with inter-personal relationships and, again, she pointed out that a year to 18 months of psychotherapy would be required by the F to address the issues that she sets out underlying the psychological root of his problems.  She did not consider that short courses, such as CDAP, to deal with his domestic violence would address all of the concerns.

 This has been a short case but it is no less important because of that, for the reasons as I have explained, concerning the draconian nature of the orders sought.  The evidence has taken about a day and, in the context of care cases, that is not a long case.  I intend to summarise the salient points of the oral evidence that I heard.

 

 Mrs Smith, the foster carer, assured the court that she had given a balanced report and had not concentrated on the negatives.  Mrs Smith ran the home where the M and S went to live when the court allowed there to be a mother and baby foster placement.  The M has alleged that the foster carer concentrated on the negatives, but Mrs Smith's evidence, which chimed with her written evidence, was that, "The M was very oppositional" and not motivated.  As she put it in evidence, she did not improve from "first base": "She didn't take my advice" and the police were called when the placement broke down.  There appears to have been a bit of a struggle.  M was not prepared, Mrs Smith stated in evidence, to keep S safe and to ensure S's safety.  She did acknowledge the stress involved in being in such a placement and she felt that the M felt at times stressed in a placement, being watched, as it were, and she did note some improvements on the M's part, although she was unable to maintain, Mrs Smith said, the improvements that she noted.

 

 The current social worker, Miss Sarah Griffin, gave evidence.  She was cross-examined by the parents.  She placed quite considerable weight on an announced visit very recently to the parents' home.  That took place on 17th January this year.  She told me that the home was in quite a state.  She painted a vivid picture of very poor housekeeping and home-making, and in answer to the guardian in cross-examination, she described the home circumstances as "filthy".  She considered there to be no significant change in the parents' behaviour and outlook.  She was very concerned about the M's very close relationship with her father, who had allegedly sexually abused M, as I have said, when the M herself was a child.  She was concerned about domestic violence, although she accepted that there were no reported incidents of late.  That chimed with the F's evidence.  She confirmed that the trigger to these proceedings was in fact the M's involvement with her father's associates, including his partner, who herself has a conviction for sexual abuse, and these associates were known sex offenders.  She was very concerned about the M's vulnerability, as she saw it, to grooming.  As Miss Griffin said:

 

		"I am not sure she would see through it."

The social worker was less confident, now that S was older and more mobile, that the parents would cope if S came home.  The tenor of her evidence was that, despite telling her that they would do this and that, it just was not happening.  She said to the court:

		"They don't seem to be able to pull it altogether."

She considered all the parents' difficulties to be deep-rooted.  Nothing had changed significantly, even with the local authority involvement and these ongoing proceedings.  She also considered the relationship between the M and F to be itself fragile.

 I heard evidence from Mrs W, the paternal grandmother, who I have allowed to sit in court with the permission of the parties.  She assured the court that she would assist the local authority with life story work if it was required, and she said S was her own flesh and blood.  She denied that she was less than committed to having S at home with her.  It was pointed out to her in cross-examination that she had left it late to obtain legal advice as to her position in these proceedings, and indeed medical reports about her own health.  She disagreed with Mr Bishop's report that she could not provide what Mr Bishop called "the optimum safe placement" for S.  Mr Bishop was particularly emphasizing the risk to S through contact with the maternal grandfather and the consequent risk of grooming.  

 

 Mr Bishop, the independent social worker, was himself cross-examined, but he did not resile from his conclusion in his report that S should not be placed with Mrs W, her grandmother.  He did not feel that she appreciated the significance of what had occurred, especially as regards contact with the maternal grandfather and his associates with convictions for sexual abuse.  She gave the impression, certainly to Mr Bishop, that she did not in fact have great familial support.

 

 I heard from the previous social worker, Miss Nichol Young.  She confirmed the local authority's case that its involvement was because of the M leaving S in the care of  a convicted sex abuser and her association with friends or associates of her F.  She was also very concerned as to the home conditions - and I take note of the chronology in the bundle as to that and examples set out therein - and she was also concerned with the parents' ability to care for themselves, leaving aside S, and their reluctance to seek help.  This was a view expressed, too, in the evidence, both written and oral, of Miss Griffin, the current social worker.  

 

 I paid great attention to the parents' oral evidence.  The M, when asked about her relationship with the F, saw no problems with it.  She described it as "brilliant".  She did not consider now that there were any anger management problems and she would prove this, she told me, if S was returned to their care.  She emphasized to the court that she would protect S from her F and from any sexual abuse and from any grooming.  She said she had learnt a lot.  "People are not what they seem", she said.  But she did accept her closeness to her F and her emotional dependency upon him.  She herself - and I give her credit for being candid - described her home conditions as, "Bad but improved".  She said that in the foster placement with Mrs Smith, she, Mrs Smith, was violent to her, that she was taught nothing after the second week there, and she asked the court for another chance to be a good parent.  She said that her partner, the F, was more supportive, that she obtained more support from him, that they would not struggle "as we once did", she said.  She told me that she had no relationship with her own M.  She was not oppositional, as described by the foster carer.  She disputed that evidence.  She thought it was a personality clash between Mrs Smith and herself.  She put the fact of S and her meeting the sexual abusers as, "A horrible coincidence" and she, again, repeated the fact that she had learnt a lot, that she now would not trust people at face value, and she agreed it was a bad decision to allow Mr Kruger (her father's associate) to take images of her whilst she was wearing her underwear.

 

 F told me that he was not as stressed as he was.  He told me that his anger management was much better and he felt it was under control, and in fact, again to be fair to the F, he said that he was "disgusted" with his previous violence to women.  He told me how he was addressing the problems.  He had had a telephone appointment with KCA recently and others with East Kent ITEC.  He hoped to attend CDAP.  He contacted them last May but was awaiting appointments.  It seemed to me that he was attempting to address these problems, if very late in the day - and I note how recent some of his contacts to these various establishments  are.

 

 The guardian provided the court with a full analysis.  She was cross-examined by the parties.  She did not resile from her conclusions, nor from her support of the local authority and its care plan.  She emphasized to the court the multiple risk factors in this case.  They all remained, in her view.  She particularly emphasized, in the light of the dicta in Re BS concerning support packages from local authorities, that one could not expect the social worker to be present all of the time overseeing every detail of family life if S was returned to the parents.  She said that it was not practical for the local authority to provide that care.  She said in evidence that, despite the paternal grandmother's best efforts in trying to get her son and his partner to clean up the flat and change their housekeeping methods, she was unable to effect the change needed, and the guardian considered that she would be in an unenviable position if S was returned to the parents.  She thought the M's problems deep-seated and she agreed with Miss Stubbley's report - in fact, she described Miss Stubbley's report (the psychologist) as a very good report.  Importantly - and I particularly took note of this evidence - she felt that S did not have an attachment to anyone and she thought that this was worthy of note, and it is something that Miss Stubbley comments on, too, in her report.  She gave the F credit for looking out for suitable courses but she felt that these courses would not tackle the underlying cause of his psychological difficulties - and in that sense she supported what Miss Stubbley had opined in her report.  As far as both parents were concerned, she said that the advised therapy (12 to 18 months) was outside of S's timescales.  She emphasized that she, too, had observed some of the concerns of the foster carer.  She thought that the M was in fact very oppositional to the foster carer, Mrs Smith.  She saw when she visited the foster placement - and gave quite a vivid picture in evidence - what she described as the totally unacceptable standards of, for example, washing up piled up for some days, and she reminded the court that at the first hearing the guardian did not support the local authority's case; the guardian wanted to see whether this child could be placed with the parents and at that first hearing she was instrumental, she reminded the court, in obtaining a residential assessment for mother and baby.  She gave an example, too, of how, when she was sitting in a room next door to S and her M, she could not hear any conversation, and this troubled her.  She thought that there should be almost non-stop communication between M and baby, and she did not hear M in a way that she thought was appropriate.  She considered that S not responding was poor interaction between M and daughter.  She found the M at times - as did Mrs Smith - was not open for advice.  Again, towards the end of her evidence, she repeated her concern about the multiple risk factors in this case.  She was happy to hear about the F's positive contact with his daughter.  

 
So, that is the oral evidence - the guardian not changing the conclusion contained within her report.  I have considered all of that evidence.

 The parents wish S to be returned to them or, if not them, to Mrs W, the paternal grandmother.  The guardian of S supports the local authority's care plan, which is placement for adoption.  The threshold criteria are conceded by the parents, save for paragraph 4 in respect of neglect.  On that point, I do find the threshold met.  I accept the evidence of the social workers, and the guardian in particular, as to S's lack of attachment to anyone, and I find that the condition of the parents' home has not really improved at all; I place some reliance upon the announced visit on 17th January - a few weeks ago - and I find that the parents lack motivation to improve themselves and their skills.  I accept that evidence from Mrs Smith and the social workers.  I am particularly concerned that the M does not appear to appreciate the concerns of the local authority in respect of her father and his associates and the importance of guarding against grooming by potential abusers.  There is ample evidence, in my judgment, to suggest that they could each have done more to satisfy the local authority and the guardian that, within S's timescales, they could have addressed the very well documented problems that existed and have existed for some time and which I find they were aware of - not least their home conditions and motivation.  Where evidence conflicts, I prefer the evidence of the local authority and the guardian.  The threshold criteria, I find are met.  

 

 I move on to deal with where S should live.  The evidence - and I remind myself, again, that this is an evidence-based exercise - leads me inexorably to the conclusion that S's best interests - her welfare being paramount - lie with her being placed outside of her family.  I accept the evidence of the guardian and the local authority's care plan.  M pleads with the court to have a second chance, and whilst I fully accept that S is much loved by her parents - the photos I have seen show a bonny baby - and I have heard good reports of contact sessions, she, at just one year of age, cannot wait for these parents to change.  I have considerable doubts, as does the local authority and the guardian, that these parents can change within S's time-frames.  I find a lack of motivation on their part and I point to the residential assessment, the F's slowness at organising the courses that he told me about, the state of the home, even on an announced visit and less than a month ago, and the experts' reports, too, which point to underlying difficulties which are outside of S's time-frames if they are to be treated and dealt with.  I accept the evidence of Mr Bishop as far as Mrs W is concerned.  Whilst I think she will be able to assist very well with life story work for S, she is in no position to have her live with her on a permanent basis.  I am not satisfied, like Mr Bishop, that she is as committed as she would like to think, or indeed thinks herself.  That is not to say that she does not love S dearly and want the best for her.  I bear in mind the draconian nature of the orders sought.  They are to be made as a last resort.  I have dealt with the law and, in particular, with the authority of Re B-S.  I have concluded that S's welfare can only be promoted through a care order, the threshold criteria having been met.  If returned to her parents' sole care, she would, in my judgment, be at risk of significant harm.  I therefore make a care order in respect of S.

 

 The parents oppose placement for adoption.  I am quite satisfied that all avenues and options have been explored and analyzed.  I stand back and look at all those options - the global approach, as detailed in Re B-S.  I am wholly satisfied that S's welfare now and for the remainder of her minority will be in an adoptive placement.  I have considered the welfare and adoption checklist as set out in statute.  I have considered her welfare now and in the future and as an adopted person.  The parents do not consent to such a course.  I understand their position.  I therefore dispense with their consent, S's welfare requiring me so to dispense.  I make a placement order in respect of S.

 

 I do appreciate how sad the parents will be with these orders and I have more than once acknowledged their love for their daughter.  I hope that once the dust settles, if it ever does, that they will appreciate that this court has done what is best for S and not necessarily what the parents might wish.  She is the first priority in the court's eyes.  I hope that they can meet with any potential adopters, as this may assist them with coming to terms with these orders and, of course, it will assist S as she moves forward.  Their assistance with life story work and this judgment will also help S know all about them, their love for her and why she was unable to live with them.  This is the judgment of the court.

HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT

I continue to be concerned with proceedings in respect of a child, B, who was born on 13th November 2012, so he is 14 months old.  By an application dated 10th April 2013, Wakefield Council applied for a care order in respect of B.  They have also applied for a placement order by application dated 13 December 2013.

 
Representation  
Wakefield City Council was represented by Counsel, Miss Mason.  B's mother, Miss C was represented by Ms Shergill.  M did not attend the hearing. Miss Heckinbottom represented R's father.  F did not attend the hearing.  B was represented by Mr George, taking his instructions from the children's guardian, Mrs Curtis.  

 
Forensic Background
The case was listed for final hearing commencing 23rd September with a time estimate of five days.  It was clearly not possible for the matter to be concluded at that time because the care plan was one of adoption and the maternal grandfather, who cares for another of the mother's children and had done so without question or concern for over a year, put himself forward as a potential permanent carer for B.  I expressed surprise that the Local Authority did not approach him earlier, and indeed I have been told today that in fact he had been approached and had declined to be assessed.

 
As can be seen from my earlier judgment in this case, the medical evidence in relation to B's alleged injuries was scheduled to be heard on 24th September 2013, with two consultants due to give evidence.  I had previously indicated that I did not view this case as necessitating a split hearing, especially since it is not a single-issue case but I took the pragmatic approach to treat the hearing as a fact finding into the injuries alone and to use the court time and the medical experts as productively as possible.  That hearing was not a threshold hearing. It was held only to determine the causation of haematomas which developed on B's head and were observed by professionals at A and E in the early hours of 13th March 2013, which by paragraph 1 of their threshold document the Local Authority sought a finding had occurred non accidentally. I gave judgment in that part of the hearing on 13 September 2013. 

 
This judgment deals with the threshold criteria in respect of B and my decision on the application for a care order with a care plan of adoption, and the application for a placement order.

 
When I adjourned this case for final hearing the plan was that Mr J, maternal grandfather, would be assessed as a carer for B. He cares for M's older daughter and hoped that he could care for B with M's support. In mid October M reconciled with S, father of her younger daughter. As a result Mr J withdrew from the assessment as he acknowledged that he could not care for both children on his own.

 
On 3 December M made an application for an ISW assessment of herself and S as joint carers of B because it was clear that her father was no longer putting himself forward as a potential carer for B. This application was listed before me at the Issues Resolution hearing which took place on 17 December 2013. At that hearing the application was not pursued by Mr Maxwell-Stewart because M did not attend the hearing, she was not attending contact and she was not cooperating with social services. Indeed, M last attended contact on 16 December 2013. Her own mother died in December 2013 and it is believed that M is now living at her deceased mother's address.

 
Factual background  
M and F are still teenagers. They have had an on/off sexual relationship of limited duration. B was conceived during a 3 month period when they were together following which they have not continued the relationship. DNA tests showed that F is B's father on 17 April last year. F does not hold parental responsibility for B.

 
M has two older children. One lives with M's father. The other lives with her natural father, S. They were both the subject of Child Protection plans from July 2011 to January 2012 under the category of neglect. In March 2012 they were taken into police protection and removed from their M's care. When B was born he was made the subject of a child protection plan. He lived with his mother with his step father in the home of the maternal grandmother. A serious incident of domestic violence occurred between the couple on New Years Eve but the couple remained in a relationship. B moved to live with M alone from 30 January 2013 at a teenage pregnancy project. There were several breaches of the TPP rules, with M staying away from the project.  A legal planning meeting on 28 February decided that whilst threshold for care proceedings was met, M was giving B a "good enough" standard of care, and proceedings would not be pursued. There was a plan to support M with nursery provision and safe relationship/ self esteem courses.

 
On 13th March, shortly after midnight, B was taken to A and E with bilateral haematomas or swellings over his temples.  He had a CT scan and X-rays and blood tests.  He had no bleeding to the brain and no fractures.  In fact there were no external manifestations of injury to his head at all, no bruising, no lesions, no other marks. B's platelet count was very, very low and he was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary with a view to further assessment. The medical evidence about the platelet count was that B had developed immune thrombocytopenia, ITP. On 19th March, B was voluntarily accommodated at the time when he would be due for discharge from hospital.  The Local Authority applied for a care order on 10th April on the basis that B had been non accidentally injured whilst in the care of M.  M was offered a high level of contact, over half of which she did not attend.

 
In a statement dated the 30th April, M said that she had been dishonest about the circumstances of presentation on 10th March.  She said that actually she had been carrying B in a bouncer and that she had lied because she was very concerned that he would be removed from her care. 

 
Parenting assessments of M in August and December 2013 were negative because although M clearly loves B she cannot identify his needs and keep focussed upon them. M has experienced neglectful parenting herself and she has had several relationships and moves which have meant she has lacked emotional and physical stability. M has shown some recent insight into her position and does not put herself forward as a carer for B.

 
F and his mother were assessed as potential carers for B. The viability assessment of them was negative because the family has had a long history of social work involvement due to issues of domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse and problematic relationships. F himself has ongoing drug issues and is immature. F does not seek to challenge the assessment or put himself forward as a carer for B and a position statement was filed on his behalf this morning stating that he did not oppose the orders sought by the Local Authority.

 
The Evidence  
The written evidence is contained in a bundle supplied to all parties by the Local Authority. I did not hear oral evidence at this stage of the proceedings. The representatives for the parents did not seek to challenge any of the written evidence. I did not need to hear the social worker or the Children's Guardian because their reports are clear and comprehensive.

 
            The Parties' positions- Threshold
The Local Authority contends that the threshold under s 31(2) Children Act 1989 is met by virtue of my finding of fact that M had admitted that on "�10 March 2013 she carried B in a baby bouncer without strapping him in.  She knew that he should have been strapped in, but was anxious to go for her lunch.  She carried him through the door which hit her arm causing her to let go of one side of the bouncer and drop B from waist height.  She accepts that her actions were "very dangerous" and that she lied to the hospital about what happened to avoid social services becoming further involved."

 
The threshold document dated 12 September 2013 sought additional findings, namely that B had been exposed to domestic violence between M and S and had been brought into contact with risky adults, thereby putting him at risk of physical and emotional harm.

 
Given M's concession in the finding of fact hearing and the parents' positions at this hearing the Local Authority did not seek to litigate the issue of threshold further on the grounds of proportionality. It is of course a matter for me as to whether the threshold findings originally sought (save for the issue of the injuries) should be investigated before I can come to a final decision.

 
M's position is that she conceded exposure to risky adults in May 2013 and has not disputed the violent incident between herself and the step father in early 2013, although she has not formally conceded threshold.

 
F's position is that since threshold does not relate to his care of B as he did not take care of him he does not contest the findings sought.

 
The Children's Guardian's position is that further delay to seek to litigate the additional findings on the threshold document would be disproportionate since the case is met by what has been found or conceded.

 
I have decided that the findings I have already made in respect of M's care of B, recorded after the finding of fact hearing, taken with the concessions she has made are sufficient. I find that as a consequence of those matters B was likely to suffer significant physical and emotional harm and neglect at the time proceedings were commenced, and such harm is attributable to the care given to him, or not given to him, by his M. 

 
         The parties positions- care order and placement order applications
M's position is recorded in a statement filed on her behalf on 21 January 2014. She states that while she cannot consent to a care order or a placement order in respect of B her circumstances are such that she is not in a position to meet B's needs within his timescales. With a recording that she wants what is best for B in the long term for his security and that she loves him dearly, M records that she does not actively oppose the making of the orders sought. She also states that she will help with B's life story work and will take advantage of post adoption contact.

 
F's position is similar to M's. He is saddened by the loss of direct contact but does not oppose the orders sought. He will assist with life story work.

 
The Children's Guardian supports the Local Authority applications.

 
           The statutory framework for care and placement orders
Care orders are made in accordance with section 31 of the Children Act 1989. Placement and adoption orders are made in accordance with sections 21 and 46 respectively of the 2002 Act. 

 
Under s 21(3) of the 2002 Act the court cannot make a placement order unless either the parent has consented or the court is satisfied that the parent's consent should be dispensed with. Section 52(1) provides that the court cannot dispense with a parent's consent unless either the parent cannot be found, or lacks capacity to give consent, or the welfare of the child "requires" the consent to be dispensed with. In deciding whether or not to make a placement order my paramount consideration must be the child's welfare "throughout his life", as provided by section 1(2). I must have regard to the 'welfare checklist' in section 1(4).  I must also keep firmly to the front of my mind the guidance laid down by the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the European jurisprudence.

 
In Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 a strong court of Appeal comprising Lord Dyson MR, Sir James Munby P and Lady Justice Black gave a comprehensive review of the law in respect of cases where adoption against parental wishes is being considered. This was an appeal against a decision made by Parker J sitting in the Chelmsford County Court, refusing a mother's application under section 47(5) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 for leave to oppose the making of adoption orders in relation to her two children. The appeal was dismissed but the case not only determines the proper application of section 47(5) but also raises some very significant matters of more wide-reaching importance. In particular the full court had the opportunity of considering the decision of the Supreme Court in In re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria) [2013] UKSC 33, [2013] 1 WLR 1911.

 
Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, reminded all judges that "�it is necessary for us to go back to first principles and to emphasise a number of essential considerations that judges must always have in mind, and we emphasise this, at every stage of the process."  and I have borne these principles in my mind in this case, involving as it does the application for a care order with a plan for placement for adoption.  

 
Intervention of this type can only be justified in certain circumstances, as explained by Hale LJ, as she then was, in Re C and B [2001] 1 FLR 611, para 34 when she stated:

 
"Intervention in the family may be appropriate, but the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that, and the effort should be devoted towards that end. Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child or children and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child."
I have also reminded myself of the dicta against 'social engineering' in YC v United Kingdom (2012) 55 EHRR 967, para 134: "family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and � everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to 'rebuild' the family. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing."

 
Section 52(1)(b) of the 2002 Act provides that the consent of a parent with capacity can be dispensed with only if the welfare of the child "requires" this. The judgment in Re B-S is clear: 'Require' has the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, "the connotation of the imperative, what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable" and it is a stringent and demanding test.  This was also stressed by the Supreme Court In re B ...A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria) [2013] UKSC 33, [2013] 1 WLR 1911. Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption are "a very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do", a "last resort � when all else fails". 

 
I have also reminded myself of the provisions of the Children Act 1989 s 1(5), which, read in conjunction with s 1(3)(g), and s 1(6) of the 2002 Act, makes it clear that I should adopt the 'least interventionist' approach. In Re O (Care or Supervision Order) [1996] 2 FLR 755, 760 Hale J said:

 
"the court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach. This should be considered to be in the better interests of the children � unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary."
In Re B Lord Neuberger stressed the principle that although the child's interests in an adoption case are paramount, the court must never lose sight of the fact that those interests include being brought up by the natural family, ideally by the natural parents, or at least one of them, unless the overriding requirements of the child's welfare make that not possible. Further, section 1(3)(g) of the 1989 Act and section 1(6) of the 2002 Act provides that the court "must" consider all the options before coming to a decision. Lady Hale said it is "necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions". 

 
What are my options? They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to the making of a placement order at the other. In this case my options are limited because of the fact that no family member is in a position to put themselves forward as a realistic carer for B either in the short or medium term

 
My assessment of the parents' ability to discharge their responsibilities towards B must of course take into account the assistance and support which the Local Authority and others could offer. I must be satisfied that there is no practical way of sufficient support being put in place for B to be safely cared for within his family. Lady Justice Hale said in a different Re O (Supervision Order) [2001] EWCA Civ 16, [2001] 1 FLR 923, para 28:

 
"The local authorities must deliver the services that are needed and must secure that other agencies, including the health service, also play their part, and the parents must co-operate fully."
The local authority cannot press for a more drastic form of order, least of all press for adoption, because it is unable or unwilling to support a less interventionist form of order, and as the judge I have a duty to investigate this to ensure that resource issues are not affecting the local authority's thinking. In this case I am satisfied that the local authority has tried very hard to support B remaining within his family, from supporting M's care for him at the teenage pregnancy project, to assessing F and looking at ways to assist Mr J to care for B.

 
Two things are essential both when the court is being asked to approve a care plan for adoption and when it is being asked to make a non-consensual placement order or adoption order. First, there must be proper evidence both from the local authority and from the guardian addressing all the options which are realistically possible and an analysis of the arguments for and against each option and the nature and extent of the risk of harm in each of the options including the negatives, as well as the positives, of any plan to place a child away from her natural family. The CG has provided a clear analysis of the options in her reports which I adopt.

 
Here, as in In Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, there are limited options. At paras 49-50 McFarlane LJ said:

 
"The linear approach � is not apt where the judicial task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for the child's future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare."
My task is therefore to evaluate all the available options, undertaking a global, holistic and multi-faceted evaluation of the child's welfare which takes into account all the pros and cons of each option and then to compare each, side by side, against the competing option or options.

 
The revised Public Law Outline makes it clear that if, despite rigorous case management, I do not have the kind of evidence required to perform the requisite balancing exercise, then an adjournment should be be directed. In this case I am satisfied that there is sufficient material before me to enable me to make this difficult decision.

 
           Analysis
In respect of threshold I am satisfied that B was likely to suffer significant harm as outlined above. I therefore have a wide range of options, from no order to a placement order available to me.

 
I have carefully considered the written material in the bundle, including the statements of Hayley Goodyear and Sharon Cawthorne, the social workers, the statements of M  and F and the children's guardian's analysis and the final care plan for B. I have applied the Welfare Checklists in both the 1989 and 2002 Acts to B's circumstances. 

 
I am sure B would want to live within his family if he were able to do so. He is a normal, robust 14 month old little boy who his parents both love. He won't currently understand the circumstances in his life, but will no doubt question in the future why this decision was made. If it were possible and safe to do so I would have no hesitation in returning him to M's care or placing him with his F. I have extended the timescales in these proceedings to enable assessment of his wider family to take place because I wanted to explore all realistic options for him and because I wanted him to remain within his family if at all possible, especially since his older sisters have family placements.

 
B has suffered significant harm in the form of neglect of his needs because his M was unable to prioritise his needs above her own due to her age and lifestyle choices. She has very recently separated from S and her circumstances are once again in a state of flux and instability.  Neither parent can currently care for B and although the plan for adoption will inevitably mean a large change for B again the change proposed will give him stability and security.

 
Through adoption B will lose contact with his M and F. He will have direct contact once a month until an adoptive placement is found and thereafter will have indirect contact through the WMDC letterbox system.  He will lose the identity of being within his family, something which I do not underestimate. I have considered whether long term foster care would enable him to maintain those family links and provide a secure enough future for him. I have concluded that the disadvantages of long term foster care, including the possibility that carers will change careers, he may have frequent moves and the fact that he would always have a corporate parent will be significantly outweighed by the security that an adoptive family will bring him. I am sure that in B's case nothing else will do, and that his need for permanence without further delay means that his welfare interests demand that I make a care order with a care plan of adoption. That of course means that I must dispense with the consent of M (although with F since he does not hold PR it is not necessary) to B's placement for adoption. I do so with full understanding how they cannot bring themselves to consent to B's future being in an adoptive home and do so only because B's welfare requires me to do so.

 
           Decision
I make a care order in favour of Wakefield MDC and a placement order in respect of B, dispensing with parental consent  under s52(1)(b) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.

This is an application made by LN for permission to oppose adoption applications in respect of her two sons.  They are:

 
MJJN, who was born on 12th June 2008 and so M is now 5 years and 8 months of age; and
HMN, born on 27th January 2013 and so H is now 12�months of age. 
These serial number adoption applications came before for what was anticipated as a final hearing on 6th�January�2014.  LN attended that hearing, having already then consulted with solicitors.  She indicated her intention to apply for permission to oppose the adoption applications.  I therefore adjourned the application to today's date, 20th�February 2014, giving directions as to the documentation which needed to be filed for the hearing of the application for permission to oppose.  

 
In accordance with those directions I now have the full bundles from the two sets of care proceedings in respect of the children.  The first set of proceedings, in relation to M, was concluded by the making of final care and placement orders on 4th�December�2012.  The proceedings in respect of H commenced shortly after his birth and concluded with the making of final care and placement orders on 11th�June�2013.  

 
In addition to that, in accordance with the directions that I gave, I have received a supplementary bundle which includes the basis upon which the court determined threshold in each set of proceedings and the findings of the lay magistrates at the conclusion of the proceedings.  A statement has been filed by LN and, in addition to that, she has prepared a detailed typed letter for me which is appended to her statement in which she sets out a number of the matters that she wishes to draw to the court's attention.

 
The Local Authority has, in accordance with the directions that I gave, filed a statement in reply from the social worker, Jayne Storey.  She has also prepared a chronology of events which the Local Authority relies upon since the proceedings in respect of H concluded, now eight months ago.  I received a skeleton argument on behalf of LN and written submissions from the local authority.  

 
In addition to those documents, an application has been issued on behalf of LM under part 25 of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 for permission to instruct an expert.  Ms�Hargreaves, representing M, invited me to consider that application either as part of the leave application, or in the event that leave is granted.  I made it clear to her that I would not see it as appropriate at this stage of the proceedings to embark on the instruction of an expert.  If I considered that to be appropriate it would, in my judgment, be a compelling reason to give permission to oppose the adoption application to allow those matters to be explored.  She did not demur from that course. I will therefore refer to that application in due course.

 
The boys each have different fathers.  M's father is AR, who has parental responsibility for him, but did not play any significant part in his life, nor was he part of the proceedings which related to M.  Indeed, he has at times disputed paternity.  He was served with notice of these proceedings and the hearings.  He has not attended any of the hearings, nor has he responded to the proceedings in any other way.  H's father is MN.  He does not have parental responsibility for H.  He too was notified of the adoption application in respect of H, but has taken no steps to engage in these proceedings.

 
LN's mother, SW, has attended both the hearings which have taken place before me.  She was present on the last occasion to support her daughter.  I was asked by Ms�Hargreaves today to agree to SW accompanying her daughter in court to provide emotional and moral support to her daughter and also because SW wished to address the court.  I agreed to her being present on both bases.

 
The background to the two sets of care proceedings can be set out in brief.  Following M's birth he lived in the care of his mother until shortly before his 4th birthday.  He was accommodated and placed in foster care on 16th�May�2012, following which the Local Authority issued care proceedings.  The care proceedings included a parenting assessment by the Local Authority together with an expert assessment by Estelle�Louw (consultant clinical psychologist) who assessed LN and M.  The assessments did not support M's continuing placement with his mother or indeed within the birth family.  It was in these circumstances that the care proceedings in respect of M came before the Family Proceedings Court for final hearing.

 
The Local Authority's care plan for M was for his placement for adoption with indirect contact between M and his birth family.  The Local Authority had issued a placement application which it invited the court to determine at the conclusion of the proceedings.  The Guardian in both sets of care proceedings was Sheila Howey.  She supported the Local Authority's plan for M.  At the conclusion of a contested final hearing, the magistrates approved the findings sought by the Local Authority in relation to both threshold and welfare issues.  These findings are at B48 in the supplementary bundle prepared for today's hearing and their reasons are set out at B36.

 
The threshold findings in respect of M related to his exposure to the abusive relationship that M had with AR and the circumstances of her relationship with M�N, her dishonesty with professionals, poor home conditions and findings of neglect in relation to M's care whilst living with his mother (a failure to attend nursery and health appointments, amongst other aspects of his care).  The magistrates' reasons set out their acceptance of the evidence of the Local Authority, of Estelle�Louw and of the Children's Guardian in their analysis of the prospects of M's successful placement with his mother.  In their reasons at B37 they set out some extracts from Estelle�Louw's report which addressed the shortcomings that she found there to be in MN's parenting of M and the impact that that has had upon M.

 
The magistrates' reasons record that Estelle�Louw gave oral evidence that she was not optimistic that MN would effect the necessary changes to be in a position to parent successfully.  Her opinion was that it would take upwards of a year of constructive work to achieve the necessary change.  Estelle�Louw's view was that, as a result of his early life experiences, M required better than good enough parenting, a view with which the magistrates agreed.  

 
When SW addressed the court, it was clear that she what she said were inaccuracies in the parenting assessment of LN insofar as it relates to her family and circumstances.  I listened to some aspects of the shortcomings that she wished to outline and then made it clear to her that the court is to look at this stage at the changes which had been made since the placement orders in each case were made.  The court is bound by the findings of the Family Proceedings Court in circumstances in which they have not been successfully challenged.  I therefore propose to go no further into the matters that she raised, other than to say that they were not central in any way to the conclusions which were reached in the parenting assessment, nor to the magistrates' findings.

 
Having made final orders in respect of M on 4th�December�2012, H was born the following month.  H was accommodated and care proceedings were issued.  Those care proceedings proceeded to a final hearing in 11th�June�2013.  Once again, LN put forward her case for her son's placement in her care.  The magistrates gave their decision and reasons on 11th�June�2013.  In the reasons in respect of H (at B54), the magistrates address the question of change since the conclusion of the care proceedings in respect of M, six months earlier.

 
It is clear from their reasons (at B55) that they did accept that some changes had taken place.  They accepted that MN had attended courses and was due to start another course.  Although they recorded that MN was able to say what the differences between courses were and what she hoped to learn from each, the magistrates' reasons record that she had not made sufficiently significant changes and they questioned whether she really grasps the information and understands it so that she can retain it and put it into practice in the future.  As they recorded, simply attending these courses is insufficient to demonstrate the required change.

 
The findings record the conclusion of the court that there was continuing and recent evidence at that stage that LN was unable to work with the Local Authority.  They found that she had lied in the course of the proceedings, which they concluded demonstrated not only deceit but, in the context of those lies, her inability to take appropriate decisions in the best interests of her children.  At the time of the issues resolution hearing in respect of H, MN had disclosed that she may once again be pregnant from what was said to have been a one-off encounter.  The court concluded that there was a lack of change in her circumstances in relation to her relationships and the court did not rule out, on her evidence, that she would have other such encounters.

 
The Family Proceedings Court recorded and accepted the evidence of H's Guardian, Sheila Howey, of the significant shortcomings in LN's basic parenting abilities.  At B58 the magistrates found that there was a deficiency in understanding and carrying out the basic tasks of parenting in seeing to H's needs.  Having addressed the welfare issues and approving the threshold findings that were in issue, the court went on to make final care and placement orders in respect of H.  In the case of each of the children, when placement orders were made, parental consent was dispenses with in accordance with section 52 Adoption and Children Act 2002.  

 
At the time of the final hearing in relation to H, the court was aware that an adoptive placement had been identified for the two boys if final orders were made.  In the light of the final orders in respect of both children, the matching process proceeded and they were duly placed together with their prospective adopters on 15th July�2013, now seven months ago.

 
The statements prepared for this hearing highlighted to me for the first time that there had been a further application since the conclusion of the care proceedings in respect of H.  Further enquiry today has revealed that MN applied in person to the Family Proceedings Court for revocation of the placement orders.  Her application came before District�Judge�Elsey in December 2013.  It proceeded no further, in circumstances in which the children were already placed.  It is in these circumstances that the applications for permission to oppose come before the court.

 
The written submissions on behalf of LN and the Local Authority make it clear that there is no dispute between them as to the relevant legal framework in the light of the decision of Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  The magistrates made placement orders in respect of both M and H, pursuant to section 26 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, dispensing with parental consent, as I have recorded.  

 
Section 47 of the Act sets out the conditions for making an adoption order.  The relevant parts are as follows:

 
(1)	An adoption order may not be made if the child has a parent or guardian unless one of the following three conditions is met; but this section is subject to section 52�
(4)	The second condition is that:
(a)	the child has been placed for adoption by an adoption agency with the prospective adopters in whose favour the order is proposed to be made, and
(b)(ii)	the child was placed for adoption under a placement order; and
(c)	no parent or guardian opposes the making of an adoption order.
(5)	A parent or guardian may not oppose the making of an adoption order under the second condition without the court's leave.
(7)	The court cannot give leave unless satisfied that there has been a change in circumstances since the placement order was made.
I make it clear that, in the application of these principles, I have taken account of the following.  The Article 8 rights for respect for private and family life that are very clearly engaged - there can be no clearer situation where that is the case.  The order proposed is one of adoption, altering the legal relationships that the child or children have with their birth family, so that they are terminated.  Such orders can only be made where it is both necessary and proportionate.  In Re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria) [2013] UKSC 33, the Supreme Court stressed that orders contemplating non-consensual adoption are very extreme orders of last resort, to be made in exceptional circumstances where nothing else will do - where no other course is possible in the child's interests.  I approach these decisions on the basis that the least interventionist approach should be taken, unless there are cogent and compelling reasons to the contrary.  

 
In accordance with Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, the court is to undertake a global, holistic and multifaceted evaluation of the child's welfare, taking account of all negatives and positives of the options in the question.  The recent authorities confirm that 47(5) Adoption and Children Act 2002 is intended to provide a real and meaningful remedy in appropriate cases.

 
The application under section 47(5) is to be considered in two stages.  First, whether there has been a change in circumstances and, second, if so, should leave to oppose be given.  The first question, whether there has been a relevant change in circumstances, was considered by the Court of Appeal in Re P (Adoption: Leave Provisions) [2007] EWCA Civ 616, where it was held that the change of circumstances since the placement order was made must be of a nature and degree sufficient on the facts of the particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion to defend the adoption proceedings.  Whether or not there has been a relevant change in circumstances is a matter of fact to be decided by the good sense and sound judgment of the tribunal that are hearing the application.  

 
The second question (if there has been a change in circumstances, whether leave should be given) was addressed in detail in the judgment of the President in Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  At paragraph 74, he said the court needs to consider all the circumstances, in particular two interrelated questions:

 
i)	The parent's ultimate prospects of success if leave is given; and
ii)	The impact on the child if the parent is or is not given leave to oppose, remembering that the child's welfare is paramount at that stage.
I pause to record that the welfare consideration is in accordance with section 1 Adoption and Children Act 2002 so that the child's welfare throughout his life is the court's paramount consideration.  The extended welfare checklist in section 1(4) is to be applied, requiring the court to consider (among other factors): the impact on the child of ceasing to be a member of the birth family and becoming an adopted person; the relationship the child has with the birth family, including the likelihood of the relationship continuing and the value of it doing so; the ability and willingness of the birth family to meet the child's needs and the wishes and feelings of the birth family.  

 
The President set out in Re B-S ten factors which are relevant to the weighing and balancing of the considerations in any case:

 
i)	The prospect of success of resisting the adoption, not ultimately having the child restored to the parent's care.
The mother's case is that that this is her ultimate goal.  The court must nonetheless consider this application on the basis of the prospect of successfully resisting the adoption.
ii)	The two questions (the change of circumstances and welfare) are almost invariably intertwined.
iii)	Once a change of circumstances is established and solid grounds for seeking leave, the judge must consider very carefully indeed whether the child's welfare really does necessitate the refusal of leave, remembering that adoption is the last resort and that the child's interests include being brought up within his or her birth family.
iv)	The welfare evaluation must take into consideration the pros and cons' a balance sheet analysis is encouraged.
v)	A close focus on the circumstances requires evidence.
The President considered that, typically, the hearing would be dealt with on the submissions, as I have done.  I made it clear during the course of submissions that, insofar as there are disputed issues of fact, it is not possible for those to be resolved in the context of this hearing.  There were, in the event, no factual issues which I considered central to the issues for my determination.
vi)	As a general proposition, the greater the positive change and the more solid the parent's grounds for seeking leave to oppose, the more cogent or compelling the arguments against based on welfare must be if leave is to be refused.
vii)	The mere fact that the child is placed with prospective adopters is not determinative, nor is the passage of time.  The older the child and the longer in placement, the greater the adverse impacts of disturbing the arrangement are likely to be.
viii)	The child's welfare throughout his or her life is paramount, looking into adulthood and old age.  The court must not attach undue weight to the short-term consequence if leave is given but must take a medium and long-term view of the child's welfare.
ix)	The court must take care not to attach too much weight to the adverse impact on prospective adopters and, in consequence, on the child or children; and
x)	Importantly, the test should not be set too high.
The court must consider therefore whether the parent, the mother in this case, has demonstrated the necessary changes and solidity in her prospects of successfully opposing the adoption.  The evidence and the submissions provided for this hearing have properly addressed the changes which are relied upon by LN in seeking permission to oppose the adoption applications and also address the welfare issues.  The changes that she relies upon are summarised by Mrs�Hargreaves on her behalf under a number of headings.  

 
The first is the position in relation to her relationships.  It is argued on her behalf that she has not embarked on any other relationship since the proceedings in relation to H concluded, now eight months ago.  The Local Authority has had no direct involvement with her since the proceedings concluded, but there is no evidence to suggest that she has had any other relationship since the relationship which gave rise to the suspected pregnancy at around the time of the conclusion of the proceedings in June�2013.  LM also accepted in the earlier proceedings that her relationship choices had been bad.  There is evidence as recently as June�2013 that she had unprotected sex so that she believed that she may be pregnant.  I accept that there is no evidence of any relationship appropriate or otherwise in the last eight months, however, that must be seen in context.  It is, in my judgment, a short period which cannot be relied upon to provide any real foundation for the manner in which her future life will be determined.

 
I fully accept the submission which was made by Ms�Hargreaves that M could not prove more because of the limited time that has passed since the final order was made in relation to H.  It is, in my judgment, nonetheless a short period against the background of a history of inappropriate and abusive relationships, despite the work which had been undertaken by MN previously to understand the nature of those relationships through her attendance at at least part of the Freedom Programme.  

 
The second change relied upon relates to MN's attendance at parenting and other courses.  At the outset of the hearing, Ms�Hargreaves conceded that one aspect of the case put forward on behalf of MN is inaccurate.  The parenting course which is referred to as having taken place after proceedings in relation to H concluded, in fact, took place after the proceedings in relation to M.  MN is once again undertaking sessions as part of the Solihull parenting course.  That was a course that she had attended substantially before the proceedings concluded in respect of H.  I accept that she may well have been unable to attend one of those sessions as a result of a commitment she had with her solicitor to prepare her statement for this hearing but, on the evidence that I have, she has attended two sessions of that course.  This is a course which addresses basic parenting issues.

 
Mrs�Hargreaves also argues that MN has made approaches to outreach services herself to see what further steps can be taken.  The Family Proceedings Court concluded quite properly that the fact of attendance is not sufficient.  As Estelle�Louw said when she gave evidence in December�2012, significant work would be required by MN to put her in a position where she could safely parent a child.  Although she identified a time of 12 months or more for that work to be undertaken, the passage of time itself would not achieve the change without the successful completion of the significant work which was identified as necessary to address her shortcomings in parenting.

 
The changes which have been made since the proceedings concluded in respect of M were, of course, the subject of consideration in the proceedings which related to H.  The court concluded that the changes which had been made, and the work that was being undertaken, was clearly well-intentioned and MN's efforts were recognised.  The court considered, however, these to fall far short of what was required to demonstrate an ability to parent a child, in the light of the overall evidence before the court.  Limited work has been undertaken since that time.  

 
Mrs�Hargreaves also relies on the improved home conditions.  That was an issue, certainly, in the proceedings relating to M.  It was not an issue relied upon in the proceedings relating to H and the Local Authority does now not raise any issue of home conditions but argues that it is not a change since the proceedings in relation to H concluded.

 
The area in which there is some dispute on the facts relates to the case put on behalf of MN, that she is now able to work openly with the Local Authority and other professionals, in circumstances in which she accepts that she has not previously and the court has found that she has not previously.  The Local Authority challenges this in the evidence that it has filed, arguing that there have been occasions where MN has continued to mislead and misrepresent situations in a way which has undermined a trusting relationship.  As I have made clear in the course of the submissions with both advocates, I am not in a position to determine those issues.

 
As I would always do at this stage, I adopt the most positive approach for the parent seeking permission to oppose: if I considered there were proper circumstances in which those matters could affect my determination, I would explore them further.  It is also argued that MN accepts the Local Authority's and professionals' concerns.  That is something which is recorded in the magistrates' reasons from the earlier hearings.  

 
Those are in summary the changes which are relied upon.  I have to consider whether those are of a nature and extent to open the door to reconsideration of the issues in relation to these boys and their future placement and to an evaluation of the welfare considerations.  I accept that there is some evidence of change.  Mrs�W, on behalf of her daughter, also gave support to that in saying that she has seen a very great change which she says is not seen by professionals.  She said she sees that on day by day basis.

 
I have dealt with each of the headings of change which are relied upon.  Such changes as have been established, in my judgment, fall far short of the necessary change which would be required to persuade the court that the issue of these boys' future should properly be reopened.  In my judgment, the changes that have been established fall far short of the significant changes required to address the extensive shortcomings which were identified in the earlier care proceedings and reflected in the decisions of the court.  In my judgment, MN, although I fully accept loving her children very much and wishing to provide the best for them, has not demonstrated the necessary changes or solidity in her prospects of successfully opposing the adoption.

 
Despite having reached that conclusion, I will nonetheless address in brief my evaluation of the welfare considerations, for the sake of completeness.  As the President indicated in Re B-S, the two issues are intertwined.  Where there is a significant change established it would require compelling reasons for the court to reach a welfare decision which would prevent further investigation of the issue.  I have identified that the changes made in this case are not of a significant nature to provide a solid basis for seeking leave.

 
I look then to the welfare considerations.  M is a young boy who is now over 5�.  He has been living away from his family since he was not quite four years old, although he has only been in his adoptive placement (together with his younger brother) for seven months.  He suffered significant harm as a result of the care he received from his mother.  The Local Authority's evidence is that he is showing signs of the neglect that he experienced in his own life, in things he has said to his prospective adopters about the experiences he had when he was living with his mother.  He is a child who the court accepted requires better than good enough parenting as a result of these early experiences.  H has never lived with his birth family.  He was in foster care and then placed for adoption.  He has not suffered harm in the same way as his older brother.

 
Both of these boys require permanence and stability.  They need to be part of a family which can provide for them not only consistently throughout their childhood, but throughout their lives.  Taking account of their ages and circumstances, if they cannot live with their birth family, a placement for adoption provides by far the best prospect of this permanence and stability.  

 
Although M has a memory of life with his birth family, the evidence indicates that these memories are not positive.  The court concluded at each final hearing that the boys' mother could not provide them with the care they each required.  The proceedings in relation to H concluded only eight months ago, since when I have concluded that the changes to her life are neither or a nature or extent to alter the conclusions reached by the magistrates.  

 
M and H are both thriving in their adoptive placement.  I give only limited weight to the impact on the prospective adopters (and therefore on the children) of any continuation of these proceedings.  I have, however, concluded that there is no realistic prospect of a court considering their placement with their mother.  Any delay in the adoption proceedings would not, in these circumstances, result in the prospect of a return to her care and would simply result in continuing uncertainty.  

 
I have concluded that the positive changes do not make out any solid basis for permission to oppose.  I have also concluded that the welfare considerations for these boys are overwhelmingly against any further delay in the adoption application.  I therefore have concluded that the application for permission to oppose in each case is refused.

JUDGMENT

THE JUDGE:  This is an application by KQ for permission to oppose the adoption application in respect of SW (S), who was born on 22nd August 2008 and so is now 5 years and 5 months of age.

 
The adoption application was first listed for a final hearing before His Honour Judge Wood on 9th January 2014.  KQ attended that hearing and indicated her intention to oppose.  His Honour Judge Wood gave directions for KQ to file a statement, with a statement in response from the social worker, and re-listed the case before me for determination of the application for permission to oppose the adoption on 6th February 2014 as I had been the trial judge who had made orders in the care and placement proceedings in relation to S and her older siblings.

 
KQ filed a statement as directed.  She had solicitors at the time, who assisted her in doing so.  A statement was then filed from the social worker, Mark Gribbin, who was also the social worker for the children at the time of the final hearing in the care proceedings.  In the event, KQ was not represented at the hearing before me on 6th February 2014.  She did not have legal aid available and had decided the cost was too great.

 
The statement filed by KQ sets out the changes she relies upon.  The social worker acknowledges that she has made some changes, but puts them in the context of information which he had received from other sources.  I was able to explore these with KQ, who essentially agreed that the social work statement was accurate in what it reported about these issues.  The hearing proceeded on submissions, with KQ taking the oath at the outset of the proceedings.  I heard this case in the middle of a part heard case before me.  For convenience and to avoid delay in both cases, I determined that I would give judgment today, 7th�February 2014.

 
I can deal with the background to the application as follows.  KQ is now 33 years of age.  She has been assessed as having a mild learning disability.  She has had a history of mental health difficulties, mild depression and also a longstanding eating disorder.

 
S is the fourth of now five children of KQ.  The eldest, R, was 15 yesterday.  He has had complex special care needs since his birth.  He has a severe learning disability, epilepsy and communication difficulties.  S is the youngest of the three children of the relationship between KQ and EM.  The two older children are JW (now aged 8) and GW (now aged 6).  The children were in their mother's care until 7th August 2009.  At that time S was not quite 12 months of age.  They were placed in local authority foster care at that stage, initially subject to an emergency protection order, following which care proceedings were issued.  S was placed with local authority foster carers who are in fact her prospective adopters.  The circumstances which gave rise to the children's removal arose out of issues relating to domestic abuse and alcohol misuse, together with concerns relating to KQ's mental health.

 
A final hearing was listed before Her Honour Judge Moir in September 2010.  The local authority plan at that stage was placement away from the birth family.  During the course of the hearing the court heard psychiatric evidence in relation to KQ (or KW as she was then), as to the therapeutic work which could be undertaken with her and the prospect that she may then be able to provide care for her children.

 
The case was unable to conclude due to insufficient court time and it was evident that there was going to be a period of adjournment.  As a result of that, the work which had been recommended was embarked upon and led, in due course, to a plan of rehabilitation of J, G and S.

 
In July 2011 J, G and S returned to their mother's care.  At that stage S was approaching her third birthday.  There was a considerable support package made available in terms of social worker/family support worker involvement, psychological support, involvement of a community psychiatric nurse in relation to KQ's mental health difficulties and her eating disorder, provision of nursery care, health visitor involvement and after-school child care.  Within a short time there were evident difficulties.  KQ was not taking her medication in relation to her depression and ceased her engagement with the psychological support.  She was not cooperating or engaging with the family support worker and care of the children was noted to deteriorate.  There was evidence of continuing association with EM and a series of incidents between them.  During one such episode KQ sustained injuries and the second, which precipitated the children's return to foster care, arose from behaviour on her part in which she threatened to kill him with a hammer and caused damage to his property.

 
It was against that background that the children returned to foster care on 4th�November 2011.  S was fortunate to be able to return to the previous foster carers (now the prospective adopters).  She was then just 3 years and 2 months of age.

 
The case then came before me for final hearing in January 2012.  I gave judgment on 5th January 2012.  I approved findings in relation to the threshold criteria.  I made final care and placement orders in respect of J, G and S (a care order had been made in 2011 in relation to Robert).  I have taken the opportunity to review my record of the judgment I gave on 5th�January�2012, both before hearing this case yesterday and before giving judgment today.

 
Contact between KQ and S ended in December 2012 when S was aged 4.  Following S's return to foster care, and once her foster carers learned the local authority plan had reverted to a plan of adoption, they indicated a wish to adopt her.  They were approved as prospective adopters for S on 15th May 2013.  It is evident from the chronology that I have given that S (now aged almost five and a half) has lived with the prospective adopters from the age of almost 12 months, apart from a period of four months during the attempted rehabilitation to her mother's care.

 
KQ has identified the following changes to her circumstances.  Her statement records that she met AQ, who is now her husband, in January 2012.  During the course of representations yesterday she told me that he is significantly older than her, now in his 50s.  He is in employment and a stable family home.  KQ's statement records that her last contact with EM was in March�2012.  She and AQ married in July 2012.  She became pregnant in 2013 and on 13th�October 2013 her youngest child, SQ, was born.  SQ is now coming up to 4 months of age.

 
There was local authority involvement before SQ's birth.  The involvement of the local authority led to a child protection plan being put in place in respect of SQ.  She remains in her parents' care, with the continuing involvement of social care through a social worker (now Elaine Taylor) and family support worker.

 
In her statement, KQ sets out the following other areas of progress.  She is no longer taking antidepressants as she was previously and she describes herself as recovering from her eating disorder and gaining weight.  She made it clear both in her statement and in the representations that she made before me that she wants S to return to her care and that she would, if successful in that, also seek to oppose adoption applications in respect of J and G which are currently underway in circumstances in which they, too, have been placed for adoption now for some time.

 
The statement of Mark Gribbin includes information provided to him by Elaine�Taylor, SQ's social worker.  That includes details of the difficulties between KQ and AQ over the Christmas period, as a result of which AQ threatened to leave.  When KQ was first asked about it she is recorded as giving inconsistent accounts, although she accepted ultimately that the information that the local authority had received in relation to this was true.  During the course of the hearing yesterday I asked her about this, to ascertain the extent to which there were factual disputes.  She agreed that what is recorded did in fact happen.  She went on to say that she had told AQ to leave but he had not done so.

 
The social worker's statement also records that in January 2014 KQ consulted with her General Practitioner in relation to her eating disorder, asking for further support in relation to it and told the General Practitioner that she was concerned that her relationship would end as a result of these difficulties.  Once again, KQ confirmed during the course of the hearing yesterday that that was the position.

 
Against this background I turn to the legal framework.  On 5th January 2012 I made a placement order in respect of S pursuant to section 26 Adoption and Children Act 2002.  KQ's consent was dispensed with in accordance with section 52, in circumstances in which EM does not have parental responsibility for S (he is not named on the birth certificate and he has not otherwise acquired parental responsibility).

 
Section 47 Adoption and Children Act 2002 sets out the conditions for making an adoption order.  The relevant parts are as follows:

 

(1)	An adoption order may not be made if a child has a parent or guardian unless one of the following three conditions is met � subject to section 52 (parental etc. consent).
(4)	The second condition is that:
(a)	The child has been placed by an adoption agency with the prospective adopter in whose favour the adoption order is proposed to be made;
(b)	Either
	�
	(ii)	The child was placed for adoption under a placement order, and
(c)	No parent or guardian opposes the making of the adoption order.
(5)	The parent or guardian may not oppose the making of an adoption order under the second condition without the court's leave.
(7)	The court cannot give leave under (5) unless satisfied that there has been a change in circumstances since � the placement order was made.
In the application of these provisions I have taken account of the following principles.  Article 8 right to respect for a private and family life are clearly engaged.  There can be no clearer situation where that is the case.  The order proposed is one of adoption, altering the legal relationships for S so that her legal relationships with her birth family are terminated.  Such an order can only be made where it is both necessary and proportionate.  

 
Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption are very extreme orders of last resort, to be made in exceptional circumstances where nothing else will do and where no other course is possible in the child's interests: In Re: B (A Child) Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria [2013] UKSC 33.  I approach this decision on the basis that the less interventionist approach rather than more should be taken unless there are cogent and compelling reasons to the contrary.  

 
In accordance with Re: G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, the court should undertake a global holistic and multi-faceted evaluation of the child's welfare, taking account of all negatives and positives of the options in question.  Section 47(5) Adoption and Children Act 2002 is intended to provide a real meaningful remedy in appropriate cases.

 
An application pursuant section 47(5) is considered in two stages: firstly, has there been a change in circumstances; and, secondly, if so should leave to oppose be given.  The first question - whether there has been a relevant change in circumstances - was considered in Re: P (Adoption: Leave Provisions) [2007] EWCA Civ 616 where Lord Justice Wall said:  

 

'The change of circumstances since the placement order was made must be of a nature and degree sufficient on the facts of the particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion to defend the adoption proceedings'.  

Whether or not there has been a relevant change in circumstances is a matter of fact to be decided by good sense and sound judgment of the tribunal hearing the application.  
The second question - if there has been a change in circumstances, whether leave should be given - was addressed in detail in the judgment of the President in Re: B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  At paragraph 74 he said the court needs to consider all the circumstances, in particular two interrelated questions.  First, the parent's ultimate prospect of success if leave is given; and, second, the impact on the child if the parent is, or is not, given leave to oppose, remembering that the child's welfare is paramount at this stage.

 
I pause to record that the welfare consideration is in accordance with section 1 Adoption and Children Act 2002 so that the child's welfare throughout his or her life is the court's paramount consideration.  The extended welfare checklist in section 1(4) of the 2002 Act must be applied, requiring the court to consider, among other factors, the impact on the child of ceasing to be a member of the birth family and becoming an adopted person and the relationship the child has with the birth family, including the likelihood of the relationship continuing and the value of it doing so, the ability and willingness of the birth family to meet the child's needs and the wishes and feelings of the birth family.

 
The President set out ten factors relevant to the weighing in the balance of the considerations in any case.

 

(1)	The prospect of success relates to resisting the adoption and not ultimately having the child restored to the parent's care.  
(2)	The two questions, the change of circumstances and welfare assessment, are almost invariably intertwined.  
(3)	Once change is established and solid grounds for seeking leave the judge must consider very carefully indeed whether the child's welfare really does necessitate the refusal of leave, remembering that adoption is a last resort and the child's interests include being brought up within his or her family.
(4)	The welfare evaluation must take into consideration the pros and cons � a balance sheet analysis is encouraged.  
(5)	A close focus on the circumstances requires evidence.  Typically, as in this case, the hearing will be dealt with on submissions.  
(6)	As a general proposition, the greater the positive change and the more solid the parent's grounds for seeking leave to oppose, the more cogent or compelling the arguments against based on welfare must be if leave is to be refused.  
(7)	The fact that the child is placed with prospective adopters is not determinative, nor is the passage of time.  The older the child and the longer in placement the greater the adverse impact of disturbing the arrangements are likely to be.
(8)	The child's welfare throughout his or her life is paramount, looking into adulthood and old age.  The court must not attach undue weight to the short term consequences if leave is given, but must take a medium and long term view of the child's welfare.  
(9)	Care must be taken not to attach too much weight to the adverse impact on the prospective adopters and, in consequence, on the child.  
(10)	The test should not be set too high.  

The President described the analysis as considering whether the parent has what he described as 'solid grounds' for seeking leave.
In addition to Re: B-S Mr O'Sullivan, who represented the local authority at the hearing before me, made reference to two further authorities: Re: L (Leave to Oppose Making of Adoption Order) [2013] EWCA Civ 1481 and Re: D (Leave to Oppose Making of Adoption Order) [2013] EWCA Civ 1480.  I have taken those references from the copy authorities provided to me, but � in the light of the pagination recorded above - it may well be that one or other of the citations is incorrect.

 
Re: L (Leave to Oppose Making an Adoption Order) [2013] EWCA Civ 1481 turns very much on its facts.  Lady Justice Black nonetheless made some observations of general application at paragraph 58.  She considered the position where a child has been placed with adopters for a protracted period, is well settled and remembers nothing else.  The court may well take the view that there has to be a degree of confidence about the birth parent's ability to provide a home before it can even contemplate assessing the parent's prospects as solid.  Re: D (Leave to Oppose Making an Adoption Order) [2013] EWCA Civ 1480 provided a further consideration of the application of these relevant principles.

 
I return to the facts of this case.  My description of events leading to the care and placement orders being made makes it clear that KQ's circumstances have changed.  She is in a new relationship which is now of two years' duration.  There is a child of that relationship who is cared for by her parents.  But the picture is not entirely straightforward in my judgment.  There is recent evidence of strain in the relationship and evidence of continuing difficulties in relation to eating on the part of KQ.  There are, in my judgment, changes in KQ's circumstances which are materially relevant and, in the main, positive.  Her circumstances are certainly better than when the final orders were made in the earlier proceedings.  The solidity of her grounds for seeking leave is tempered by these factors.  I am, however, satisfied that the first limb of the test should be considered to be met in the circumstances of this case so that the welfare analysis is undertaken.

 
I turn then to the welfare analysis.  I have reminded myself of the relevant factors identified by the President in Re: B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  In the present case the changes are generally positive.  There are, however, significant questions on KQ's own account about the current stability of the relationship and the extent to which her eating disorder is a current issue.  I have already indicated my conclusion that the changes are sufficient to warrant consideration of the second stage welfare analysis, but I am cautious about the extent of the change in these circumstances.

 
KQ stated her case frankly, both in her statement and her submissions.  She made it clear that she does not think that she does have much of a chance of successfully opposing this application, but she said she needs to feel she has done everything she could to do so.  

 
Before I go any further I make it clear that I do not doubt her love for S and her wish to care for S and, indeed, for S's siblings, J and G.  KQ spoke during the course of the hearing of her guilt at Christmas 2013 as, despite her pleasure of having SQ at home, her older four children were not at home with her.  I also accept that KQ would do her very best to provide for S if she were given the opportunity to do so.

 
Against that background, I look at the prospects of success.  S is now almost 5� years of age.  She has lived with her prospective adopters since she was 12 months old, apart from the four month failed rehabilitation more than two years ago.  She has had no contact with her birth mother for more than a year.  She is described as extremely settled in what she has known as her home for years.  The impact of any disturbance of these arrangements would be very considerable for S in these circumstances.  There is every indication that it is a highly successful placement with carers who are fully committed to S.  

 
The disadvantage to S should this application be refused is she will lose the opportunity to be cared for or have any significant ongoing relationship with her birth mother and therefore her extended family, including her younger half-sibling, SQ.

 
If leave to oppose is granted KQ has made it clear that it is her intention to seek S's return to her care.  Apart from the huge disruption in removing S from the home that she has known for four out of the five years of her life, there are very significant questions in my judgment about the ability of KQ to care for another child even in her improved circumstances.  The evidence - accepted by her - of recent events demonstrates that her current relationship is under some strain and the issues identified include a potential recurrence of her long term eating disorder.

 
The advantage to S if permission to oppose were granted and there was successful opposition to the adoption application would be the potential of a continuing relationship with her birth family, either through placement or contact with her.  The option of long term foster care is not, in my judgment, an attractive course for S, who is a very young child who needs permanence and security throughout her life.

 
I have considered the impact on the prospective adopters of permission to oppose being allowed.  They are professional foster carers.  I have no doubt they are anxious about the current circumstances.  As the President said in Re: B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, this aspect is not to be given too great an emphasis and I do not do so.  I remind myself that the test for a parent is not to be set too high and that adoption is a last resort and should only be contemplated if nothing else will do.

 
S is, however, completely settled in the only home she has known.  She is now five years old and very aware of her situation.  She is already part of the family, but her prospective adopters wish to parent her throughout her life, with the legal security for S that adoption would bring.  That is, in my judgment, a significant advantage to S.  

 
In my evaluation of the competing arguments I have considered S's welfare throughout her life as my paramount consideration and I have had full regard to the welfare checklist in section 1(4) of the Act.  For the reasons that I have given during the course of my judgment I have reached the conclusion that, despite the changes that KQ has made, her prospects of successfully opposing S's adoption are minimal.  In the words of the President, they do not have solidity.

 
Moreover, the welfare arguments in this case are, in my judgment, compelling.  They argue clearly and strongly against granting permission to oppose.  This is, in my judgment, one of those cases contemplated by Lady Justice Black in Re: L, where S's circumstances argue very strongly against allowing the application to proceed.  I therefore refuse the application for permission to oppose.

HHJ MIFFLIN: 
The child in this case A, has been the subject of proceedings during virtually all her life. She is now 2 years old having been born in 2011. This Court had a number of substantive hearings before making final orders in July 2013. All three previous judgments of this Court have been transcribed and so repetition in unnecessary.

 

Subsequent to the final Orders the mother appealed supported by the Local Authority. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on 11th October 2013 and remitted the case back to this Court for the Court to give further consideration of what Order, if any was proportionate, see [2013] EWCA Civ 1227. There was substantial criticism of the Local Authority's failure to provide the Court with an adequate care plan. The Court of Appeal reinforced the duties of a Local Authority to a Court, many of which had been largely ignored by this Local Authority. Those that had been complied with amounted to no more than window dressing in my judgment.

 

The Court's findings of fact and the formulation of the Threshold Criteria as found in the judgment dated 11th March 2013, survive the hearing in the Court of Appeal. This Court therefore does not have to revisit those findings. In addition there was no challenge to the Court's analysis of risk based upon those findings. These matters therefore are the starting point for the welfare analysis. 

 


The parties to this hearing are:

 
Neath and Port Talbot CBC represented by Mr Tolson QC
B (Mother) represented by Lorna Meyer QC
C (Father) represented by Sian Parry
Mr D and Mrs E (Paternal Grandparents) in person
A (Through her Children's Guardian Elin Elias) represented by Ruth Henke QC.

This hearing therefore has primarily focused on the issue of what Order, if any is necessary in light of the fact that it is almost a year after the last judgement of this Court. There is divergence in the position of the parties. The Local Authority, Father, paternal grandparents and Children's Guardian invite the Court to make a Care Order. The Mother suggests that no order is necessary but if the Court takes the view that the Local Authority should have a statutory order then she would accept a Supervision Order.

 

However, in addition to the welfare analysis, once again the Court has been asked by one or more party to consider making further findings of fact. These are in respect of a number of issues namely:

 
The actions of the mother around bruising sustained by A in July 2013;
The motivation behind Mother lying (accepted by her) to the Local Authority about whether a male friend, Mr Z, had spent a period of time (and overnight) at her home.
The reaction of Mother to a request by the paternal family that A attend her cousin's christening.

In addition, there has also been a side issue about the way in which contact between A and the paternal family should move on; in particular whether it is appropriate for there to be staying contact at the home of the Paternal Grandparents. 

 

The starting point it has to be remembered is the judgment of this Court handed down in March 2013. The Court made clear and detailed findings as to factual issues and also evaluated each party's credibility, the respective profiles of the family members and gave an analysis of the risk posed to A by her Mother. The Court found that A was at risk of significant harm from the possible actions of her mother. The risk was dynamic, unpredictable, likely to be longstanding in nature and emanated from Mother's psychological functioning. The Court also set out the reasons why at the time of the judgment it considered the imposition of a Care Order to be both a necessary and proportionate response to the identified risk of harm. That reasoning survives the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Accordingly the content of that judgment should be read in conjunction with this and the Court does not propose to repeat the same here. The Court therefore has to consider whether what has happened since that decision might affect or undermine the decision of the Court.

 

The events of the last year have to be seen in the context of the role adopted by the Local Authority immediately after the decision of the Court. It does them no credit in my judgment that in effect they made a decision to manage this case as if the Care Order had not been made. The message that was given to the Mother is quite clearly seen from the first contact with the Social Worker after the making of the Care Order [L249 Social Worker recording 3/4/13]. The Local Authority's refusal to accept the judgment was made clear in the documents filed by them leading up to the making of the final order. They continued to ignore the rulings of the Court that they should manage the risk under a Care Order and share parental responsibility. There were no LAC Reviews, no compliance with the Placement with Parent Regulations (PwP), and in fact at times no acknowledgement that it was a Care Order that they held. This led to a situation whereby there was no effective risk management. These acts and omissions were both arrogant and short sighted from a Local Authority who continued to lack insight into the complexities of the case. The justification given was that there had been an appeal lodged. There was no stay in place. It seems to this Court that a simple assertion that a decision of the Court of Appeal was awaited is not a credible explanation for the course of conduct and ignores the potential consequences of their actions for the child who after all, is the most important person. 

 

The effectiveness of the role of the Local Authority has been further undermined by the fact that since the making of the Care Order, A has had 4 different Social Workers. The Social Worker at the time of the making of the Care Order was heavily criticised in the Court's judgment. But it was the understanding of the Court that she would continue to manage the case as she had "a good working relationship" with B. It appears that the next two allocated Social Workers paid only lip service to the findings of this Court. Undoubtedly they were aware of the approach to this case that the Local Authority had taken, that the Local Authority did not accept the risk analysis of this Court. It is even if viewed in the most favourable light, poor social work practice that there was no attempt even to familiarise themselves with the Court's judgment. However, having heard the present Social Worker, this Court is satisfied that no similar criticism can or should be levied at her. She was an impressive witness who had taken time to analyse the dynamics of the case. This Court is satisfied that she has invested time in order to gain and understanding of this case. In addition she quickly gained experience of the pitfalls in having to work with the mother.

 

Prior to considering the welfare analysis, it is appropriate to deal with the findings sought by the parties (excluding the Mother). The first finding relates to Mother's behaviour around the time immediately after the discovery of bruising to A's leg in July 2013.

 

Bruising in July
The first point to make is that although the Local Authority have had concerns around two separate incidents of bruising to A, to the leg in July 2013 and an a bruise to her check in January 2014, sufficient to warrant a Child Protection Medical it is not part of the Local Authority's case that these were inflicted (accidentally or otherwise) by Mother or anyone else. The Local Authority's position has been clear throughout the hearing and repeated in final submissions. The Court will not and should not permit any suspicion to the contrary. The Local Authority and other parties have invited the Court to explore the Mother's actions around the enquiry that was put in place by the Local Authority in July as suggestive of Mother's failure to work in partnership with the Local Authority. 

 

The Court accepted the invitation to explore the circumstances in July 2013 as part of the overall picture and to assist the consideration of welfare issues. The important parts of the chronology are as follows.

 

On 25th June 2013 the Social Worker organised a planning meeting to encourage the family to agree a means by which contact for the paternal family could be progressed. The records show that was clearly a difficult meeting. This was confirmed by the Social Worker Mr Fraser during his evidence. No agreement was reached and relationships were fraught. The meeting was brought to an abrupt end when the Mother and Maternal Grandmother left the meeting indicating that they would be speaking to Mother's solicitor. Contact however would continue in accordance with the arrangements that were in place at that time.

 

As planned on 28th June, Father had contact with A between 3pm and 5pm. The child was returned to Mother. Nothing was said to indicate that there had been any issue during the contact period. The Court is not clear when Mother first saw a linear bruise to the child's leg. It was sometime between the 2nd and 4th July. What is clear is that on any account it was a number of days after the contact.  The bruise was sufficiently significant to warrant Mother not only taking a photograph of it but sending the photograph by email to her solicitor, asking for advice. She told the Court in evidence that she spoke to both her mother and father as each had had contact with Ain the days after contact with Father but before the bruise was noticed. At no point did Mother take steps to notify Social Services. Nor it seems was she advised to do so by her parents. In fact Mother spoke to the Social Worker on the telephone on 3rd July but made no mention of the bruise. The Social Worker visited the home on 4th July and, if the Social Worker's note (and recollection) is correct Mother pointed out the bruise to him but not until the end of a visit lasting over an hour. Mother indicated to the Social Worker that she had tried to make a GP appointment that morning but no appointments were available. Despite telephoning the GP she made no attempt even at that stage to contact the Social Worker.  

 

However, in the conversation that she had with the Social Worker Mother says that she thought that the bruise had occurred in contact with the paternal family on 28th June. B reinforces her position that the bruises occurred whilst with the paternal family by suggesting that A often returns from contact with bruises. It is accepted that Mother had not previously raised this as an issue with the Local Authority. Surprisingly Mother suggests that she had not noticed the bruising until 2nd July, some 5 days later. During the course of this conversation, Mother makes no mention of the Maternal Grandparents having had contact during the period or of having any discussion with them as to causation of the bruise. This conversation must be seen in the context of Mother having had time to reflect upon her position. This was a planned visit to her home. She had had discussions with her own parents and had had the opportunity of discussing matters with her solicitor. 

 

It causes the Court some concern that the Social Worker having seen the bruise advised the Mother that she should take responsibility for arranging an appointment for A with the GP the following day. That is an unacceptable way to deal with a clear child protection concern. The Social Worker, Mr Fraser, seemed surprised that anyone should take that view of his actions. To her credit, Mother did organise an appointment with her GP the following morning.

 

Mother saw her GP, Dr S on the morning of 5th July. The Maternal Grandfather accompanied his daughter and granddaughter to the appointment. During the consultation, Mother told the GP that she first noticed the bruise on 2nd July. The note also reads "Mother has noticed when the child has contact with the Father (supervised visit with Grandparents) she comes home with bruises." A had two linear bruises to her lower leg. Unsurprisingly in light of what she had been told and what she had seen, the GP took the view that a Child Protection Medical was warranted. The GP had clear concerns; the shape and location of the bruise, the lack of explanation for them and no doubt the account given by Mother that the child often had bruises after contact.

 

Dr S filed a witness statement and gave evidence before the Court. There is little doubt in my view that the doctor made it plain to Mother that Social Services were to be informed of the bruising and that they would need to make the arrangements for the appointment. Dr S had tried to make the appointment herself but had been informed that the Local Authority had to take responsibility for that. The GP was clear in her evidence that in concluding her consultation she had told B to expect a telephone call from the Social Worker that day. Although Mother disputes that she was told to expect a phone call that day (it could be that day or Monday), the contemporaneous notes support the recollection of the GP. In any event by that stage it should have been obvious to mother that the professionals were sufficiently concerned about the bruising to be organising a review by a paediatrician. 

 

Mother told the Court that she had planned to go to Birmingham that weekend. She had been let down by her father who had cancelled a trip to London that weekend and so she had decided at short notice to take A away. She indicated to the Court that everything was last minute and that she had made the arrangements the night before; although her father thought he had a recollection of arrangements being made earlier in the week. 

 

It appears that, notwithstanding the turn of events at the GP's, neither Mother nor Maternal Grandfather took the view that the trip to Birmingham ought to be rescheduled.  No explanation has been given as to why Mother had to go to Birmingham that weekend, other than she had made some late arrangements. She had not in fact purchased her train ticket as that was done immediately before travel.

 

After leaving the GP's surgery, Mother and A went to Mother's home. A then went down to sleep whilst Mother packed for the trip. Maternal Grandfather then took them to the station to catch the train just after 2pm. The Maternal Grandfather apparently had suggested to his daughter that if the Social Worker had not contacted Mother by that time, that she should leave. It seemingly did not cross his mind to suggest that either of them contact the Social Worker.

 

After Mother had boarded the train there were repeated attempts by the Social Worker to contact Mother. Mother accepts that despite what had occurred that morning she had her put her phone on silent. The only explanation for that was that "is what teenagers do." It seems to this Court that Mother was determined that nothing should interfere with the trip. The Social Worker therefore did not make contact with Mother until late afternoon when she had arrived in Birmingham. At that stage Mother did offer to present the child to a local hospital, but that was not compatible with the organisation of a Child Protection Medical.

 

Having heard the GP this Court is of the view that Mother and Maternal Grandfather would have been left in no doubt that the wheels were in motion for a Child Protection Medical to take place. Mother was determined to go to Birmingham that weekend although the Court has not been given any clear reason why the trip could not be postponed. Indeed, a concerned mother suggesting that a child was repeatedly returning from contact with bruises would have wanted the medical enquiry as quickly as possible. She would have made that a priority. This mother did not. 

 

This Court is concerned that even now, Mother in her evidence continued to assert that the bruises might have been linked to contact, as she said that she had no other explanation.  Mother did not accept that if this child had returned with bruises on 26th June, it is highly unlikely and frankly not credible that Mother would not have seen them until 5 or so days later. Additionally, Maternal Grandfather told the Court that prior to the visit to the GP he had offered a possible explanation to his daughter for the bruises. He had thought that A might have sustained the bruise on a piece of equipment in the park. Mother says (through her counsel) that she has no recollection of this. This in itself is surprising as the family would have been searching for an innocent explanation. Further, it is unusual that there is no suggestion by Mother either at the time or since of Maternal Grandfather offering a possible explanation. Nor did Mother raise as a possibility that the bruises may have occurred in the care of either of her parents.

 

The Social Worker was clear that the bruise in July needed to be properly investigated. It was not. It is clear that Mother thwarted the process. This Court is left with the conclusion that she wanted to prioritise her trip to Birmingham. The bruises are unlikely to have occurred in contact with the paternal family as that would require an acceptance that Mother had failed to notice them for 5 or so days. However, Mother saw the opportunity to use the fact of the bruises to undermine contact by the making of what undoubtedly were false allegations as to the child sustaining regular bruises during contact. This is likely to have been a direct response to the stressful meeting that had taken place on 25th June. This appears to be a further example of Mother's responses to stressors.

 

Mr Z
Mother told the Court that Mr Z is a friend that she met using the internet connection of her Xbox prior to the birth of A. She said that she and Mr Z would often chat and play games together. He lives in the North of England. Despite the longevity of their acquaintance, there was no face to face meeting between them until June 2013. At that stage they meet for a few hours and then on a monthly basis. Mr Z would travel 5 hours by train in order to spend but a few hours with Mother before travelling back that same day. On any view this was a very long trip for a very short period of time with B, without even considering the financial cost.

 

 During the week between Halloween and Bonfire Night in 2013 (for 5 days and 4 nights) Mr Z stayed at Mother's flat. Both B and A were present. The sleeping arrangements were confirmed by Mother. She accepted that he shared her double bed, although Mother suggests that there was and is no ongoing relationship between them. The Court does not understand why he did not sleep on the sofa.  Mother told the Court that this trip was arranged as Mr Z wanted to spend more time with Mother but also that he wanted to spend more time with and get to know A.  Mother's perception of this is unlikely to be valid, although it may well have been Mother's distorted belief. So it was that a relative stranger not only occupied the home but shared intimate domestic arrangements. There appears to have been no sense of caution in operation on Mother's part before introducing to her home and to A a man with whom her only contact had been through the internet in pursuit of online gaming. 

 

 Mother was asked by Ms H (Social Worker) on their first meeting where Mr Z had stayed. Mother had said that he had stayed in a local hotel. Mother accepts that this was a lie. The Social Worker was making enquiries as Mr Z had been seen entering Mother's home after a fireworks display. This was not an isolated incident as Mother repeated the lie subsequently to the Social Worker. 

 

As the Court has recorded, Mother accepts that she lied but gave an explanation that she had felt concerned that the Social Worker might consider removal of A. However, that makes little sense when Mother does not actually accept that she was aware that she had to notify Social Services about his presence. Much reliance was placed on Mother's behalf on the absence of any PwP agreement. This is an intelligent Mother who must have had a motive for lying. The motive is that Mother either knew or would have realised that the Local Authority would need to know details of this man. In that situation she took a deliberate decision not to share relevant information with the Social Worker and went on to lie about the situation.

 

In my judgment this is yet a further example of Mother's way of dealing with issues when she is challenged. Often her response is to lie. This is her maladaptive way of coping with the situation. It matters not whether the lies are significant as in this case or are not. It renders Mother an unreliable source of information. On this occasion it was a significant event for the current Social Worker not only because of the lie that was told, but it reinforced for her just how plausible and credible Mother presents when telling lies. 

 

It became apparent during the evidence that Mother also lied to her father (and I think her mother) about the sleeping arrangements that were in place when Mr Z visited B's home. Maternal Grandfather had been told by B that the sleeping arrangements were for Mr Z to sleep downstairs on the sofa. What was surprising and of concern is that despite Maternal Grandparents having very little information about this man neither sought to raise any concern with B about her decision that Mr Z should be in the home with A overnight. There was no attempt to challenge their daughter or even offer advice. In fact even during his evidence Maternal Grandfather did not seem to understand the concern that had been raised by others about this arrangement. They should at least have asked B to be cautious about this course of action. Their failure to do so must be seen as an indication that the Maternal Grandparents are either unwilling or unable to adopt a protective role for their daughter and granddaughter. 

 

These are once again significant lies told by Mother and considerable failings on the part of the Maternal Grandparents. This Court is concerned that the Maternal Grandparents do not seem to have any protective instinct, no ability to conceptualise risk and therefore cannot be relied upon to intervene to supplement any protective framework. 

 

Given the circumstances as outlined by Mother in her evidence this Court is far from satisfied that Mother has been truthful, even now, as to the nature of her relationship with Mr Z. The circumstances as outlined by her are difficult to understand. The impression that the Court has been left with after hearing her evidence is that Mother has only volunteered what she felt was necessary for the Court to hear. In my judgment she has at the very least been economical with the truth. Once again B will understand the consequences of her decision not to be open and honest.

 

Accordingly it is the finding of the Court that the concerns around B's functioning identified at the hearing in March last year are still present. Further, little has been done by the Local Authority in the time since the making of the Care Order to make the task of keeping the child safe more manageable.

 

It is against that background that the Court has to consider the welfare analysis. In this case there is no issue that A should live with her mother. The issue for the Court is what order if any is required in order to allow Mother to adequately parent the child in her care. The Court should not consider the Mother in isolation but look at whether there are others who may reduce the indentified risks. In March 2013 the Court made a number of findings about the extended family of A. These can be summarised as follows:

 
•    That C was a weak and immature man. He had failed to acknowledge any responsibility for the situation that he found himself in.
•    The Paternal Grandparents had at times tried to make up for the failings of their son. They were alert to his failures and hurt by them. They had over-indulged their son and relieved him of his responsibilities. The Paternal Grandmother was torn between trying to parent her son and protect the welfare of A.
•    The Maternal Grandparents had no conception of any risk posed by their daughter to their granddaughter. They were described as na�ve and incapable of challenging B. She was found to be manipulative of them.

Having listened to the evidence and read the updating material, the Court does not wish to alter or amend those findings. It is satisfied that each of them is as pertinent today as they were in March 2013.

 

The Court therefore has to ask itself whether the risk that B poses to her daughter has changed or ameliorated? Having considered the up to date evidence the Court is firmly of the view that it has not reduced. The framework for the management of risk as outlined by Prof Grey has not been put in place. The Local Authority largely abandoned risk management after the judgment in March 2013. The services that were provided were not those that were envisaged. There has not been any real attempt to identify appropriate alternatives.  A mental health advocate and a CS volunteer have, at various times, engaged with B but neither of these has undertaken the role envisaged by Prof Grey. For example neither has access to the judgment and neither has had any role in dealing with the issues that impact upon risk.  B has not moved on in terms of displaying any recognition or insight into her difficulties despite the passage of time and the wealth of material that she has had access to. In relation to risk factors it is as if time has stood still.

 


A further and significant criticism of the Local Authority is that they have not provided for A the benefit of effective social working. Since the final hearing she has had a number of social workers who have merely dipped into the case and who have failed properly to understand the complex risk management issues that need to be marshalled for effective protection of A. These Social Workers have no doubt been misled by the view taken by senior local authority managers during that period that this is a "simple case" and their resolute refusal to accept the Court's analysis of risk. This deficit was reinforced by the failures of the Local Authority even to comply with the formal requirements for placement with the mother. This, I am satisfied had the effect of leaving this child without any appropriate protection until September 2013, when the first LAC Review was convened. Even at that stage the Independent Reviewing Officer was labouring under a misapprehension as to the child's status. It was not until this Court's expectations were reinforced by the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the Local Authority took any appropriate steps to protect the child.

 

However, this Court accepts that whilst the past twelve months are important, it is the future for A that this Court has to consider. The question therefore is what Order if any is required in order to protect her from the risks identified and particularised in the judgment of May 2013 (the Court having already considered that these risks and found that they have not changed or diminished since that time).The Court therefore is required to conduct "the necessary and proper proportionality exercise"

 

First the Court accepts the general submission made by Miss Meyer that in light of the recent authorities coming from the Higher Courts that the approach of this Court should be one of a "global holistic multi-faceted evaluation of the child's welfare, which takes into account all the negatives and the positives all the pros and cons of each option" see Re B-S (children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.

 

The first matter to have in mind is that all parties expect that A is to remain in her mother's care. The plan is that short of an emergency they should not be separated. In addition it is conceded by the Local Authority that they have a responsibility to and will provide all services identified in their plan as being needed by the child irrespective of any order, if necessary as a "Child in Need." Therefore The Court accepts that an order is not necessary to secure that provision. 

 

The Court also has in mind that there are very real disadvantages to a child in being the subject of a Care Order. One of which is that in sharing parental responsibility with the parents, the Local Authority has power to remove the child from the placement. However, that power of the Local Authority is not absolute it is circumscribed by their duty to act in accordance with the law. It must be discharged legitimately and in circumstances which are both transparent and accountable. It is not and should not be for the Court to assume otherwise. There is a legal framework within which the Local Authority can act. There is, in my judgement, whatever other charge may be levelled at this Local Authority, no justifiable criticism that they have sought to act outside the law. However, the Court accepts that the knowledge that this is a feature of a Care Order does on occasion cause stress for parents who are subject to these Orders. This is a considerable negative by-product of the order. The fact that this power exists adds weight to the balancing exercise when the Court considers the impact of each type of order. 

 

The Court must also have in mind that a Care Order may be intrusive for the child concerned. This is an intrusion, especially as the child becomes older and more aware of the consequences of being a "looked after" child. The issues are well rehearsed, they do not need repeating but I bear them in mind. These are particular to the nature of Care Orders and are not features of a Supervision Order.

 

The underlying purpose of a Supervision Order is to advise, assist and befriend the child. However, as Mr Geekie Q.C (Counsel for the child) reminded the Court of Appeal a Supervision Order has no teeth, that is no mechanism for securing compliance of a parent short of returning a parent to Court by virtue of a further application to the Court for a Care Order. Unlike the regime under a Care Order, with a Supervision Order there is no regulatory regime of planning and support in place to underpin the Supervision Order. There is little or indeed nothing to distinguish the duties of a Local Authority under a Supervision Order from their statutory duties in meeting the needs of a particular child under a "Child in Need" plan. By its very nature therefore the Order is less intrusive and does not impact on the parents' exercise of parental responsibility.

 

The Court therefore has to consider the general but important features of these Orders and commit them to analysis of the factual matrix in respect of this child using the framework of the welfare checklist.

 

The general starting point is the findings of fact both in the judgement of 11th March 2013 (all have survived the appellate process) and the findings contained within this judgement. The Court's analysis as set out earlier is that there is no evidence of change in the risk that B poses to A. In fact quite the reverse. There is evidence which the Court has accepted which shows that the risk has not changed. There has in fact been a further opportunity for Mother to engage with the Local Authority in pursuance of their duty to protect of A. Whilst there has been partial compliance, B has engaged on her own terms. In addition this engagement has been in circumstances where she has not been subject to any significant challenge, in particular around her own lifestyle choices. It is not that the Local Authority have not had the opportunity to challenge; they have, as when the Local Authority had cause to become concerned on the facts as then known (the trip to Birmingham and Mr Z staying at the home). The Local Authority have not taken the opportunity to do so. The present Social Worker does not know whether the Mother has yet to be taken through the judgements of this Court. 

 

History tells us that it is generally but not exclusively at times of conflict with those in perceived authority that B withdraws from the relationship, (see findings in the previous judgment as to the relationship with the foster carer). It was the observation of the Court in the March judgment that B had said in the (then recent) past that she will not change who she is, even if it meant losing A (para 62). She has clearly, in my judgment, not learned from her mistakes. That is likely to be because, even now after the passage of time and with the benefit of significant material and advice, she does not see the findings as mistakes. The Court is reinforced in that view by her oral evidence, during which she showed little or no insight into the events of the last 12 months. There was no reflection let alone regret. 

 

Therefore in my judgment B continues to manipulate and undermine by the use of lies. Her behaviour is pathological in nature. For example B heard during the previous proceedings Prof Grey in evidence indicating that one of the possible concerns might be that B would lie about injuries to A at the hands of her Paternal Grandparents or father. B must have understood this to be a flashpoint yet she was unable to curtail her compulsion to lie about this when A sustained the injury to her leg in July. There is no evidence other than this was a lie. There has been no attempt to raise this as an issue when the Court has been considering contact. In addition her immediate reaction when cornered by the Social Worker as to whether Mr Z had stayed at the home was to lie. A lie which was repeated when she had had time to reflect upon the situation and had the ongoing assistance of legal advice. Once again B's demeanour was such that it was not obvious to the Social Worker that B was indeed lying. It was, as usual, a lie told in a deceptively plausible way by B. The instinct of Mother when challenged is to disengage, to lie and not to work in partnership with the Local Authority. 

 

It can be said in broad terms that B has promoted contact during the last twelve months. However, this has been on the basis that she has had overall control. This has been allowed to happen as the Social Workers on the ground have been disabled by their lack of understanding of the case. The Court nearly a year ago was working on the basis that there would be staying contact within a short time after the conclusion of that hearing. It has not happened and whilst the Court accepts that there have been some issues in the recent past, in my judgment it should have been promoted by the Local Authority within a short while after the last hearing. These are grandparents who have been positively assessed to care for A. They are loving and committed. There can be no doubt that they would properly look after A when she is in their care. It is unfortunate that C still continues to display immaturity and lack of enthusiasm at prioritising his daughter. That is likely to remain the position for the foreseeable future. Recent events show that there is little catalyst for maturity. That should however not undermine A's relationship with her Paternal Grandparents. The Local Authority should now move this forward.

 

The Court is hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Ms H the current Social Worker was allocated on 4th November 2013. She gave evidence before the Court and was an impressive witness. She has, this Court is satisfied, read into the case and has a more informed understanding of the issues. She is therefore substantially more equipped to protect A. She has had recent experience of B being plausible but lying. This has no doubt brought a graphic illustration to the issues in this case. The fundamental problem is the psychological makeup of Band the inability of those closest to her to recognise the risk factors, let alone effectively intervene to diminish them. This remains a complex case and will continue to be so as neither age nor maturity of B is likely to reduce the maladaptive ways of Mother. She will in all likelihood continue to use lying as a coping mechanism particularly at times of stress. It will be an ever present feature of B's personality. Her mother's love or ability to meet her physical needs will not be a protective factor for A. Nothing that has emerged since B's return to the community has given this Court any confidence for a finding that the risks have been reduced. On the contrary the recent incidents have shown that B's behaviour (as described in the Court's previous judgments) will continue to put A at risk.

 

This Social Worker understands that the risks are difficult to manage partially as a result of the difficulty in recognising or predicting the behaviours of B. Any professional working with Mother must be vigilant and alert to the constant need to verify information that is given by her to them. Even when resources are put in place there can be no assumption that B is working in partnership with the Local Authority in an open and honest way. Nor should it be left to B to report any difficulty or to seek out help. The Local Authority will have to be proactive rather than reactive. That is the only effective way of managing risk. There needs to be an understanding that collaborative working is likely to be impossible. There should be a procedure adopted within the Local Authority for core information and analysis to be available to any person taking over case responsibility or dealing with any issue in the absence of the case holding Social Worker.

 

In addition for reasons outlined both in this judgment and previously, the Local Authority need to accept that they are unable to rely upon a productive risk reduction framework based upon the extended family. Recent history has shown that the Maternal Grandparents in particular cannot be relied upon either to prioritise A over their daughter or to give their daughter sound advice.

 

How should the Court then decide what Order, if any, is necessary? The law is set out in the judgment of 11th March 2013. No issue has been taken with the Court's identification of the relevant law and so the Court is not going to repeat the same. In addition I have in mind the references set out in some detail in the written final submissions of Ms Meyer which highlights the impact of recent case law. 

 

There is no issue here but that A will live at home with her mother. The Court could make no order and rely upon the Local Authority to provide services as part of a Child in Need package. The Court could formalise the arrangement by the imposition of a Supervision Order, but in my judgement that would bring little additional benefit to the child. The Court could impose a Family Assistance Order, no party suggests that and that Order brings little if any additional benefit over the other Orders.

 

The Court should start by considering whether the least interventionist order will meet the risk(s) identified. The difficulty in this case is that the Mother cannot be relied upon to identify and/or prioritise the best interests of her daughter. Recent events have shown that she has put her own needs first, with the possibility of risk to her daughter. This is a Mother who is psychologically impaired and probably unable to achieve collaborative working with the Local Authority. Under a Supervision Order the Local Authority would be powerless to be reactive to Mother's failings or proactive to prevent any course of action. This is clearly seen from the events of the last twelve months. Either No Order or a Supervision Order would leave A exposed to the potential of harm. 

 

The principal reasons for considering whether a Care Order is necessary are rehearsed in the case law and in the Court's March judgment. The first is the possibility of removal without prior judicial sanction. In reality this could be achieved by the use of an Emergency Protection Order or an urgent application for an ICO on reduced notice.  The sort of circumstances where removal could be envisaged are likely to fit that scenario.

 

The second reason is the necessity of the Local Authority to share parental responsibility. Care Orders are of course at the most draconian end of the spectrum of public law orders, they are a significant infringement of a parent's and a child's Article 8 rights. Accordingly a Care Order should only be made where it is deemed proportionate to the identified risk(s) and necessary (in the sense that nothing else will do) in the circumstances. 

 

In my judgement the Local Authority needs to share parental responsibility with the parents of A. There is merit in the submission of the Children's Guardian that it would be unworkable for the person whose psychological functioning is impaired to be (effectively) the sole repository of parental responsibility. B will have dealings with professionals though her daughter's life. The impairment in her functioning is not likely to change and will be something that is liable to affect one or more aspects of   A's life. At these times the Local Authority may need to intervene to ensure that A's interests are prioritised. They will not be able (or be permitted) to intervene if they do not share parental responsibility. The ability of the Local Authority to manage the risk by intervention is at the heart of the care plan. A Supervision Order or indeed any other order short of a Care Order will not facilitate that. That is why a Care Order is necessary. Nothing short of that order will do.

 

First the major issue for the safety of A is effective management of risk. The Local Authority will be unable to manage risk if they do not have the ability to force issues, if necessary. This has been clearly demonstrated by B deciding to prioritise her own needs by first leaving for Birmingham when any reasonable parent would have checked on the arrangements prior to leaving. Additionally, by making a conscious decision to leave her telephone on silent during the journey. It is clear she had made her decision to go and nothing was going to interfere with that decision. 

 

A second example is allowing Mr Z to stay in her flat despite her having very little information about him. Contrary to her protestations to the contrary she must have known that this was not permitted or indeed acceptable behaviour otherwise it is difficult to understand why she would lie to the Social Worker. She also lied to her parents as to the sleeping arrangements; again she must have known that this was unlikely to have been viewed by them as suitable behaviour as A was part of the household. She acted against the interests of A despite this. Once again this is prioritisation of her own needs over those of her daughter.

 

In respect of these actions, this Court is satisfied that even with the benefit of hindsight B still does not recognise or accept that her behaviour was selfish and inappropriate. The Court cannot therefore be satisfied that it has formed part of a learning curve for her (or her parents). Similar decisions are likely to be made in the future and the Local Authority will need to intervene.

 

Having considered both the nature of the risk and the Local Authority's ability to manage the risk under the Orders that are available to the Court, the Court has decided that only a Care Order will sufficiently protect this child from the impact of the risk that emanates from her mother. The root of the ability to manage the risk comes from the sharing of parental responsibility with the parents.

 

Contact is another important but not determinative issue. It must be accepted that disputes as to contact per se should not and do not warrant intrusion by the State into what are in essence private matters. The issue of contact is underpinned by Mother's opposition to contact moving on. Additionally, there is the very real danger (as already seen) that the child herself will be affected as she will become the subject of false allegations made against the paternal family to support the Mother's opposition to contact. The dynamic is further complicated by concerns around C and the Paternal Grandparents. There remains also a high level of ill-feeling and mistrust between the two sides of the family. Whilst the Court accepts that there has been some flexibility in the arrangements that the Mother has been prepared to promote, the impression of the Court has been that Mother's attitude to contact has been boundaried by the fact that the Local Authority has shared parental responsibility since the last hearing. In particular the Court has in mind the inability of the paternal family or indeed the Local Authority to satisfy mother in respect of the arrangements for the christening  of A's cousin's. Yet Mother went on to have A christened without any reference to the Father let alone offering any invitation to attend.

 

Furthermore there is her inability or unwillingness to give a full account to professionals of who had had contact with Ain the days leading up to the bruising in July. This was part of her determination to promote the view that the bruises were caused at contact with the paternal family, even though the consequence of that was a finding that she had not seen the bruising for days. B then embellished this by the suggestion that A regularly returns from contact with bruises.  This was a lie to undermine A's relationship with the paternal family. How would this be managed without the sharing of parental responsibility?

 

The relationship between Mother and the paternal family continues to be strained and is likely to remain so after yet another period of litigation. The Mother cannot be relied upon to take decisions in respect of contact between A and her paternal family that are governed by the best interests of the child or rooted in fact. It is to be anticipated that the move to overnight stays will not be without further difficulty that now has to be managed by the Local Authority. 

 

Some of the Court's time has been taken with the consideration of contact between A and her father and the Paternal Grandparents. At the conclusion of the proceedings there was to a large extent agreement between the parties that the Local Authority need to undertake a short assessment of matters which had come to light during the evidence. I approve of that course. However, the Local Authority must in my judgment take responsibility for driving contact forward between A and her paternal family. Staying contact has been under review for some time, it has to be remembered that the Paternal Grandparents are approved by the Local Authority. Contact was also intended to be part of the protective network for A.

 

The Local Authority have now produced a care plan that the Court is able to approve. In doing so I have had regard to s1 of the Children Act 1989, "the welfare checklist". I am satisfied that A's welfare lies in her remaining with her mother. But it is also a necessary part of her welfare needs to have ongoing contact with the paternal family. In order to keep her safe from the potential harm the Local Authority needs to share parental responsibility. I am satisfied that albeit belatedly the Local Authority recognise the complexities of his case. It is the Court's hope that the present Social Worker will be in post for some time. The Local Authority have now complied with the expectations of the Court. However, this does not bring any diminution of the duties that they owe to A under the Care Order that I propose to make. I endorse the views of the Children's Guardian that a system of recording on their internal files needs to be achieved whereby those charged with making decisions for A have a means of assimilating relevant information relatively quickly. How the Local Authority achieve that system is a matter for them. I also agree that it is important that all relevant documentation should be disclosed to the Independent Reviewing Officer.

 

In light of the Court's comments above, I do not propose making a s34 Order as that would be difficult in the context of an outstanding assessment.

HHJ Murfitt : 
	This judgment concerns A who was born in November 2012 and who is now 16 months old.  A's mother is 24 and his father is 43. The parents were married in June 2013 and accordingly both share parental responsibility for A.  

 
	Consultant Psychologist Dr Andrew Derry identified in his report of July 2013 that the mother has a global IQ of 52 and thus a significant impairment in her intellectual ability. This he considers is such as to meet the criteria for learning disability. He subsequently provided a certificate of incapacity with the consequence that on 8th August 2013 the Official Solicitor was invited to represent her. Eventually in October 2013 the Official Solicitor accepted the appointment and he has since represented her. 

 

	A's father has a long history of violence and sexual offending, and is currently the subject of a suspended sentence of four weeks following his conviction under s4(1) and (4) of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. This arises amongst other things out of threats, which he made to kill A's maternal grandfather. A restraining order imposed as part of the father's sentence prohibits him from contacting the grandfather or the grandfather's partner directly or indirectly by any means whatsoever, save through a solicitor or through the family Court. The order also prohibits him from entering an area which covers the home address of the grandfather and his partner, and it will expire in August 2015. The father is currently under the management of the Public Protection Unit as a high risk offender. His criminal record includes convictions for actual bodily harm to a baby, a conviction for rape, more than one conviction for indecent assault, another for possession of a bladed article, as well as numerous petty offences relating to dishonesty and road traffic matters. The Criminal Justice Mental health team has diagnosed the father with a psychopathic disorder.

 

	A's grandfather and his fianc�e have cared for A for the majority of his life and have been joined as parties to these proceedings.  On 15th March 2013 they were granted an interim residence order in relation to A. They have since applied for, and been granted leave to pursue an application for an Adoption Order. All parties, with the exception of the father, who has not played an active part in these proceedings since March 2013, agree that A should remain in the care of the grandfather and his partner.  The couple has been comprehensively assessed and without exception the resulting reports have highlighted that they have provided and continue to provide A with a high standard of care and that the grandfather's partner is A's primary attachment figure.  

 

	There is nevertheless considerable disagreement between the parties as to the type of order which is required to safeguard A's needs in this placement, and the issue also arises as to the level and nature of contact between A and his mother following the conclusion of these proceedings, and what if any orders should be made in that regard.  The Applicants and the Guardian are opposed to any formal contact orders being made, whilst the mother seeks an order for monthly supervised contact between A and herself. The Local Authority argues that an order for twice yearly contact with the mother is appropriate together with a Family Assistance Order if that can be agreed, but with no contact to the father.

 

	The grandfather and his partner's application for an Adoption Order in relation to A is supported by A's litigation Guardian. However A's mother and the Local Authority argue that a more appropriate order would be a Special Guardianship Order in favour of the Applicants.  Whilst s14 of the Children Act would require prior leave to be obtained before the making of any application to vary or discharge a special Guardianship order, the Local Authority and Official Solicitor suggest that an order under section 91.14 of the Children Act may be appropriate to act as a barrier to any other unwarranted future applications by the parents, by requiring preliminary leave to be obtained first. The Local Authority also proposes that a number of supplemental orders might also be made such as a permission to change A's name under s14B(2)(a) of the Children Act 1989 and an order for general leave to remove him from the jurisdiction for periods in excess of 3 months under s14B(2)(b). In the initial skeleton arguments filed on behalf of the Local Authority and Official Solicitor it was argued that an order under s4(2A) of the Children Act might also be made to limit or discharge father's parental responsibility. However since his parental responsibility was acquired through his marriage to the mother, s4(2A) will not apply to him, and his ability to exercise his parental responsibility cannot be circumscribed or eliminated through that means, as the Local Authority and Official Solicitor now accept.

 

	All parties, with the exception of the father, have filed lengthy skeleton arguments in support of their respective positions, as well as written final submissions. I have read each of these as well as the statements filed by the parties, including the Special Guardianship Report of A's social worker dated 19.7.13 and the expert report of Dr Derry, and final report of the Guardian. I also read an Independent Social Work Assessment dated 23.12.2013 which was prepared at the Court's direction concerning the Applicants' suitability as potential adopters for A, and this also considered the merits of a special Guardianship order in the alternative. That report concluded by recommending that consideration should be given to an adoption order as the better alternative for A. I heard oral evidence from the allocated social worker, as well as from the grandparents, and finally from the Guardian. Mother chose not to give any live evidence whilst her husband, as mentioned, did not attend the hearing.

 

	The background history to the Local Authority's involvement is summarized in the findings of fact and reasons prepared by DJ Dawson (MC) on 22nd February 2012 when she made an Emergency protection order in relation to A.  In the light of the father's offending history the Local Authority undertook a pre-birth assessment, and whilst this was in progress on 15 August 2012, father threatened suicide and took an overdose, which he explained was a response to the stress of being under the scrutiny of social care. A's mother remained unwilling to separate from him, although in the light of their disparate ages and intellects there were concerns that he was both violent and controlling towards her. 

 

	A's mother did however agree to go and live with her grandmother  following A's birth, and arrangements were made for the father to have supervised contact. After an argument between the father and the maternal great grandmother which led to the former sitting on the bonnet of the latter's car to prevent her moving whilst A was inside, that arrangement broke down. On New Year 's Day 2013, the mother decided to take A to see the father notwithstanding her prior agreement with the local authority that she would not permit him to have unsupervised contact, and in spite of her grandmother's attempts to dissuade her from going. Sadly as a result of the mother's decision the maternal great grandmother concluded that she was no longer able to accommodate her granddaughter and great grandson because of the risks posed by the father. From this point mother decided to go and live with father and his family, and as a result A was placed by the Local Authority in the temporary care of his maternal grandfather and his partner.

 


	However on 13th February 2013 the father threatened to attend the grandfather's home and smash the windows and/or harm him. The grandfather was so concerned about what the father might do, that he called the Local Authority in great distress saying that he and his family no longer felt safe or able to care for or protect A in the light of the threats that had been made. It is fair to observe that this is likely to have been precisely the consequence which the father hoped to achieve. Neither parent was willing to agree to A's placement with alternative Local Authority foster carers under s20 Children Act. 

 

	On 19th February father once again made further loud and aggressive threats against the grandfather whilst attending contact at a contact centre. Staff found father difficult to control and had to remove him from the room to prevent further distress to A. Later on in the same day, the Police were called to escort him from the Local Authority's premises, after he had threatened to remove A from the grandfather's home, and then after pushing a chair at a security guard, he threatened to 'break the social worker into pieces'. 

 

	This was not the first occasion on which the father had shown hostility and aggression towards those involved in his son's care. At the initial child protection conference on 21.11.12 his threatening behaviour caused so much alarm to the mother that an ambulance was called to take her to hospital for observation. At the Child Protection Conference review meeting on 19.12.12 the independent Reviewing officer found it necessary to remove him from the room due to his aggressive behaviour. On 9 January 2013 the father turned up uninvited to an appointment which the mother was attending at a mother and baby unit, and was verbally abusive to the social worker when he was requested to leave. 

 

	It was as a result of his unpredictable behaviour that the Local Authority initially sought an EPO without notice to the father, because they were concerned that his reaction upon being served with the proceedings would pose a direct threat to A's safety. On 22nd February 2013 A was duly removed from the care of the grandfather and his partner and placed with local authority foster carers under an emergency protection order. Following this an interim care order was made by DJ Dawson on 28th February 2013 when directions were given for a viability assessment of the grandfather and his partner to be undertaken.  When complete this was positive, and a residence order was thereafter made in their favour on 15th March 2013. A 'Prohibited Steps Order' was also added forbidding the father from entering the vicinity of the grandfather's home, other then when travelling on a bus. Those orders remain in force to date, although the Local Authority questions whether the prohibitive parts of that order meet the requirements of s8 of the Children Act, in that A is not referred to, and it is not clear how the order aims at prohibiting "a step which could be taken by a parent in meeting his parental responsibility for a child."

 

 
	Eleven days later on 26th March 2013 the parties returned to Court for a case management hearing, and on this occasion (as is recorded in the recitals heading the order made on that day) the father sacked his legal representative, stating that he no longer wished to be assessed, or to play a part in the proceedings, and that he would not be attending any future contacts with A. I note that both the statement of the previous social worker dated 26.7.13 and the Guardian's report of 10th February 2014 indicate that this happened at the hearing on 15th March 2013. Whichever was the correct date in March, both professionals confirm that the father was very aggressive towards the grandfather's partner on this occasion whilst at Court. The Guardian who witnessed the incident describes 'a very frightening scene in which the father attempted to grab the grandfather's partner across the table in the interview room where she was sitting with the grandfather', and it is apparent that the father was thereafter forcibly removed from the Court precincts by security guards. 

 

	It is clear that the Applicants have been on the receiving end of considerable antipathy from the father, and at times also from the mother, although in the latter's case the Applicants consider this likely to be at the father's instigation or direction. On 5th March 2013 the previous social worker records that both parents made allegations against the grandfather and his partner and her children. It was alleged that as a result of Social care disclosing the details of the father's convictions to them, there were arguments within the grandfather's family which were impacting negatively on A. The mother also made an allegation against the grandfather's partner and her adult daughter, that they had assaulted her on 22nd February 2013 when A was removed into care. As a result of this allegation the grandfather's partner was later arrested on 14th May 2013, and then held in custody for nine hours before being released on bail. This I accept would have been a very distressing experience for her, especially since at the conclusion of their enquiries the Police concluded that the allegations were unfounded, and took no further action. 

 

	On the 13th March 2013 the parents arrived on the applicants' doorstep shouting and causing so much distress that the Police were called. Next day at contact on 14th March, the mother alleged that A had been injured by one of the Grandfather's partner's daughters. She also alleged that both the partner and her daughter were heavy drinkers and incapable of caring for A, and that the grandfather had presented as drunk when he had attended at the home of the father's parents. The Guardian records that the mother also suggested to her that grandfather's partner was sexually unfaithful to the grandfather.  However none of these allegations have since been pursued or substantiated.

 

 
	In her position statement filed for the hearing on 26th March 2013the mother maintained that she had ended her relationship with the father, and that she was actively seeking alternative council accommodation as she  now wished to care for A on her own. Notwithstanding this, on 17th May the grandfather's partner reported to A's social worker that she had learned via Facebook that the mother was due to marry the father on 19th June 2013, although when she was directly asked about this, the mother denied it was the case.  

 

	Nevertheless on 22nd May both mother and father attended at the grandfather's partner's place of part-time work, and created a scene which caused the latter considerable public and professional embarrassment. Specifically father accused the grandfather's partner of staring at him out of the store window whilst he and the mother were passing, and advised staff and customers that the store had a 'criminal' working for them. The grandfather's partner was not in fact working in the store on that day, and she was clear that she had never seen them passing either. This was one of the incidents in a series which had occurred since February 2013, culminating in a threat which father made to kill the grandfather via the "Irish traveler community", which ultimately led to the father being arrested and charged under the Protection from Harassment Act in July 2013. For these offences he was subsequently convicted and sentenced in August 2013 as detailed above.  At the time of his arrest the father also made allegations of harassment against the grandfather. These too were duly investigated by the Police, and as with the allegations made by mother, were ultimately found to have been made maliciously. The Police have put in place certain measures including provision of a panic alarm to the grandfather and his partner in order to protect them.

 

	Despite her position statement filed in March, and her denial to social workers in May of having any plans to marry the mother and father were nevertheless married in mid June 2013. It is reasonable to conclude that the position presented by the mother to professionals and to the Court prior to her marriage was more the result of advice that she had received as to where her best interests might lie, rather than a reflection of her personal feelings in the matter. I note that the Guardian's observation of the mother's demeanour at Court in March 2013 when the father was aggressive towards the grandfather's partner and had to be removed, is also consistent with this. Although the mother appeared very upset whilst in Court and had to be comforted by her barrister, as soon as she exited from Court she was observed to be smiling, as if (in the Guardian's words) 'her tears had been turned off with a switch'. 

 

	In his psychological assessment of the mother Dr Derry noted that whilst she did not describe any history of abuse or maltreatment in her childhood, she remained extremely preoccupied by feelings of abandonment and rejection by her father, arising from her parents' separation during her childhood when her father left her mother. He noted that the mother's adult attachment strategy indicated a tendency to exaggerate personal difficulties in order to recruit care and support, and that she assumes a submissive position in her adult relationships to eschew fears of rejection and abandonment. He added that her drive to resolve her feelings about her relationships would often obscure her thinking about A, making her less able to prioritise his needs over her own. Specifically it would increase her vulnerability to abuse within her relationships, and reduce her self protective and child protective behaviours. Mother described symptoms of PTSD in the past arising from severe physical and sexual abuse which she said she had experienced in her past adult relationships, although these symptoms fell short of the criteria for a disorder. However she described a reduction in such symptoms when with the father, with whom she said she feels 'safe'. This Dr Derry observed only increases her desire to be with him. In Dr Derry's opinion mother's intellectual ability also impairs her ability to understand the potential risks to A notwithstanding her knowledge of father's offending history. Dr Derry assessed her as having a particularly poor appreciation of her son's thoughts feelings and experiences, which he considers is a poor predictor of her ability to be sensitively attuned to A's developmental needs, and being less aware of distress associated with abuse, she would be less able to act protectively. In his assessment the quality of her parent-child attachment interaction was in the 'inadequate' range. He observed that there was little reciprocal interaction with A, who often resisted any bids for engagement on her part. Noting that she was extremely limited in her understanding of the risks presented by the father, and in the estimation of her own ability to manage these, Dr Derry concluded that the mother would not have the potential to protect A within that relationship, and that she would be likely to conceal the relationship from family and professionals. He recommended that A should not be returned to either parent's care, and that contact with his mother should be reduced. He opined that "The quality of mother's interaction with A would not indicate that that this experience would be greatly beneficial to A at this stage of his life". Looking to the future he went on to recommend that if placed outside of his parents care: "contact should be dictated by the quality of his placement, and directed by the permanency teams assessing A at that time. A's age, pre-existing relationship with his parents and the quality of the parent-child interaction would not indicate that direct contact would be indicated at this stage."

 

	 The Official Solicitor on behalf of the mother submitted that his client now supports the placement of A with her father and his partner, and that she has done nothing  to destabilize this, nor would she do so in the future. It was also argued that any future applications for a discharge of a special guardianship order would be unlikely because the mother would be extremely unlikely to be able to demonstrate sufficient change of circumstances to justify the grant of permission. With the extra safeguard of an order under s91(14) of the Children Act, it said that the circumstances of a secure and permanent placement can therefore be assured for A under a Special Guardianship order. 

 

	It is argued that  despite knowing where A lives the parents have refrained from attending at the grandparents home (I assume since March 2013), and that any risk of them doing so in future could be mitigated by the grandparents changing their address, or by injunctive relief. A contrast is drawn between the father's strong opposition to A's placement, and the mother's acceptance of the special guardianship order. Notwithstanding her marital relationship with the father, the Official Solicitor argues that his client is capable of making decisions independently of her spouse, citing the fact that she has continued her independent contact with A notwithstanding that the father has ceased attending as he said he would.  On behalf of A's mother it is therefore submitted that there is no valid reason why she should not be kept informed of A's school or any change in his surname in the future. Any risk that father may misuse his parental responsibility, could, it is argued, be adequately addressed by injunctive orders. 

 

	Although A's lifestory book will remind A of his biological relationship to his mother and father as well as his grandparents, concern is expressed on behalf of the mother that he will become 'confused and psychologically unsettled' by the knowledge that his grandfather and step grandmother have been made legally his parents, should they be able to adopt him. It is fairly argued that Special Guardianship Orders were introduced by the legislature to avoid the possibility of such 'skewed' family relationships, whilst providing a child with security within a kinship placement. It must be remembered that the severing of A's legal relationship with his parents does of course represents a draconian interference with his and their rights to a family life under Article 8 of the ECHR. It is argued that such interference would not be proportionate in the light of A's welfare needs, and that the making of an adoption order may even exacerbate the risk to his security, by exacerbating father's sense of unfairness and frustration. 

 

	On behalf of the Local Authority it is submitted that the test which must be applied when considering any application for an Adoption order, and the dispensation of the parents' consent to the making of such an order is that outlined in the case of re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] 2 FLR 625 . It is not a  question of whether adoption may be in the child's best interests, but rather whether his welfare requires more imperatively that his parents' consent to adoption should be dispensed with. Notwithstanding the positive recommendation of the independent social worker which the Local Authority does not seek to challenge, and the support of a Guardian whose long experience is not questioned, the Local Authority argues that it is not possible to say that A's welfare  demands his adoption by the applicants, and that such an order cannot be a proportionate response to his needs in the light of the range of alternative orders which might be made instead. Lastly in the light of the financial constraints to which Southend Borough Council in common with many other authorities are subject, it is also argued that there may be 'further challenge and expense' if mother's parental responsibility is sacrificed in the name of protecting A from his father. 

 

	As regards direct contact the Local Authority's position has changed during the course of these proceedings. Initially when the current Social Worker completed her Special Guardianship report in July 2013 she recommended that face to face contact between A and his mother would not be in A's best interests at that stage, and that letterbox contact twice yearly combined with A's life story book would be appropriate to secure A's sense of self and belonging. The concerns which she highlighted as informing that view, relate to the evidence that A has become subdued after contact with his mother, taking a day to return to his usual self, and to concern raised by the  Family Resource Centre where contact was taking place that contact is hindering A's development due to his mother's lack of emotional understanding of his needs and her inability to monitor her own emotional state or keep it in check. In this respect the observations of the Local Authority's Family resource centre were congruent with those expressed by Dr Derry. 

 

	However In paragraph 7.1  of her statement prepared on 10 January 2014 A's social worker proposed that direct contact between A and his mother should be facilitated and supervised by the Local Authority once every 6 months, under the auspices of a one year Family Assistance order should the parties consent, or if they do not consent then an order for direct contact order should be made. In this statement the view is expressed that mother poses no risk to A during contact sessions, that she has shown commitment to attending, and has not contested the making of a special Guardianship order. Since her husband has not tried to turn up at her contacts, it is argued there should be no risk to A from his father disrupting contact in the future either. 

 

	In Paragraph 13.5 of her statement the social worker indicates that the change in the Local Authority's position on the issue of direct contact has arisen due to what is seen as the increasingly difficult relationships between the mother and grandfather and his partner. On review, she states that this "does not leave the necessary room for consideration for contact which will be necessary for A to maintain a relationship with his mother and understand his identity". In response to concerns articulated by the independent social worker that the applicants will face being left on their own without  funding or the local authority's support in the future, to deal with conflicts in relation to contact or prospective Court applications, the social worker expressed the view in her statement that with everyone's consent, a 12 month family Assistance Order under s16(3)(b)might be made to support the family, in the event that a Special Guardianship Order is made. Although the Local Authority's duty under such an order would be limited to 'advising, assisting and befriending' A's social worker said in her oral evidence that the Local Authority might provide a contact venue and supervision under such an order for one year, but added that it was not part of any proposed special guardianship package to provide ongoing support for contact. I found it difficult to follow her analysis of why, when relations between the family were on a better footing no direct contact should have been considered in A's best interest, whereas when relations worsened, direct contact was considered to be of greater significance to his welfare. The Local Authority's written statements did not suggest that their recommendation for 'no direct contact' had sprung from the expectation that this would happen naturally by consent between the parties, rather it was positively argued that it was not in A's interest at this stage. However in her oral evidence A's social worker  said that the Local Authority's revised  recommendation in favour of direct contact was prompted by concern that direct contact between A and his mother may not  otherwise transpire consensually in the future without a Court order. On the other hand due to the evidence suggesting that direct contact has had an adverse impact upon A, his social worker considered that a frequency of twice a year would give him 'time to settle' between contacts. In cross examination it was fairly put to her that given the existing lack of attachment between A and his mother with weekly contact, she would effectively be a stranger to him, were he to be taken to see her at intervals of six months. However her response was that 'if a relationship is possible, it is desirable'. In the skeleton argument filed on behalf of the Applicants concern is expressed that the Local Authority's suggested 'support' for the grandparents and management of contact has been limited. Specifically although it was made clear to mother that she should not do so, she has continued to photograph and upload images of A onto the Facebook social networking site, which she has taken during contact. Notably on 28th January 2014 when she took three or four photos of A towards the end of contact she told staff that she " needed to take them so his daddy could see them". Meanwhile the agency used to supervise contact complained of having inadequate instruction from social workers as to the photography issue, and no member of the Local Authority team visited the grandparents to discuss the matter directly with them. Neither did they receive any response to their written requests for the local authority to undertake some social work with mother to establish some contact ground rules or to resolve the issue.

 
 
	A position statement prepared on behalf of the grandfather in November 2013 indicates that it is not mother's learning disability that leads him to make the application to adopt A, but the malevolent influence which the father holds over his daughter, and the inability of either parent to exercise their parental responsibility to A's benefit. Specifically it is argued that neither parent has been able to demonstrate an ability to contribute anything reasonable  and child focused on the issue of how his or her parental responsibility should be exercised, and whilst they continue to share Parental Responsibility the grandfather and his partner are afraid that A's well being and stability in their care will be adversely affected, not least by contact being used by the parents as a vehicle to raise more allegations, and create further conflict and anxiety. 

 

	In a position statement filed on behalf of the father also in November 2013 he not only voices his support for the mother's contact, but makes it clear that notwithstanding his withdrawal from the proceedings in March 2013 he ideally wishes to have weekly contact with his son, or at least some level of direct contact which will enable him to re-establish his relationship and enable A to grow up with the benefit of knowing both his parents. He makes his extreme opposition to any order which will allow the grandparents to care for his son plain, but indicates that he will not attend the hearing because he does not wish to be accused of making any threats or comments and due to the criminal proceedings which he links to what he describes as  their 'fraught relationship'. 

 

	It is the Applicants' belief, supported by the Guardian, that the suspended sentence which has been imposed upon the father, is having some impact in curbing his behaviour, but they have little faith this inhibition will endure when the operational period of the 18month suspended sentence expires. Neither do they share the Local Authority's optimism that his abstention from contact for the past year, portends an end to the likelihood of any future hostility. They point to the fact that his limited prospects of success did not inhibit him from issuing an application for a contact order as recently as 5th October 2013 either. 

 

	Even though a special Guardianship order would require the parents to seek leave under s14D(3) & (5) of the Children Act before being able to apply to vary or discharge the order, the applicants are concerned that even applications for permission will be unsettling for A particularly since his views may also have to be the subject of further professional enquiry as he grows older. Future applications for contact would not require prior leave to be sought by the parents automatically, but an order under s91 imposing such a requirement would also cause the Applicants the same concern. I accept that they would be likely to be aware of such applications for permission through the family grapevine, and more directly via communications from the parents, whether through social media or in direct contact sessions. So too the prospect of having to seek the parents' agreement or leave of the Court under s14C(3) for any change of name, or removal of A from the United Kingdom adds to the applicants concern. The prospective need to consult with the parents over other issues of parental responsibility such as changes of school, or provision of medical treatment for A also causes the Applicants anxiety. Whilst legally s14C may permit Special Guardians to exercise parental responsibility to the exclusion of any other person with parental responsibility, the Guardian's experience is that that in everyday life school teachers, medical practitioners, and police officers routinely assume there is an obligation to consult with a parent who retains parental responsibility, and that they are generally unfamiliar with the provisions of s14C or how a special guardianship order should operate. 

 

	The Applicants state that whilst the Local Authority perceives mother as essentially benign in her intentions, because she has indicated her support for the Applicants' care of A in these proceedings, they remain concerned that the Local Authority underestimates the influence which the father has over her behaviour. A recent example they cite arises from a letter sent on behalf of father on the day following his wife's contact with A in October 2013 when he alleged that the grandfather's partner had abused the mother by calling her 'a cunt'. The grandfather's partner denied having done any such thing, and noted that the mother herself only made the allegation after solicitors had written seeking clarification of whether she supported the father's claim or not. On 26th January this year the mother participated in a conversation on Facebook in which she asserted " Me and hubby are fighting for (A) to come back to us" whilst expressing the hope that he would be coming back in the following month. Of her father she wrote "I fucking hate him" and of his partner: " she's a bitch" and  she indicated that she not think it 'okay' for her son to be with them. I accept these remarks do not lie easily with the view advanced on her behalf that she is essentially supportive of A's placement and presents no threat to his stability. A's social worker ventured the suggestion that mother might want her son to return to her care in an ideal world, but in reality she knows it won't happen. In this context I consider it right to bear in mind, that whilst she is represented by the Official Solicitor, the decision whether or not to pursue any particular application is not exclusively hers to make, however that restraint will no longer apply at the conclusion of this litigation. It is also fair to observe that this would not be the first time there has been a dissonance between the case advanced by the mother to her representatives and to social workers, and that which she has espoused in private. Her deception in relation to her marriage is one previous example. 

 

	A's Guardian, refers in her report to father's unpredictability and his 'self-directed' as opposed to 'child-centred' application in October which she argues was motivated by his extreme resentment and dislike of the applicants. Importantly she also expresses the view that his dislike is fuelled by the mother's jealousy and resentment of the role that the grandfather's partner plays in her father's life. In her analysis the mother's feelings in turn fuel the father, and the couple have what she describes as "a reciprocal toxic relationship underpinned by jealousy, anger and resentment which is projected onto the grandparents". The last years' history of abusive and intimidating behaviour on their part leads the Guardian to suggest that in combination the parents have the capacity for continuing to generate unfounded but plausible allegations directed against the grandparents regarding their care of A, and that this has the potential throughout A's childhood to create disruption and distress for A as he grows older and more aware of his parents' actions. She predicts that any future contact between A and his mother  is likely to generate scenarios in which the mother will make complaints, which will, if she is still with the father, fuel his existing anger and resentment and lead to further  such incidents. 

 

	Since mother chose not to give any oral evidence, I did not have the opportunity to assess for myself precisely what influences may  have prompted her to make the remarks which she did on Facebook, and in the circumstances I consider there is all the more reason to accord weight to the Guardian's observations concerning the dynamics of the relationship between mother and father and the Applicants, since she has had longer exposure to all the protagonists in these proceedings than any other professional. Some indication of the mother's feelings in relation to her father and his partner was evident to me during the hearing, in that the mother responded to much of their oral evidence by rolling her eyeballs or sharing wry smiles with the social worker who sat nearest to her. 

 

	Another reason to prefer the analysis of Guardian  over that of A's social worker arises from the Guardian's decades of experience as both social worker and Guardian. In comparison A's social worker has been qualified for only one year. She was also unable to say how many times she had personally visited the applicants since last July, and remarkably conceded that she had not during the period of her allocation as A's social worker observed any occasions of contact at all. She accepted that the hostility in this case is unusual in that more commonly there is a level of co-operation between parents and special guardians of a child, although she also said this case was her first experience of special guardianship. It was put to her that  the risks to A are not so much about physical removal as they are to do with the constant undermining of his placement and the impact upon his carers of fielding the parents' hostility. In reply she  replied "Well if contact is managed, the risks can be managed".  This seemed to me to ignore the evidence of hostile allegations and complaints which have arisen both within and outside the context of contact. The reply also begged the question of who will be 'managing' those risks? and how? not just in 2014/15 but during the remainder of A's upbringing. When asked what in her view would justify adoption she replied that if the parents were challenging at contact or made any further significant threats, then adoption would be appropriate. In other words she identified adoption as protective measure, but in her view a premature one before the anticipated harm was actually done. 

 

	With regard to the important issue of whether A's identity is liable to become skewed by the effect of his grandfather becoming legally his father through adoption, the Applicants argue that this is unlikely to happen firstly because they do not seek to deny who A's mother and father are, they retain photographs around the house of all the family and through these, and A's lifestory books they envisage he will be well aware of his identity and background. They remain in regular contact with the mother's half brother, who visits them regularly, and are also in touch with the maternal grandmother and great grandmother. The grandfather's partner also detailed how they have included A's birth certificate and hospital bands in his lifestory book together with every card he has received from relatives and photos of his mother and father and extended family members

 

	Secondly having had his home with the applicants from birth, there is no dispute that A regards the applicants as his primary carers, however  the grandfather has always been referred to within the family as granddad and envisages this will continue to be the case whatever order is made. Since his partner shares no other blood relationship with A there is no other familial relationship which adoption might be likely to skew so far as she is concerned. Both the grandfather and his partner made it plain that they hope that at some stage in the future the mother will extricate herself from the relationship with father and play a part in A's family life. However they see no immediate prospects of this happening, and they regard her recent decision to marry him as evidence of his domination of her. 

 

	I was impressed by the warmth of emotion expressed by the grandfather's partner in relation to the mother whom she has known since she was a young teenager, and with whom she shared a common interest in horses. The distress which she showed during her oral evidence at the mother's apparent rejection of  her father and herself, seemed to me entirely genuine and unaffected. So too did the strength of her motivation to keep A safe and give him stability. She explained how if further applications were made, however unmerited they would feel vulnerable and insecure and unable to prevent the worry and uncertainty that A might be removed. She said "he is settled and a happy part of our family and we do not want that to change", adding that they would also be worried if he ceased to have any legal relationship with them at the age of eighteen because, as she put it "everyone needs to feel they are loved and belong somewhere, we just want him to grow up and be happy". She described the father (who had been admitted into their home and invited to family events as the mother's partner before A was born) as an extremely controlling man who has a say in all that mother says and does. She expressed her opinion that the mother is scared of him. When A was born she said they had offered to convert their dining room as a room for mother and A, and invited her to stay with the baby, but she did not want to, and stated that the father was 'her life'. She said mother's uncle and his wife made a similar offer which she also rejected. She accepted that this was the mother's choice and that they could not force her to make a decision. They had tried to make her see sense and prioritise A, but she would not. However she said that whilst she had never envisaged this happening whilst mother was pregnant, after a year as A's primary carer her priority is no longer the mother but A. She was nevertheless able to express creditable empathy for the mother saying that she felt bad for her: that having three children of her own she knows what it is like to be a Mum, that it would 'rip her heart out to lose a child', but she added "I would always put my children first". Now when she goes into town with the pram she says she remains vigilant, looking around more than usual and avoiding places where she thinks mother and father may be. She said she would love to relocate so that the father does not know where she lives and so that they might all feel safer and more secure without the risk he presents hanging over them. However at the moment she did not see it as a financial option, but hoped nonetheless to retain the possibility of doing so. She said she is 48 and had not expected to be in this position now that her own children are grown up, but that she did feel vulnerable. She conceded that the father may have little respect for any order that is made whether special guardianship or adoption, but said it would be safer for A to know that his father could not apply later to take him away. 

 

	With regard to contact the grandfather's partner noted that A does not cry when she hands him to the supervisor , he just adopts a glazed look. When she returns to collect him he becomes smiley again and jumps up and down. At home he will then become quite clingy wanting to be cuddled, and crying if she leaves the room. In contrast on a normal day he will be quite happy playing with his toys. She said she did not support direct contact, because her priority had always been to keep A safe, and that her position had never been any different. Whilst mother remained with father she did not envisage that would change. She said A is not a difficult baby, but even fortnightly contact with mother is upsetting for him and for her and she felt it unfair to put him in this position every six months, but would nevertheless comply with whatever the Court determined to be best for him, as she has done thus far 

 

	She said she will always tell A that she had a good relationship with the mother and that she was like another daughter to her. In response to any questions he may have as to why his mum could not look after him, she  said that she would tell A that his Mum loved and wanted him but wasn't able to look after him. If he wants more, she said she would try and give it to him, but would never talk in a negative way about the mother. As she put it: "she loves him, its just that she loves father more." 

 

	The grandfather's partner also said that her partner will always be A's grandfather whatever order is made. Her personal experience of being adopted by her mother's husband at the age of 7, and of calling her grandmother to whom she was close 'Mummy B' whilst always knowing that she was her grandmother, leads her to be confident that A will have little difficulty with names whatever their legal relationships are. She said he calls her either 'nanny' or 'mummy' interchangeably. With regard to changing A's name, the concerns of the grandparents are twofold: Firstly they are concerned that A's registered name  has saddled him with an  unfortunate acronym which is likely to be hurtful to him in later life. Secondly they are concerned that A's home and school will be easily traceable by the father during his upbringing unless they provide him with a new first and last name for formal registration purposes. They propose to retain his existing forenames and use 'A' everyday  even if it becomes his second name. It was submitted on behalf of the mother that the choice of name which had given rise to the unfortunate acronym had been an innocent mistake rather than deliberate act on the part of his parents. Either way, it does seem to me to be in A's interest for his names to be registered in such a way as will not cause him humiliation or distress as he is growing up. Since he will continue to be called A I do not think there is reason to believe he will be confused if his first and last names are formally  changed for registration purposes. I also consider on the evidence that details of that change should be withheld from his parents, whatever other orders I make, since it will enhance the security which he and his carers ought to be able to feel, that A's life is not under constant scrutiny and risk of disruption at the hands of his father. 

 

	It was the view of the Guardian that the applicants have had to put up with a series of incidents which can be considered unique for carers within the family, in her experience. She said she had been aware of the impact these incidents had had on the family over time and described it "absolutely awful for them". She was emphatic that it was unreasonable to expect any carer to have to tolerate this. She did not share the view that the mother can be relied on to exercise her judgment independently from her husband, since her learning difficulty makes it difficult for her to make independent judgments, and she is in thrall to her husband and will do what he thinks is the appropriate thing to do whatever it may be. She did not agree that a Special Guardianship Order would enable the applicants to manage that risk. She said she had wide experience as both an assessor and guardian in Special Guardianship order cases including in post Special Guardianship order cases where later contact applications have arisen, and so despite the dearth of research on the longer term impact of Special Guardianship orders she had some first hand experience of the impact of applications upon families who thought they had achieved permanence. 

 

	She described this as "a rare case" because in the majority of cases where kinship carers come forward, they may not be best pleased with the parents or may even be tense with them, but there is usually a level of consensus such that they are able to function with limited contact, whilst the Special Guardianship order offers both permanence as well as a wide range of identity contact with the birth family. However she emphasized it is usually premised upon permanence being 'a given', with goodwill on both sides and without undertones of mischievous activity. The focus of hostility towards the proposed carers by the parents, which is seen in this case, is not  normally found in Special Guardianship order cases. 

 

	She made it clear that it had been herself rather than the Applicants who had first raised the question of whether adoption was necessary to safeguard A's welfare throughout his life. She accepted that direct contact for identity purposes normally works reasonably well when a child has concrete memories and a knowledge of life within his birth family, typically where removal has taken place after the age of three years. Within contact each can draw on some shared experience, and provided the parent accepts the placement and does not disrupt it, direct contact will enhance the child's identity. In contrast the Guardian observed that identity contact rarely works well where a child of A's age has his primary attachment elsewhere, and where the child shows signs of being unsettled during contact with a parent who was not there enough in early life to enable the child to form any attachment to him or her. The Guardian had no criticism of the way in which the mother behaved towards A in the contact which she observed, but she said it was a fact that she failed to enable him to settle; yet within moments of the grandfather's partner re-appearing A was settled again, and clearly demonstrating his primary attachment to her. She considered that twice yearly contact to a person with whom A has no primary attachment and who is unable to make him feel settled or secure, runs the risk of unsettling A's sense of security with his carers. As he becomes more verbal he will potentially refuse to go. The more so if the mother is unable to screen in her mind what is an appropriate thing to say to him, and instead follows that which her husband tells her is appropriate. 

 

	At the present time the contact notes make it clear that the mother is keen to reinforce her own status as A's 'mummy'. This may not have  been inappropriate to date, but is likely to become increasingly confusing for A who is bound to regard the grandfather's partner as his mummy at least at an emotional level during his upbringing. In the Guardian's view to force a contact order on permanent carers in these circumstances would ordinarily be considered extreme, save perhaps in cases of implacable hostility. However she emphasized that this is not a case where A's carers can be described as implacable or unreasonably hostile, because their fears are grounded in the reality of their experience as to what father is capable of, and which induces in them and in the child what she described as an "aura of unpredictability". She considered that there is a realistic likelihood that in the longer term these applicants will be forced to return to Court with the consequential disruption of their family life. It is she opined entirely predictable now, and it sets them up for disruption and heartache. I think the Guardian is probably accurate when she observed that in enacting the Special Guardianship option the legislature will have expected there would be a reasonable level of co-operation between the relevant carers, otherwise one would not have expected them to have envisaged shared parental responsibility to be good thing for the children concerned. She opined that if it is necessary to hedge around a special guardianship order with specific issue orders, prohibited steps orders and s91 orders this of itself tends to indicate that a special Guardianship order is not right. This she said this is the first time she has made such a recommendation  in a family placement but she was emphatic that the facts in this case warrant the draconian step of adoption in the child's interests. The applicants in her view need the safety net of being able to disappear should they need to do so, and which they cannot do so long as parental responsibility is shared. Should the parents appear on the applicants doorstep, she also considers that an adoption order will help them to persuade a police constable that the parents are to be treated as legal strangers, which in reality may prove difficult for a constable to accept where parental responsibility is still shared. The Guardian considered it likely to benefit A if direct contact with his maternal grandmother and maternal great grandmother could be achieved. This is something the applicants have expressed their willingness to explore and they have written to maternal great grandmother and arranged contact to include these extended family members whilst the hearing has been part heard. This is notwithstanding their anxiety that the great grandmother might inform the mother of A's whereabouts and thus risk the father getting to know . The Guardian's advice that grandmother's house or the family resource centre might be considered a safe venue to begin with was a sensible approach to mitigating that anxiety, and I am pleased to note it has born fruit. 

 

	It has been the recommendation of the family centre, the Independent Social Worker, the Guardian and Dr Derry that direct contact is not likely to be in A's interest following the final hearing. The contact notes as well as the unchallenged professional evidence all make it clear that there is no significant attachment or bond between A and his mother and that he has become increasingly distressed and inconsolable at being left with her at a contact centre during this year, even though his mother has done nothing overtly detrimental to him. I think the Guardian is absolutely right in identifying that the mother has not been available for A in a consistent manner because of her own emotional neediness, and whilst contact may help to fulfill some of her emotional needs, it is doing little to cater for A's emotional or developmental needs

 

	In my judgment the evidence in this case is not just finely balanced but overwhelmingly indicative that an adoption rather than a special Guardianship order would better serve A's welfare and provide him with a more permanent and reliable degree of protection. I consider the threat of further applications to be entirely predictable in the light of the known history and I do not consider that a s91.14 order would provide the reassurance necessary to remove the spectre of this disruption from A's daily life. There is some force in the reservations expressed by the Guardian as to whether a  Special Guardianship Order hedged about with prohibited steps orders, specific issue orders or s91.14 inhibitions, does not call into question the wisdom of making the order in the first place. As she observed in her evidence: "If you circumvent all areas of concern what is the use of the parents retaining Parental Responsibility if they are unable to exercise it anyway?"

 

	Overall the evidence leaves me very far from reassured that the mother is presently capable of putting her son's needs before her own, or before her husband's needs and wishes. I accept as is submitted on behalf of the applicants that the parents do pose a significant and enduring threat to A's emotional welfare which will not be removed by the making of a Special Guardianship Order. The risk of harm emanates from the likelihood of ongoing litigation, and from harassment, allegations, or further complaints and inappropriate attempts to exercise Parental Responsibility on the part of his parents. In my Judgment the applicants are sensible reliable and caring people who can be trusted to do their utmost to both protect A's safety whilst also ensuring that his emotional welfare and identity within his family is appropriately nurtured. I have confidence that when and if mother is able to separate from father and chose her child over her need for her husband, that A's carers are likely to be amenable to including her within family gatherings of which A will be a part. I also consider that they are similarly well disposed to encourage A's contact with his uncle and with his maternal grandmother and great grandmother subject always and appropriately to safeguarding A from his father's interference. In all the circumstances, with my paramount consideration being A's welfare throughout his life, I am entirely satisfied in the unusual circumstances of this case, that an adoption order is a proportionate response to this child's needs, and that it is the only order which will truly provide the physical as well as emotional security which he needs to develop to his fullest potential in life. In these circumstances I will dispense with his parents consent since I am clear that A's welfare requires it. 

 

	I have carefully considered whether the making of a contact order would serve to enhance A's welfare, and I am satisfied in the light of the evidence from the family centre, from the independent social worker, from Dr Derry, from the Guardian and from my own reading of the contact notes, that direct contact with his mother is not presently serving to meet any emotional need of A, and that its' continuation risks causing harm to his emotional development and attachment to his primary carers, should they be compelled to continue facilitating this. I am not satisfied either that making an order for contact would be better for A than making no such order. The latter option would vest primary control where it should lie: in the hands of A's primary carers who have his best interests at heart. 

 

	Nevertheless I do recognize that the mother holds genuine feelings of affection for her son, even if they are not wholly reciprocated. Within the limits of his ability to understand this, I consider it will be helpful for him to experience a final farewell visit with his mother, the memory of which will be recorded and retained in A's life story book. To provide some continuum for A, reminding him as he grows older that his birth mother continued to hold him in mind, I also consider it will be helpful for A if his mother is afforded letterbox contact. Despite her learning disability mother is able to read and write, and I hope she will take the opportunity to send A written cards or letters with suitable photographs of herself  on up to two occasions each year for example at birthdays and Christmas. Whilst the Local Authority will not be involved in brokering this, I consider that sending such items via one of A's other extended family members such as his uncle should ensure that this is maintained even if the family move to a confidential address in the future. 

 

	If A wishes to send any reply I am confident that the grandfather and his partner will help him to do so, but it should remain in their discretion. So too they should retain the discretion as to the wisdom of providing the mother with any reciprocal note from themselves updating her about A's milestones in life, or his interests. Whilst this may very well assist the mother in knowing what to write back in a way which is relevant or interesting to A, I recognize also that the Applicants will wish to ensure that they do not in the process jeopardize the confidentiality which they will rightly wish to provide for A in order to preserve his security as part of their family throughout his childhood and on in to later life.

Judgement 19 March 2014 (following hearing on 13 March 2014)

	I am considering an application by birth parents for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order in relation to their child C aged two and a half years. The case has attracted widespread publicity because it was necessary for the court to make orders restraining the child's grandmother from using the internet to find the child and disrupt her new home. See Re B (A Child) reported on Bailii at [2014] EWCC B1 (Fam).

 

	The child was made the subject of Care and Placement Orders in the FPC on 23 May 2013. The parents did not oppose the orders. The maternal grandmother made an unsuccessful application for an order that the child live with her, an application which the parents then opposed. Appeals by the grandmother to myself in the County Court and then to the Court of Appeal were unsuccessful so the plan to place for adoption was approved.

 

	The child was placed with the proposed adopters on 5 September 2013 and they have now applied for an Adoption Order based upon the previous orders of the court. The reports establish that the child is now very settled in a successful placement. Adoption will follow unless the parents successfully oppose the proceedings. Notice of the proceedings has been duly given to the parents and on the day prior to the hearing they contacted the court by email.

 

	They explained that they wished to oppose but could not afford to travel to court. The court staff contacted me and at my request asked if the parents wanted an adjournment or preferred to participate in the hearing by telephone. They were told I needed to know if anything had changed since May 2013. As a result I received two emails containing their responses and a request to participate by telephone.

 

	When the hearing commenced the parents were contacted and played a full part in the hearing by telephone, expanding on their written account.

 

	Because the plan for adoption had been established by the previous court orders, sections 47(5) and (7) Adoption and Children Act 2002 provide that the parents need the court's leave to oppose the proceedings and that the court must first be satisfied that there has been a change of circumstances since the Placement Order was made. I have followed the guidance of the Court of Appeal in the case of Re P [2007] EWCA Civ 616. The test should not be set too high but the change must be of a nature and degree sufficient, on the facts of the particular case, to open the door to a second stage comprising judicial evaluation whether leave to oppose should be given.

 

	The material available to me fails to establish the necessary change of circumstances. As the parents were unrepresented, I pressed them to give details of changes since May 2013. The changes are:-

 

•    The removal of the parents 75 miles from their original home;
•    An improved relationship with the grandmother following removal from her town, conducted now largely by telephone. They had discussed today's hearing with her. Her circumstances were said to be unchanged;
•    The establishment of a two bedroom home;
•    Employment;
•    The mother's presence on a waiting list for psychological therapy;
•    A late change of heart to now oppose adoption and support the grandmother as a potential carer.

	Otherwise the evidence provided by the parents comprised the repetition of issues on which they were disappointed in the 2013 proceeding. They also complained how they have been treated. In at least one respect the complaints are justified. In the Court of Appeal McFarlane LJ was very critical of the local authority for placing the child while the grandmother's appeal was pending and for misleading the family when an encounter with the proposed adopters was permitted. However the appeal failed and these criticisms cannot have relevance to my task today.

 

	I conclude that the changes claimed by the parents are not relevant to the case against them. The important bases of the Placement Order were:-

 


A volatile relationship between the parents, with domestic violence;



The mother's inability to care for the child, established by an unsuccessful period in a mother and baby foster home where the foster mother was forced to take over the care of the baby;



A psychological assessment of the mother recommending therapy for up to 2 years to address a poor attachment history arising from her dysfunctional family life. Only this would allow her to develop parenting skills;



The grandmother provided poor parenting for the mother and continued to control her and undermine her. There was no strong attachment between the baby and her grandmother.



	In this context I am driven to the conclusion that the first stage test of a sufficient change of circumstances is not met. As a check I have asked myself how the parents would fare if a change of circumstances did take the application into the second stage. The familiar test from Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 would not be satisfied as these circumstances could not provide the necessary solid grounds for a successful challenge to adoption.

 

	The parents' application for leave to oppose the making of an adoption order must be dismissed. Any challenge by application for leave to appeal must be lodged at the Court of Appeal in London by 4pm on 9 April 2014. The case will be relisted before me at 10am on 16 April 2014 to consider the granting of the adoption order.

Her Honour Judge Hudson :  These care proceedings concern two young girls, AIA born on [a date in] 2009 (now nearly four years and eleven months) and ARA born on [a date in]  2011 (aged two years and five months).  They are the children of R and MA, who share parental responsibility for them.  The care proceedings were issued on 5th June 2013 following extensive involvement of the local authority, Newcastle City Council, and health and other professionals in relation to the children's feeding, health and wellbeing in the care of their parents.  

 



On 4th July 2013, following a contested interim hearing, the District Judge made interim care orders and approved an interim care plan of placement of the two girls in foster care.  The children have since been placed together with local authority foster carers and have had supervised contact with their parents four times each week.

 



The District Judge also gave case management directions, including the instruction of Dr Kate Ward, a consultant paediatrician, to undertake a paediatric assessment of the children.  The parents were directed at that hearing to identify any alternative carers, with further directions for a viability assessment of any such carers to be undertaken.  The local authority duly assessed MAK (MA's sister) and her husband, MS.  The assessment was completed on 28th August 2013 but did not support placement or further assessment.  No further steps were taken by them in relation to this assessment.

 



The case was then timetabled to an issues resolution hearing in the week of 4th November 2013.  It was then re-timetabled in October 2013, it appears to accommodate the delayed filing of Dr Ward's report.  The case first came before me on 29th November 2013 for an issues resolution hearing, less than one week before the expiry of the twenty six week track which had been set for the case.  

 



The local authority was seeking final care orders with care plans of adoption.  The local authority had issued placement applications to be determined at the conclusion of the care proceedings.  The position of the parents at that hearing was far from clear.  Then, as throughout the local authority's involvement and now, the parents were presenting as a couple.  In these circumstances it was troubling to find that the mother's case was that she conceded the threshold criteria were established and that she and the father could not care for the children.  In contrast, the father was disputing the threshold criteria and proposing himself and his wife as joint carers.  The children's guardian, Aileen Firth, had filed reports in the care and placement applications, indicating her support for the local authority's applications.  

 



The parents were accompanied at that hearing by a maternal uncle and aunt of the mother, MY, and his wife, SA.  They were putting themselves forward as carers for the children and seeking assessment.  It appears that they had been unaware of the children's situation until early November 2013.  

 



At the hearing before me on 29th November 2013, it was unclear, however, what they were proposing in terms of the care of the children and the involvement of the parents or otherwise in any such arrangement.  At that stage they had only limited information about the children's history and their assessed needs.  

 



The local authority was quite properly agreeing to undertake an assessment of MY and SA, in circumstances in which their plan for the children otherwise was placement of the children for adoption.  I therefore gave directions for an agreed list of relevant reports to be disclosed to MY and his wife and timetabled the case to a final hearing on 17th February 2014.  

 



In the light of the lack of clarity in relation to the parents position, both in relation to threshold and their proposals for the care of the children, I listed an adjourned issues resolution hearing on 20th December 2013, with a view to ensuring that there was as much clarity as could be achieved as to the issues to be determined at the final hearing.  Position statements filed by the parents before the adjourned issues resolution hearing confirmed they each supported the plan for the children to be placed with the Ys

 



The mother's position statement (at A109) stated her acceptance that she and the father could not care for the children and her 'delight and relief', as she described it, that the Ys were putting themselves forward.  The mother proposed that the children should move to the Ys, following which there would need to be a period for the children 'to transfer the good eating behaviour and to ensure that this is firmly in place before re-introducing her into the same household'.  It was then her proposal that she would live with the Ys, but that the Ys would be the children's carers.

 



The father's position statement (at A113) confirmed this position - for the mother to move in once the children were ready and settled with the Ys and following guidance from professionals.  He stated his intention to move in with the Ys once his business and home affairs were sorted in the North East of England and when the family were ready.  

 



The parents each confirmed the threshold criteria were conceded, accepting the majority of the local authority's findings, both in relation to threshold and the further schedule of findings which the local authority had filed in relation to welfare.  It was confirmed at that issues resolution and on behalf of the parents that Dr Ward was not required for cross examination, although further questions were to be put to her.

 



By an application dated 24th January 2014, however, the solicitor for the mother sought a direction for Dr Ward's attendance at the forthcoming final hearing.  In the light of this a directions hearing took place before me on 6th February 2014.  

 



In addition to the issue of Dr Ward's attendance or otherwise, a position statement which was filed by the children's guardian cast further doubt over the case which was being put by the family.  The guardian's understanding was that the Ys were putting themselves forward as short term carers only, with a view to 'training' the mother to care for the children.  The guardian recorded her account of meetings with the parents only a matter of days before her position statement was filed, in which she said they each were stating their wish to care for the children and that they envisaged that they would do so.  

 



In the light of the continuing uncertainty about the case being put by the family, I directed that Dr Ward should give oral evidence if that could be achieved at such short notice.  I also directed further statements to be filed by the parents and by Mr and Mrs Y, if they wish to do so, to clarify the position if possible.

 



The mother's statement confirmed that she had told the children's guardian she wanted to care for the children, but accepted that that was not realistic and that she could not do so.  Her position statement confirmed she supported the proposed placement with the Ys, although she intended to live with them and therefore separately from the father.  The father's statement stated his position that the Ys would be the children's carers, but that he and his wife would want to live together and with the children.  

 



A statement was filed from MY which stated that he and his wife would like the mother to learn from them, and that he envisaged that the parents may have more of a parental relationship in time.  He said that he and his wife would care for the children so long as necessary.  In his statement he agreed that the children may need a settling in period without their mother in the household.  His statement recorded his position and that of the family: that it would not be culturally appropriate for them to care for the children without their mother being in the same household.

 



The case came before me for final hearing on 17th February 2014.  At that hearing the mother was represented by Mr Gray for the first time; the father was represented by Miss Wood, as he had been at all of the hearings before me.  Both parents were assisted throughout the hearing by interpreters.  MY and SA were also present during the hearing.  I was told at the outset that the family were putting forward a united case: that placement of the children should be with the Ys with the mother living in their home with them.

 



During the course of the hearing I heard evidence from Dr Kate Ward. I express particular thanks to her for making herself available at short notice and in what I know to be difficult circumstances.  I heard evidence from two social workers, Melanie Kennedy, who was the allocated social worker for the girls until December 2013, and   from Laura Sim, the currently allocated social worker who became involved in November 2013.  I heard evidence from MY, from RA, MA and the children's guardian.  

 



None of the other witnesses who had filed statements were required.  SA was available to give evidence, but confirmed that she agreed with her husband's evidence.  No-one required her to give oral evidence in those circumstances.  

 



I heard the evidence and submissions over five days (apart from the time taken during my court list for other short appointments).  I give judgment today, 24th February 2014, the next working day.  

 



As I turn to the background of the proceedings I should record that this is not a case in which there are many significant factual disputes of relevance.  Insofar as I make any findings of fact, it is for the party making an allegation to prove it, and I determine all factual disputes on the simple balance of probabilities.

 



The family are Pakistani Muslims.  The mother is aged thirty six; the father aged thirty.  He was previously married and lived with his first wife in the North East of England.  That marriage ended in divorce.  He travelled to Pakistan for an arranged marriage with the mother in 2007.  They came together to the United Kingdom in 2008.  It is evident from the documentary evidence and from the oral evidence I heard from the parents, that they each have their own limitations.  I will return to this issue shortly.  

 



MY is sixty three; his wife, SA, is fifty seven.  They live in Glasgow.  MY is the most senior family member in the United Kingdom, and is therefore the head of the family in this country.  He and his wife have successfully raised their own children and are now grandparents.  MY is now retired from running a successful business in Glasgow, which he describes in his statement as being a general store.  

 



AI was born on 27th March 2009 at thirty two weeks gestation, weighing only 1.18kg and therefore below the 0.4th centile. She remained in hospital until 13th May 2009.  There were concerns about the family circumstances before her discharge from hospital, which resulted in a higher level of support and monitoring than usual following AI's discharge.  This included the involvement of health and other professional supports.  There were concerns in relation to AI's feeding and poor weight gain from an early stage.  There were also concerns about her general development.  The mother was considered to be suffering from depression.  AI had a period of in-patient assessment following which she was discharged home with a nasogastric tube.  The in-patient assessment identified further concerns about the parent's interaction with AI and their ability to care for and feed her.  She was fed by a nasogastric tube for a period of months between July and November 2010.  

 



The family then spent a period with extended family in Glasgow, returning to Newcastle after some time, following which concerns about AI's weight and development once again were apparent.  The parenting assessment at C15 records the resources which were provided to the family at the time.

 



The view of the professionals at the time was that the parents were not complying with the advice that they were given.  AI was losing weight.  As a result, a referral from the consultant paediatrician to children's services led to an initial assessment in February 2011.  That initial assessment led to a core assessment. The core assessment identified a lack of weight gain associated with feeding difficulties and a lack of routine or encouragement in feeding.  The impact of the mother's mental health and her depression was also considered to be relevant.  The core assessment led to a complex child in need plan.  This did not achieve the desired progress, as a result of which a planning meeting was held and a strategy meeting convened on 31st May 2011.  This in turn led to a section 47 enquiry and a child protection conference being convened.  

 



The child protection conference took place on 21st June 2011, when AI was made subject to a child protection plan.  This included a more significant role for workers from the charity Children North East (whose involvement had started in August 2010) to assist in developing appropriate meal time routines.  A child protection review on 30th August 2011 continued the child protection plan in respect of AI and also made the then unborn baby subject to a child protection plan.  AR was born on the following month/, on 13th September 2011.

 



Child protection reviews were held on 8th November 2011, 14th March 2012, 10th December 2012 and 20th May 2013.  Support was provided to the family by a range of services: health visitor, growth and nutrition service, Children North East and social care.  Nursery placements were also available for the children, together with weekly play sessions in their family home facilitated by a nursery nurse.  This monitoring and support was not possible over a two month period between November 2011 and January 2012 when the family were in Pakistan.  

 



The local authority was quite properly alive to questions about the parents functioning and the need to ensure that services provided to the family were appropriate, and that work undertaken was done in a way which gave the best prospect of success in terms of the parent's engagement and response to it.  The local authority therefore instructed Dr Shawn Mosher, a clinical psychologist with a particular interest in learning disability and the parenting abilities of those with learning disabilities, to undertake an assessment of the parents and to advise in relation to the impact of their difficulties on their parenting and the supports which may improve their parenting.  

 



Dr Mosher's report is dated 15th August 2012 (at E1).  His conclusions are summarised at E3 paragraph 2 in the following terms:

 

Mr A may be clinically depressed as a consequence of his serious health problems.  Mrs A has a history of recurrent depression.  Although there is some low mood and anxiety now, this is not at clinically significant levels.  Mr A has a mild degree of learning disability that will affect his ability to care for the children without support.  Mrs A probably functions in the lower end of the low average range of cognitive ability.  The parents would benefit from alterations to usual modes of information delivery, including more visual materials, reduced use of specialist language and offering opportunities for repetition.  It would be best if workers assumed that both parties had a degree of learning disability.  Mrs A's parenting ability significantly outstripped those of her husband notwithstanding his evident love for his daughters.  Their respective parenting skills will probably be best manifested in the context of their marriage.  Their abilities together are probably better than if they were apart.  

That is dealt with further in paragraphs 8.21 to 8.23.  Dr Mosher reported that the parents' understanding and acceptance of the local authority concerns is poor.  That is dealt with further at paragraphs 8.24 to 8.26 in his report.



I am satisfied that the work which was undertaken following this assessment was done in accordance with the recommendations of Dr Mosher.  The approach is set out in the parenting assessment at C20.  Very considerable supports were provided by the local authority, which are set out at C20 to 21.  

 



Dr Paula Drummond, consultant paediatrician, took over responsibility for AI's care in 2012.  Despite the parents' accounts that AI was eating well, Dr Drummond had continuing concerns about her weight and developmental delay, which increased as time went on. Investigations excluded any underlying pathology causing her poor growth.  A food diary indicated that, in fact, AI was chronically under nourished.

 



Melanie Kennedy was allocated as the social worker for the girls in October 2012.  In her evidence she described her shock at AI's physical presentation when she first became involved.  She said apart from the obvious concern in relation to her weight, AI appeared frail.  She often had cracked lips and dark sunken eyes.  During her visits to the home, AI was lethargic, generally lying on the sofa with no energy and complaining of pains in her legs and arms.  AR was seen to be very clingy and reluctant to engage.  

 



The professional concern for the children's wellbeing was such that a series of meetings were held to consider the children's future.  A professionals meeting took place on 8th March 2013, followed by a legal planning meeting on 11th March 2013.  A pre-proceedings meeting was held in April 2013, followed by a Child Protection review on 20th May 2013.  

 



It is clear from what I have said that the focus of the concern was on AI.  The local authority's parenting assessment was completed in May 2013 and identified the following issues at C22-23, despite the supports which were then in place:  

 

•    AI's poor weight gain and associated poor physical health;

•    The long term impact of AI's lack of nutritional intake will have upon her physical and developmental wellbeing;

•    The parents' insight into their children's need and AI's special needs given her developmental delay;

•    The validity of the information provided by the parents in terms of the quantities of food eaten by AI is questionable, but does not reflect her weight gain; 

•    Parents inappropriate methods used to feed AI; 

•    Parents' acceptance and understanding of the concern of professionals;

•    Parents' ability to consistently and adequately follow the advice offered by professionals in terms of feeding and suggestions made by health professionals;

•    Parents' ability to instil boundaries and exercise control over the children and their inability to follow professional's advice in relation to this;

•    AR was observed to be eating less and could be picking up on AI's eating patterns;  

•    RA's anxieties and the impact this is having upon the children; 

Given the extent of these concerns, a grave outcome was contemplated for AI if the necessary changes were not made.  In the light of the lack of progress achieved during the two year period of involvement of the local authority, legal action was then considered necessary by all professionals involved in the care of the children.



The care proceedings were the issued with a plan of placement of AI in foster care.  By the time of the interim care hearing, however, the local authority's concerns in relation to AR had increased, so that her removal was also proposed.  The basis for this was set out in Melanie Kennedy's statement dated 25th June 2013.  In summary, AR's weight and development was an increasing cause for concern, as was her presentation.

 



At the contested interim hearing, the District Judge heard evidence from Dr Drummond, the health visitor, Melanie Kennedy, Tracy Welsh (from Children North East), Barbara Kaur (from the Angelou Centre) and from the parents.  The Angelou Centre has provided support to the parents since the proceedings commenced.

 



Following the making of interim care orders, AI and AR moved to the care of ST and TH, local authority foster carers of Pakistani Muslim heritage.  The children have remained in their care since.  Both AI and AR have made very good progress into all areas of their development since their placement in foster care.  They nonetheless continue to present with developmental delay and are likely to need additional supports to reach their potential.  

 



Following completion of the local authority parenting assessment, further parenting work has continued to be undertaken by Children North East with Bernadette Brown and with the assistance of the Angelou Centre with Barbara Kaur.  Bernadette Brown was involved from May 2013 and has supervised contact since the children were accommodated.  A statement was filed by the local authority by Bernadette Brown dated 8th November 2013 in which she recalls the warmth which is evident of contract between the children and their parents.  

 



In her conclusion at C114-115, Bernadette Brown said as follows:

 

It is my professional opinion based on the work that I have completed with both parents to date, that both MA and RA have struggled to meet the physical, emotional and educational demands and needs of their children.  However I have observed both parents showing a willingness and ability to make positive changes in respect of their children.  Both parents interact with the children at an appropriate level most of the time, and they have worked hard to understand and meet the needs of their children prior and during contact.  Therefore I recommend that within an intensive tailor package of support in place to meet the appropriate needs of the family then they could be reunited.



Dr Ward's assessment report was completed on 8th November 2013.  It is a lengthy and detailed report in which she reviews the children's medical history in the context of their family circumstances.  She also had the opportunity of seeing the children and examining them at the foster carer's home.  From E103 she summarises the relevant medical history in relation to AI.  At E112-114 she answers a serious of questions in relation to AI's historical and current difficulties and her future care needs.  At E115 she summarised her findings in relation to AI in the following terms:

 

AI is a small slim girl with a small head circumference.  Review of her chronology reveals a history of severe failure to thrive.  AI also has evidence of developmental delay.  Whilst genetic factors and a history of prematurely and low birth weight are likely to have contributed to her small stature and developmental delay, environmental factors and parenting difficulties are more likely than not to have impacted on her feeding, faltering growth and development.  AI is a girl who requires more than good enough care with consistent positive parenting and good levels of stimulation if she is to achieve her potential in terms of physical, emotional and cognitive developments.



In relation to AR, Dr Ward's review of her medical records is summarised from E133.  She answers specific questions in relation to AR from E137-141.  She identified AR as having insecure attachments.  Her conclusions in relation to AR are summarised at E141 as follows:

 

AR has lived in an environment where her parents have struggled to provide consistent care and routines in terms of feeding, language and play skills.  AR is a small child who displays some delay in her language and play skills.  This may reflect multi-factorial issues such as genetic factors affecting growth and development but importantly also the environment in which she has lived.  The improvement in her development and self confidence and also an upturn in growth velocity support environmental factors as a cause of her difficulties.  AR needs to live in an environment where there is consistency of care, routines and boundaries and a good level of stimulation.  It is essential that carers are able to work in partnership with professionals to ensure that her needs are met.



Dr Ward addressed the further supports and care needs of the children.  In the case of AI, she listed the resources she anticipated would be required at E115: a community paediatrician to monitor growth and development and to act as a co-ordinator of health input; a dietician to provide advice and support to carers in managing AI's nutritional needs and feeding; speech and language therapist providing monitoring; therapeutic input; advice to school and carers regarding communication skills,  hearing and vision (recommending AI's hearing and vision are tested as deficits and sensory input can impact on cognitive and language development); treatment by a community dentist, as AI had evidence of dental caries and poor dental hygiene.  She described dental caries as an infectious disease which reflects diet, dental hygiene and dental care.  She considered that the involvement of CAMHS or the clinical psychology service maybe required in the future, with AI benefiting from therapeutic input to address her feeding difficulties and helping her to come to term with her life experiences.  

 



In relation to AR, Dr Ward identified her care needs in a series of bullet points at E141: routine input from a general practitioner and dental services; assessment by an ENT surgeon in relation to nasal congestion; she, recommended testing of vision; she contemplated the prospect that a future involvement from the CAMHS team may be required in respect of her insecure attachments.

 



The local authority arranged a decision making conference on 12th November 2013.  In the days before the meeting, the local authority was informed through Barbara Kaur of family members within the extended family in Glasgow who may be in a position to provide care for the children.  These family members had not been identified by the parents earlier in the proceedings.  Initial enquiries in relation to the mother's sister and her brother did not progress.  On 11th November 2013, however, the social workers were contacted by MY, who had travelled to Newcastle with his son. At his request, a meeting took place that day between them and Melanie Kennedy and her team manager (Rachael Sinclair).  During the meeting MY informed them that there were no family members who could care for the children but offered the family's support for placement with the parents, by visiting the children every two to three weeks from Glasgow.  

 



MY was not present at the decision making conference on 12th November 2013, visiting only for the day on the 11th November 2013. A letter from him was, however, provided to the independent reviewing officer by Barbara Kaur, apparently at the end of the meeting, in which he offered two proposals: that the mother and children would live with the Ys for three months; and, secondly, the children would return to their parents, with extended family visiting at weekends.  

 



The minutes of the decision making conference record the views of those present: that the parents were not able to meet the children's needs; there were not the supports or resources which could make up the shortcomings in parenting so that the children would be cared for to a good enough standard; and that the proposals for family support would not provide the necessary care for the children to make up for the parents shortcomings.  The meeting concluded that a plan of adoption should be pursued.  

 



The local authority's final statement of Melanie Kennedy set out the local authority's reasoning.  She also filed a balance sheet analysis of the placement options that had been considered by the local authority.  She was the author of the final care plans.  

 



By the time of the issues resolution hearing on 29th November 2013, the mother's solicitor had filed a statement from MY, asking that his family be assessed to care for the children.  At the hearing the nature of the proposal was unclear as to the extent to which the Ys consider that the parents would be part of the children's care arrangements.  It was therefore agreed between the parties and approved by me, that to allow the Ys a better understanding of the issues, the children's needs and identified difficulties of the parents, the reports of Dr Mosher, Dr Ward, and the children's guardian should be disclosed to them in advance of the assessment sessions which were to be undertaken by the social worker.  The assessment sessions were planned over the following weeks to give the Ys time to assimilate the issues in the case, and the reports which had been made available to them.  

 



The change in social work responsibility coincided with these events, as Melanie Kennedy had taken up a position as a team manager.  Laura Sim had been involved from November 2013, co-working the case with Melanie Kennedy for the month before she took over responsibility.  They both met the Ys at the issues resolution hearing on 29th November 2013.  To accommodate the Ys' circumstances and to reflect the changing social work involvement, the local authority arranged the following sessions by way of assessment: a session on 11th December 2013 in Glasgow, undertaken by Laura Sim and the team manager Rachael Sinclair; a session on 7th January 2014 when the Ys came to Newcastle and had contact with the children and a further session with Laura Sim; and, finally, an assessment session on 14th January 2014 in Glasgow undertaken by Laura Sim and Melanie Kennedy.  The children's guardian visited the Ys on 26th January 2014 in Glasgow.  

 



The statement of Laura Sim dated 21st January 2014 contains the local authority's assessment of the Ys.  The Ys successfully parented their own family, as well as running a successful business.  They live clearly in comfortable surroundings in Glasgow.  

 



Throughout the sessions the Ys proposed that they would have an advisory role as they described it in "training" the mother to care for the children.  In the course of the meetings with the social workers, the Ys were clear that they did not see themselves providing sole care themselves, in the light of their age and circumstances. 

 



The Ys offered a period of three to six months during which the mother would live with them and they would train her.  They told the social workers that if she was not then able to care, the Ys would accept the position.  The evidence of the social workers, which was not challenged, was that they encouraged and hoped the Ys would over time accept the need for greater involvement and offer themselves as long term carers for the children.  In fact, the Ys reported this to the children's guardian when she visited on 26th January 2014.  At paragraph 13 of the guardian's position statement (at E158), she reported the Ys saying that they did not think it would work if they took the children themselves permanently, as the mother would wish to care for them herself, and she and her family would constantly be in communication with them or demanding to see the children.

 



It was within about a week of this that the guardian reported that the parents had each told her that they continued to see to care for the children.  At the hearing before me on 6th January 2014, it was suggested that the guardian had misunderstood their position.  The statements which were then filed confirmed the parents support for the Ys.  Barbara Kaur had filed a statement on behalf of the mother, dated 12th December 2013, which supported placement of the children with the Ys.  At C162 she recommended that the family be rehabilitated together in the Ys' property, 'only at a level that is right for the children so as not to be rushed so they do not have any decline'.

 



On the first day of the final hearing, the Ys proposed for the first time that they would offer long term care for the children.  A statement from MY dated 17th February 2014 set out this position, which was apparently circulated to the parties on Friday 14th February 2014 by the mother's solicitor.  It was clear from the representations that were made to me at the start of the hearing on 17th February 2014 that the local authority and children's guardian were still keen to explore precisely what the Ys were proposing, and whether the local authority and/or the guardian considered their offer of long term care an arrangement that could provide for the girls' future needs.  I was very mindful of the finality and draconian nature of the order sought by the local authority and agreed to give time for the position to be clarified.  

 



The position of the local authority and the children's guardian was that an arrangement whereby the mother was within the household (and therefore necessarily involved in the children's care) would not be acceptable, because of the impact of her presence on the children's development.  The position of the Ys, as clarified and confirmed, was that they would only offer to care for the children with the mother in the household.  They argued that that would be culturally appropriate, and she would also provide assistance with the household chores.  In these circumstances it was clear that there was no consensus and the case commenced.  

 



Laura Sim gave evidence first. Her evidence was not completed on the first day and so Dr Ward's evidence was interposed at the start of the second day.  Laura Sim then completed her evidence followed by Melanie Kennedy.  It is most appropriate in these circumstances to deal with the evidence of Dr Ward first.  She emphasised the breadth of the issues involved in non-organic failure to thrive - apart from the provision of inadequate calories, the important psychological factors.  She also highlighted the evidence of attachment difficulties between the children and their parents and the issues relating to the children's overall wellbeing.  She described enormous efforts in the past to address the feeding difficulties and the limited progress made by the parents with the children.  She stressed that the work undertaken by the foster carer to improve the children's eating patterns. She considered it probable that the parents' involvement in day to day care would lead to a recurrence of the previous behaviour.  She described such feeding difficulties as an extremely complex issue.  She said aversive patterns of feeding are one of the most difficult problems to deal with.

 



Dr Ward envisaged difficulties in managing the proposed arrangement of the mother living within the Y family.  She did not consider the mother having a passive role to be realistic, in the light of the mother's own wish to parent.  She further considered that, if it could be achieved, it would be confusing for the children to have their mother excluded from areas of their care in this way.  She noted that the ages of the children are such that their own wish for interaction with their mother would make the situation unworkable.  She said that the children have attachments to their parents, even if disordered, in contrast with the very limited relationship she understood them to have with the Ys.  

 



Dr Ward was asked by Mr Gray (on behalf of the mother) about the likely success if the mother was out of the house for a period of months to allow the children to settle and establish themselves with the Ys.  Dr Ward remained cautious and pessimistic.  She said that the attachments to the Ys would still be likely to be tenuous at that stage.  She was concerned about the impact on the children of re-introducing the mother and the risk that any progress would then falter.

 



Dr Ward agreed that the children had made good progress in foster care.  She attributed it to the quality of care.  She said that the progress in foster care indicated the multi-factorial nature of the difficulties and the importance of the children's environment in meeting their needs.  She considered that long term high quality care would be needed by the children to maintain their positive progress.

 



Laura Sim and Melanie Kennedy both said that Dr Ward's evidence had strengthened their view that a placement of the children with the Ys whilst their mother was in the household would be unworkable and not in the children's best interests.  Laura Sim gave evidence of AI's continuing anxiety about medical treatment and her need for reassurance that she is well.  In contrast, Laura Sim said that the mother remains very anxious about AI's health and about feeding, which causes her to raise issues about AI's health and development.  These children had a history of repeated and frequent attendance at the doctor while in the care of the parents, which has not been necessary since their accommodation.

 



Melanie Kennedy gave evidence of the change she has seen to the children since their accommodation   She said Dr Ward's evidence had emphasised the long journey to recovery for the children to overcome the inadequacies of the care by the parents in terms of their emotional and psychological harm as well as their physical harm.  Despite the progress they have made, Melanie Kennedy said it would be na�ve to say the children have overcome their early life experiences.

 



Both Laura Sim and Melanie Kennedy said they had hoped the Ys would accept the mother's limitations, but in their opinion the Ys do not grasp the extent of her difficulties.  Melanie Kennedy said she felt that MY lacked depth and understanding of how the mother's limitations impacted on her parenting and her parenting responses.  During her discussions with MY, he described the mother as bright, a good cook, and a good sewer.  

 



Having heard this evidence, I was very interested to hear the evidence of MY and the parents to get an understanding of what they were each saying, against the background of the confused and changing positions.  As have all those who have had dealings with him in relation to this case, I found MY to be pleasant, co-operative and personable.  I do not question his and his wife's parenting abilities and the care they have given to their children and grandchildren.  

 



I found there to be a theme throughout MY's evidence of his confidence that RA would be in a position to resume the care of the children, and within a relatively short timescale.  He spoke of the children growing and maturing like normal children and for their mother then to play a normal role.  He said he thought with motherly and fatherly affection there "is absolutely no reason" why she would not get to a stage where she could look after the children herself.  When asked about his proposal of three to six months he said "I am still of the opinion that these matters can resolve in about six months or so", although he added it could take longer than he originally thought.

 



MY did not envisage any difficulties within the household, either with the mother wanting a role she should not have, or with the children wanting their mother to be involved in such way.  He explained the cultural requirement for their mother to be in the home as he said otherwise there would be talk in the community, that they had taken advantage of the mother and taken the children away from her.  From the evidence that he gave, it was evidence that the Ys have had quite limited contact with the girls to date so that any relationship with them is tenuous at best at this stage.

 



MY was clear that his preference was for the mother to join their household at the same time as the children.  The longest period he would contemplate for the children to be in their care without their mother was a few weeks only.  MY was also clear in his evidence that he did not envisage the father living as part of his household.  

 



When RA gave evidence she initially agreed with the response to the threshold findings when they were put to her in examination in chief, and her acceptance that she could not care for the children.  She said she agreed to the Ys caring for the children, but saw her role as making meals for the children, but not otherwise undertaking the immediate caring task for them.  Within a short time, however, her evidence changed, in that she said that she believes she is capable of caring for the children, but she is accepting the views of professionals that she isn't. 

 



In cross examination, RA said the children's problems weren't anything to do with the way that she and MA cared for the children.  She said she believes she is now able to care for them.  She said that she hoped that she and MA would care for the children together in the future.  

 



MA then gave evidence in chief very briefly.  No party sought to cross examine him.  The difficulties which were identified by Dr Mosher were evident from the brief evidence he gave.  The parents remain committed to their relationship which appears to be mutually supportive as well as enduring.  

 



The children's guardian's evidence was given following the evidence of the family members.  She said she did not consider the plan of placement with the Ys with their mother to be workable.  She said she was of this view in the light of Dr Ward's evidence about the children's needs and the evidence of the Ys and the parents of their respective expectations of the arrangements, particularly in the light of the position they put forward up to the day of the final hearing.  

 



There is no issue that the threshold criteria are established in this case.  The local authority set out the findings it sought at the outset of the proceedings and a schedule at A6.  Protective measures were instituted at the time the local authority issued proceedings.  Those findings can be summarised as follows:

 

The mother and father's care of AI and her feeding resulted in AI failing to gain weight and having global developmental delay.
 

The mother and father were unable to implement the advice and support of professionals in managing the children's behaviours in relation to food.
 

The involvement of health and other professionals over years did not result in any consistent change.
 

The parents did not accept the concerns about the children's care and development.
 



The local authority set out the further findings it sought in relation to welfare in a schedule dated 9th December 2013 at A102 onwards.  Significant concessions were made by each of the parents in relation to these matters.  I consider that the following findings are properly made out on the evidence before the court:

 

At the time of her removal to foster care AI was chronically undernourished.  Both AI and AR were developmentally delayed in all areas.
 

The children's physical, emotional, psychological and cognitive development was significantly impaired by the parenting afforded them.
 

The children made excellent progress after placement in foster care. AI's failure to thrive and the developmental delay in both girls were attributable to the parenting they received.
 

The parents failed to meet the emotional needs of the children.  The children have attachment difficulties as a result.
 

Although the parents engaged with intensive and extensive professional supports in place for a number of years, they were unable to acknowledge concerns or address them.  The parents continue to have limited understanding and insight into the harm the children have suffered and are still noted to be overly anxious around the children.
 

Intensive support was put in place to assist the parents.  Despite this, the parents remained unable to meet the children's basic needs.
 

There are no further or additional supports which could assist in risk management or bring about a necessary change in the parents.
 

The children, in particular AI, have enhanced needs and require better than good enough parenting.  The parents are unable to offer the necessary standard of parenting, namely consistent, positive, insightful parenting with appropriate levels of stimulation.
 

The parents have great love and affection for the children but sadly they remain unable to recognise or respond to the children's needs, promote their development and offer consistent care and nurturing.
 



I turn to my welfare analysis and the legal framework.  In undertaking my welfare analysis I have had full regard to the recent case law relevant to the approach of the court in determining applications for placement orders.  The judgment of the Supreme Court in Re B (A Child) 2013 UKSC 33 is of central importance in providing guidance as to the correct approach of the court where it is asked to consider a care plan for permanent removal of a child from the birth family.  The judgment given in June 2013 considered in detail the approach to the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 8 proportionality in a public law children case.  The judgments of the Supreme Court Judges stress the significance of a decision of the court to remove a child from his or her birth family, and for the child to be placed for adoption against the wishes of the birth family.

 



The judgments emphasise that a care order and adoption is an extreme outcome and 'a last resort', in the words of Lord Neuberger.  A care order cannot be made in such circumstances unless the order is proportionate, bearing in mind the requirements of Article 8.  Lady Hale described the test for severing the relationship between parent and child as 'very strict: only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short where nothing else will do' - a test of necessity, therefore.  

 



The welfare of the child is paramount but, as Lord Neuberger said at paragraph 77, the interests of a child self evidently require his or her relationship with her natural parents (and I include here the birth family generally) to be maintained unless no other course is possible in the child's interest.  He went on to say (at paragraph 104) that the interests of a child include being brought up by his/her natural family, ideally the natural parents, or at least one of them.       

 



The Court of Appeal gave judgment in Re G (A Child) 2013 EWCA Civ 965 the following month (on 30th July 2013).  The judgment of Lord Justice McFarlane stressed the need for a proper, thorough and holistic evaluation of the placement options, giving full weight to the Article 8 rights.  Such an approach requires the court to balance the pros and cons of the placement options in any case.  He emphasised the need for substantive consideration of the Article 8 considerations in relation to the issues of permanent separation of a child from the birth family.  He said 'what is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options.  

 



Where the court is considering a plan of adoption the evaluation must take place in the context of the welfare provisions of section 1(2) Adoption and Children Act 2002, whereby the child's welfare throughout his or her life is the court's paramount consideration.  The welfare checklist in section 1(4) includes, of course, in section 1(4)(c), the likely effect on the child throughout his life of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person.  

 



Lord Justice McFarlane also referred to Re B and the repeated use in their Lordships judgments as phrases such as 'high degree of justification', 'necessary', 'required', 'a very extreme thing', 'a last resort' and 'nothing else will do'.  He said that, in the light of this 'It is clear that the importance of a child either living with, or maintaining a relationship with, her parents and natural family have not been reduced'.  

 



In Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 the President once again referred to the 'striking' language used by the Supreme Court in Re B as to the degree of necessity before a care plan for adoption is approved.  In paragraph 18, by reference to Strasbourg Authority, he said that the family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances; that everything must be done to preserve personal relationships and 'rebuild' the family; that it is not enough to show a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing.  The President approved the global and holistic approach to the welfare evaluation.  He stressed the need for proper evidence from the local authority and children's guardian, addressing all the realistic options within analysis of the arguments for and against each option.  An adequately reasoned judgment is essential focusing on the factors in play in the particular case.  

 



In Re W (A Child) 2013 EWCA Civ 1227 Lord Justice Ryder emphasised the need for the court to consider the resources and supports that may be available to support a family placement.  The court may require the local authority to provide evidence of such resources.

 



At paragraph 100 he said that the court is to undertake it's evaluation to determine what is best for the child by reference to three questions:

 

What is the welfare analysis of each of the placement options available?
 

What is the welfare evaluation, that is the best option among those available? and
 

What orders are proportionate and necessary, if any?
 



Against this background, I turn to the placement options.  The family proposal is for placement of the girls with the Ys with their mother in the household, effecting a de facto separation between the parents, although they would continue their relationship.  The local authority plan is one of permanent placement of the girls together away from the birth family.  The local authority proposes placement for adoption.  Initial enquiries indicate three possible matches from nationwide enquiries, though only initial indications but without the legal security of placement orders (which often provide more legal security to stimulate a greater interest).  The local authority is optimistic that an appropriate and suitable match would be identified for the children without significant delay.  The local authority proposes a search for a prospective adoptive placement for the girls together for a period of nine months.

 



The local authority's care plan was revised during the course of the social work evidence.  The local authority is not contemplating separation of the children now.  In the event that no adoptive placement is identified within that time, the local authority would look to long term foster care.  The current foster carers have very recently expressed some interest in caring for the children long term, but would not themselves consider adoption.  

 



The welfare of AI and AR throughout their lives is my paramount consideration, in circumstances in which the court is to consider plans including placement for adoption.  They are young girls of Pakistani Muslim heritage who lived with their parents until July 2013.  They have a large extended family in the UK and Pakistan.  The children are too young to express their wishes and feelings very clearly, particularly taking account of the developmental delay.  Nonetheless they clearly have warm relationships with their parents, although they have what is described as insecure attachments.  The children were distressed when they were accommodated but settled without undue difficulty.  The girls have maintained their relationship with their parents through contact four times each week.

 



Both girls have suffered significant harm in the care of their parents, not due to any lack of love or desire to care on the part of the parents, but as a result of their own difficulties and the limitations to their parenting capacity as a result.  As a result of their experiences in the care of their parents, both children need a particularly high standard of consistent parenting throughout their childhood if they are to achieve their potential and avoid a regression from the positive progress they have made in foster care.  They are particularly vulnerable as a result, and at risk of suffering further physical, emotional and psychological harm.  

 



AI and AR have established relationships with their parents, which are described in warm terms.  There is an obvious potential benefit in these relationships continuing, but also the risk of harm of a repetition of the circumstances when the children were in the care of their parents, when their care needs were not met to a significant degree.  

 



The crucial question is the ability and willingness of the family to care for these girls, and whether such a placement can meet their needs.  In assessing this, it is necessary to consider the children's needs and what the family placement is offering.  The findings I have approved confirm the harm these girls experienced and its impact on their future care needs.  

 



I accept the evidence of Dr Ward about the care AI and AR need to address the effects of the care they received before their accommodation.  I am satisfied and find that they both need a high standard of consistent care by carers who accept and understand the impact of their parenting to date and are able to provide responsive care with insight into the girls' needs over time.  

 



The Ys are capable parents who can meet the physical care needs of these children.  The Ys are now saying they will care for AI and AR for as long as necessary.  That is a very recent development.  I was left unconvinced that this is a realistic proposal in circumstances in which I concluded that they simply do not foresee the need for such a long term option, and against the background of the views which they expressed consistently about the children's future placement with their mother until 17th February 2014 and about which MY also spoke in the course of his evidence.

 



The Ys will only contemplate the placement if the mother is part of their household.  Mr Gray said in submissions that he had considered asking the court to give a further opportunity for reflection if I concluded that she could not be in the same household, but he was clear from his conversations with the Ys during the course of the week of the hearing, as well as from the evidence that MY gave, that their position in relation to this is final.

 



A placement with the Ys would provide the very significant benefit for these girls of a placement within their birth family, with experienced parents and grandparents.  It would preserve their relationship with their parents and would allow them to have extensive contact with their mother, who would be living in the same household.  

 



The evidence of the family about the arrangements within the household was unclear and at time contradictory about the role that the mother would have.  The proposal that she is kept away from all childcare responsibilities is, in my judgment, unrealistic, not least because I concluded that neither she nor the family really consider it necessary.

 



The risk of the mother's continuing involvement is the potential impact on the children of her anxious and sadly inadequate parenting to date, and the very serious consequences it had for the children when in the care of their parents.  I have to consider the extent to which that would be ameliorated by the modelling of parenting by the Ys, and the dilution of her influence by their presence.  

 



If the children are not living with the birth family, there are two options which realistically are for consideration.  The local authority's and the children's guardian's preferred option is adoption.  The obviously disadvantage is the termination of legal and actual relationships with the birth family, which is also culturally unacceptable for the birth family.  There is a risk of delay in identifying a placement and a risk of placement breakdown.  The placement of these children will not be without its complexities.  In addition to their care needs, there is a question of the extent to which the religious and cultural heritage can be matched.  I note the local authority's optimism about a placement with Pakistani Muslim family if adoption is approved.

 



The advantage of an adoptive placement is that the girls would be placed with carers who would be assessed and matched to meet the needs of these two girls.  I accept the local authority's evidence that the assessment of any match would be considered with great care.  Adoption, if successful, would provide a secure family placement for the girls throughout their childhood and beyond.  

 



The third option is long term foster care.  There are advantages to long term foster care, if the children are not living with the birth family.  It can allow the children to maintain some contact with the birth family.  It is also more acceptable to the birth family, including in cultural terms.  There is some prospect that the children may be able to stay with the same foster carers.  The disadvantage of a placement in long term foster care relate to the children's continuing status as 'Looked After' children and also the uncertainties which are inherent in long term foster care.  There is no guarantee that their current carers would continue to care for them.

 



Having weighed these options in the balance against the legal framework as I have set it out, and considering a plan of adoption as the option of last resort, I have reached the following conclusions.  In the light of the harm the children have suffered, their parenting needs for the future require them to be protected from the adverse impact of the parenting they experienced from their mother and father.  There is, in my judgment, a high probability that the mother's presence in the Ys' household would have a significant and adverse impact on the children's future, development and well being.

 



I do not consider that her role can realistically be curtailed in circumstances in which she doesn't want or see a need for it.  I do not consider that the Ys understand or accept the need for it.  In practical terms it is not, in my judgment, achievable living in one household with children of this age.  The risk of harm is of exposure to the anxious parenting which led to the children's physical, emotional and psychological needs being significantly compromised.  The effects of their past parenting are such that the children's care needs are greater than would otherwise be the case.  Whether or not the Ys accept this - which I doubt - these care needs cannot, in my judgment, be met in the environment they propose.  

 



I have taken full account of the impact on these girls of a placement away from the birth family, whether by terminating their relationships through adoption or by the limitation in those relationships through long term foster care.  I have also balanced the opposition of the birth family to placement for adoption against the children's need for security and permanence.  I have concluded that the evidence of the local authority that adoption is achievable and realistic should be accepted.  Having regard to the children's experiences to date and their future care needs, I have sadly concluded that security and permanence of an adoptive placement is the only realistic option.  I have, I regret, concluded that nothing else will do.  It is, in my judgment, both necessary and a proportionate response to the issues in the case.

 



I will, therefore, make a care order in respect of both AI and AR, approving the care plan of adoption, subject to an amendment of that care plan to reflect the revision of the local authority's planning set out during the course of the social work evidence in relation to the children's continuing placement together.  

 



I propose then to deal with the placement application immediately.   I have just made care orders in respect of these two young girls, AI and AR, approving the local authority's care plan of adoption.  The judgment I have given sets out the basis upon which I have concluded that adoption is sadly the only realistic alternative for AI and AR, applying the section one welfare test in accordance with the 2002 Adoption and Children Act.  The local authority invites the court to consider the placement applications and make placement orders to allow it to progress its planning for the children.  

 



The local authority has filed placement applications, supported by a statement of facts and an Annex B report in each case.  The children's guardian has filed a report supporting the applications for placement orders.  

 



In the course of the judgment that I have given, I have addressed the areas of the welfare checklist in section 1(4) Adoption and Children Act 2002, which I consider to be particularly material.  I have set out in that judgment what I consider to be the relevant factors balancing the children's welfare needs.  

 



The parents of these children do not consent to the applications for placement orders.  Quite understandably, they oppose the plan of adoption and they do not give their consent to the applications.   In such circumstances I can only make placement orders if I dispense with their consent in accordance with section 52 of the 2002 Act on the basis that the children's welfare requires it.  Article 8 rights are clearly engaged - there can be no greater interference with Article 8 rights than orders relating to adoption.  For the reasons that I have set out in the judgment that I have given in the care applications, I have concluded that the plan of adoption is the only plan which will meet the welfare interests of these children throughout their lives.  I have made care orders approving the care plan of adoption in each case. 

 



Having regard to the circumstances of these children there is, in my judgment, a need for the plans to be progressed without any delay and to maximise the pool of those who may put themselves forward as prospective adopters.  The welfare of the children throughout their lives is my paramount consideration.  I consider that the making of placement orders is the only order which will meet the welfare needs of the children in allowing the local authority to progress the plan of adoption.

 



I have taken account of the plan for contact, which is for the children to maintain contact with their birth family through indirect contact only.  I have considered the circumstances in which the parents find themselves unable to consent to the plan for adoption in circumstances in which I have reached the conclusion that the plan of adoption is the only placement option which can meet these children's needs throughout their lives.  I have reached the conclusion that the consent of the parents to the placement applications must be dispensed with on the basis that the welfare of each of the children requires it.  

 



I therefore make a placement order in respect of each of the children, dispensing with parental consent.  In respect of each of the applications I make a direction for public funding assessment as required.

 



End of Judgment

We hereby certify that this judgment has been approved by Her Honour Judge Hudson.

I am concerned with CM born on [on a date in] 2006 � he is therefore 7 years and 10 months old and is the subject of these care proceedings. He is represented through his Children's Guardian Mr S. by Miss Taylor. 

 



His parents are Mrs LM,("The Mother") and Mr KM,("The Father"), represented by Miss Wilson and Mr Stevenson-Watt respectively.

 



The Local Authority, West Sussex County Council, represented by Miss Golden, apply for a care order in respect of CM with a care plan which is for long-term foster care with a care plan for contact between CM and his parents and extended family to which I shall return in due course. The parents oppose the application.

 





THE BACKGROUND





LM and KM are married and both have parental responsibility for CM. In June 2013, there was a joint visit by police and social services which saw the initiation of proceedings. 

 



There has been involvement with Children's Services since 2008. Against a background of  increasingly serious concerns for CM's welfare, including the concern that CM was being inappropriately medicated by his parents, and a very real and obvious deterioration in CM's presentation, where he was seen sobbing at school on an almost daily basis, a police raid took place on the family home and a number of pills were discovered thought to be Ritalin and Melatonin � some with American labels. A serious situation developed at the family home when the mother was out of control and the father rushed to school to get CM. When he arrived, he fell and broke his leg, requiring surgery. The concerns were such that a police protection order was sought. 

 



An interim care order was made on the 12th June 2013. 

 



CM was medically assessed. After he was removed from the care of his parents he was placed with foster carers who have experience of children with additional needs. Contact currently takes place with his parents once a week, supervised, for 1� hours. It was previously twice a week, but was reduced because of worries about his behaviour before and after contact. He also sees his paternal grandmother once a week, supervised, and has had contact to his paternal grandfather and his wife. Sadly CM's current foster carers, J and G,  with whom he has thrived have felt unable to offer him long-term care. Were I to make a care order they are willing to continue to look after CM until a long-term placement is found. 

 



The case has not been capable of conclusion on the 26 week track due to the late filing of evidence and the non-availability of an expert witness. CM's maternal aunt and uncle had been positively assessed as Special Guardians for CM but sadly they withdrew on the 22nd October 2013, which also prejudiced an early conclusion for CM. 

 





That is the short background to the proceedings. The deeper history relating to CM is set out at great length in the papers. There is long record of involvement with the family both with the Local Authority and with the health service and the chronologies should be read alongside this judgment. 

 



The medical chronology goes back to CM's birth and runs to many pages.  There is a very extensive social work chronology which I appreciate is not accepted in its entirety by the parents, which I describe as a catalogue of escalating concerns from the time of the initial referral to the Local Authority in September 2008 to date. The evidence is extremely dense and complex, but ultimately the issues and patterns which emerge are very clear.

 



I summarise them as follows: the parents began seeking medical help for CM when he was very young. When he was only 5 months old he was admitted to hospital with diarrhoea and the reason given for his admission was his mother's anxiety. These were the origins of a pattern of behaviour by the parents which is clearly established on the evidence. They sought treatment and referrals time and time again. Time and again CM was referred to specialists. Time and again the referrals were not followed through, and when they were, those who saw CM were presented with a history given by the parents which was, I am satisfied, coloured by their own anxieties and beliefs about the nature of his problems.  The net result was that CM was seen throughout his life by doctors and specialists, and diagnoses were made on the basis of the reports given by the parents, who have proved adept at researching medical conditions on the internet and ascribing a condition to CM, seeking treatment or medication for that condition based on their conviction that he was suffering from some identifiable problem. 

 



At the root of this anguished quest by the parents was CM's behaviour. It was at times extreme, and also violent. At times it still is extreme and violent, and as recently as 10th January 2014, CM attacked his male foster-carer. He went to claw his face, kicked him in the face with the sole of his foot, and tried to bite, punch and kick him. He had to be restrained in a very dramatic fashion. He then went for the foster-carer's head, pulling his hair and ear and saying that he would pull his eyes out and pull his face off. At school in September 2012 he was excluded because he launched such a violent attack on a female member of staff that she suffered a suspected fracture to her arm.  These outbursts of uncontrollable rage and violence are lessening, but these are examples of the uncontrolled forces that overtake this little boy and pose such a huge challenge to those caring for him.  

 



CM's behaviour had been too much for the parents. He had presented them throughout his time in their care with extremes of behaviour and they had reacted as they thought best with what on any analysis were extreme measures at times. To their way of thinking, CM had a medical problem and if that was the case it would explain what was going on.

 



In the summer of 2008 the Health Visitor's notes record that the mother asked for a visit as she was finding it difficult to cope with CM's behaviour, which was aggressive and hitting out, and was reporting that she suffers from ADHD.

 



Mother has regularly been reported as having told others that she is suffering from some form of serious medical problem, or that CM has suffered some extreme medical problem. 

 



I have seen a letter from Dr McEntagart a consultant clinical geneticist, dated 31st December 2013. In that report Dr McEntagart records the mother as having a diagnosis of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. Further she records that the mother is undergoing treatment for Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. 

 



When this was explored with the mother in evidence she explained that she had looked it up on the internet and had told her GP that she thought she had Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy and had sought a referral for that.

 



As regards any treatment, she said that there had been a referral to Dr R, an adult psychiatrist, to look further into this issue, but that had not taken place yet. She is not therefore undergoing any such treatment at present, nor is there any formal diagnosis that I am aware of other than the mother's self diagnosis from her internet research. This encapsulates the problem she presents as an anxious medical historian who bases her researches on the web. 

 





Returning to CM, in 2009, the mother reported her suspicions that he had ADHD. The Health Visitor discounted the possibility of ADHD and the concern that he might have autism in November of that year. In January 2010 the parents sought a second opinion and a diagnosis of autism. CM was referred to a specialist, Dr Jonathan, but the appointments were not kept. In May there was a referral to Children's Services which on any reading was highly concerning: the note reads:

 





Referral to CS. CM seen sitting in M's lap front of car unrestrained. M says she gives in as CM screams in the back. Some time ago CM seen to bite F in crotch, F smacked CM around the head x3; neighbour heard CM screaming "don't hit me"; CM strangled another boy at his birthday party; M had said in Jan 2012 CM was due in hospital for a twisted bowel. Later said she had cured it with Actimel; subsequently M said GP had diagnosed 25% ASD and GP had signed benefit forms, M said CM had ADHD and not ASD; later it wasn't ADHD but insomnia; CM no bedtime routine and appears to rule the house, family always unwell.





The entry and the events preceding the entry conveniently encapsulate the ensuing matters contained in the ever-growing chronology of concerns. The themes by this time are established. The parents seek a diagnosis but do not always follow through referrals. There are frequent medical appointments and a variety of medications are administered. CM continues to behave in violent and challenging ways, both to his parents and towards other children; his father in particular reacts with excessive physical force; both parents employ extreme techniques to seek to control him such as wetting his face and smacking him.  The mother in particular exaggerates or fabricates medical symptoms both about herself and about CM, and both parents regularly give in to him instead of setting appropriate boundaries, the lack of which is a very significant feature. 

 



In addition, some of CM's most fundamental needs were going unmet to his serious detriment. He was clearly in need from an early age of support with his speech and language, but referrals were not taken up � the father told me they were defeated by the paperwork involved, but that is not acceptable as this need went unaddressed for a very long time. 

 



Ultimately the quest for a diagnosis for CM has dominated the medical evidence.  I will later summarise the long route that has lead to the most recent conclusions as to what it is that has been at the root cause of CM's difficulties and what are likely to be his abiding features. What is clear is that the distressing story of CM and his development whilst in the care of his parents is resolving itself into a very different picture since he has been parented in a safe, insightful and consistent way by his very experienced foster-carers and he is changing and making real progress. 

 





THE ISSUES



 The local authority say that as between the available options for CM, namely long-term foster-care with very experienced carers or a return to his parents, the only viable option to meet his highly complex needs is long-term foster care. 

 



The mother and father ask that CM be returned to their care with a supervision order  or even a care order in place if necessary and oppose the care plan as it relates to contact. Both of them say that they have already made changes and have finally understood what is required of them and are willing to do anything to have their son home. They both genuinely believe that they are now able to parent him differently after this terrible experience of the care system, and assert that I can rely on their word and the evidence of the improvements in their abilities to look after CM from what has gone on in contact. They tell me that the home conditions are much improved and I do accept that.  They believe that their plans and good intentions for the care of CM will be carried through and they tell me that they have family support which they believe is sufficient. The mother says in her statement that she has sought counselling to deal with her issues. She says in her statement that she is seeing Dr Rikaby in March to begin hypnotherapy, but she told me in evidence that she had been referred to Dr Rikaby for suspected Munchuasen Syndrome by Proxy and that the hypnotherapy was to help with her telling lies and exaggerating. I remain unclear about what will actually be provided for her. 

 



The Guardian's firm opinion is that CM's needs are best met through long-term foster-care, given the depth of his present and future needs and the need for very able carers who can provide him with the necessary level of consistent and safe parenting. He believes that CM would be at further risk of significant harm if he were to be returned to them. 

 



The Threshold Criteria are now agreed in this case. There has been a long dispute over their contents: in November one of the reasons the IRH was adjourned was because the parents indicated that they were on the point of agreeing the threshold criteria, but it has taken until now for that to happen.  I approve the agreed threshold as representative, on the evidence, of the causes of the extremely significant harm suffered by CM and the legal test that confers jurisdiction on me to pass to the next stage of decision making is met. I have concerns about that document. I observe that the measure of the harm and the depth of the problems in this case are very profound. 

 



In particular, having heard the father's evidence, I remain concerned that he continues to minimise and justify some of the things which he says he has agreed to. For the record, on this particularly lean set of headlines, I have taken into account the father's agreement given upon instructions, but if it is the case that in reality he does not fully agree with what is contained in the document, and does not fully appreciate that these matters are relied upon to establish the fact that on an evidential basis  CM suffered and was at risk of suffering significant harm at the relevant date, nevertheless I am satisfied that on the evidence the threshold criteria are fully made out as drafted to the requisite standard. 

 



For the record, the headlines of that document are as follows: - 

 



a.	(i) CM's parents have at times been confused as to the dosage of prescribed medication to be given to CM, e.g whether the dosage of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) should be 20mg or 15 mg

(ii) The parents have increased the dosage of Melatonin ( herbal) given to CM from 2 mg to 4 mg without proper medical approval. 

b.	CM has displayed extreme behavioural difficulties which following the

parents' description to professionals has led to misdiagnosis of ASD and ADHD

c.	The parents have missed some medical appointments for CM

d.	The parents have, on occasions, used inappropriate methods of physical and verbal chastisement which, because of a lack of understanding at the time of CM's difficulties and complex needs, may have exacerbated his behavioural and attachment difficulties. 

e.	The physical state and cleanliness of the family home has been noted to be of an unacceptable and unhygienic nature at times

f.	CM has witnessed incidents of domestic abuse between his parents

g.	CM's parents have both endured adverse childhood experiences which have rendered them unable adequately to consistently meet CM's complex emotional and behavioural needs.



I must therefore decide which placement out of the available options best meets CM's welfare, and if the option is for a return to his parents whether a Supervision Order is required and if not what the level of contact for CM should be. 

 



THE EVIDENCE



The Social Worker for CM who has reported in the case and prepared the final care plan, Mr P-W, is on long-term sick leave. Instead the Team Manager Ms B has given evidence in support of the Local Authority's case. 

 



I have read the papers. I have an addendum care plan provided by the Local Authority which has modified the original care plan. I have heard the oral evidence of Sylvia Duncan, consultant child psychologist, of Miss B the team manager, Miss HB the senior Social Worker who prepared a comprehensive parenting assessment, the mother, the father and the Guardian Mr S. 

 



There is a great deal of written evidence which has not been challenged. I have read the papers and the extensive contact and foster care notes, and the lengthy medical records which appear in the bundle. 

 



Because of the length of the records I do not intend to give more than a starred summary of the trajectory of CM's medical history beyond what I have already touched upon. 

 



Genetic testing revealed that he has a deletion on chromosome 16, a feature shared with his mother. This may have implications for his development in terms of cognitive difficulties and other potential long-term difficulties. It is not however associated with behavioural difficulties although I note that the parents may have sought to make a link with this feature and CM's behaviour. 

 



In brief, moving through a very concerning volume of referrals and missed appointments, of visits to specialists and varying diagnoses, the medical issues relating to CM have now begun to come towards full circle. I can begin with the report of Dr Perera of 7th March 2013. On that occasion he provides a diagnosis on Axis II of Autistic Spectrum Disorder with disorganised/disorientated attachment style, ADHD, Specific Reading Difficulty, Moderate or mild leaning difficulty, on Axis III chromosome deletion syndrome, on Axis IV "only child of parents living in impoverished circumstances who have genuinely struggled to met his complex needs without outside help until the safeguarding referral had been made.

 



He goes on to say "I did consider a diagnosis of conduct disorder but I have noticed significant improvement in his behaviour since he had been at the BC, where his developmental needs have been more clearly identified. I also considered a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder but there is no clear evidence of severe parental neglect though they will have to improve their skills parenting with professional help given that there is now much better understanding of their son's complex needs"

 



Dr Atkinson, Consultant Community Paediatrician undertook a developmental assessment after CM had been placed with foster-carers for 8 weeks, and reported in 8th August 2013 that CM was functioning about a year behind his chronological age but she thought that this conclusion might be related to his early experiences of life and emotional trauma. She reported that he was a child "craving love and affection and who requires boundaries, praise and encouragement".

 





Dr Perera later reported on 25th June 2012. He reviewed his previous diagnosis in the light of further information about the parents and the unreliability of their accounts, and wrote as follows:

 



"It is most likely that the effects of poor parenting upon CM has been subject to emotional abuse, physical abuse and neglect by his parents, who have not adequately engaged with social services in the previous year in order to improve their parenting skills. Furthermore they have repeatedly sought diagnostic assessment from Dr Sue Shah at the Child Development Clinic, Dr Mohammed Twaij Community Paediatrician at the Child Development Centre, and myself......A diagnosis of ADHD cannot be made safely because it relied on a lot of the history given by KM and LM. As a consequence of the child rearing he has experienced..... CM has developed a disorganised attachment style....A diagnosis of Autistic Spectrum Disorder cannot be made at this time."



Dr Perera was prepared to review his opinion in relation to ASD at a later date and also advised that CM should not be given medication.

 



The parents have not challenged this very comprehensive report and I have no reason to go against his thorough review and analysis of CM's difficulties and their origins. 

 



I heard from Ms B the team manager, She is at some disadvantage as she has not been as directly involve in the case as Ms JB and Mr P-W. However I was satisfied that she was sufficiently familiar with the case to give evidence in their stead. 

 



The Social Workers' reports are very full indeed. Mr P-W has provided a very clear and focussed analysis of the evidence. He was not able to speak to his reports but Ms B is clearly familiar with the case. She has updated me as regards the current situation in terms of finding a placement for CM. As well an in-house search the Local Authority has 37 providers and five potential placements have been identified. That is encouraging. 

 



CM was excluded from his primary school in September 2012 because he attacked and injured a teacher. His current placement at the B is short term. As regards his schooling it is recognised that there may be a gap. One appropriate school locally will not have a place for him until September. His proposed statement of special educational needs is very detailed. It will be of real assistance and will be a key analysis in terms of finding the right school to match his extensive difficulties. There are a number of potentially suitable schools in the area but if he were placed out of area it would assist him in receiving the right level of education services. However there may well be a gap, possibly until the start of the next school year in September before he goes to a new school, and I must trust that he receives the appropriate level of specialised schooling before then so that the structure from school he requires is not removed.

 



I heard from the Guardian who has prepared two analyses and who is clear in his recommendations that CM's needs should be met in an appropriate and skilled foster placement long term. His opinion is that CM would suffer further harm if returned to his parents' care and he has not been deflected from that view having heard all the evidence.

 



I find that his evidence was fair to the parents but wholly focussed on CM's needs. As regards contact he told me that in future it would have to be seen from CM's shoes and he felt that quarterly contact was right for at least 2 years, but if it was wrong for CM it should reduce. His concern was for CM to be able to settle without any harmful disruption. He was heartened by the progress in finding a placement for CM and that costs were not seen as a problem because in his view it is vital that CM reaches his potential. He felt CM was able to cope with change as long as it was spelt clearly out to him and he was given a clear narrative. He also saw the role of the IRO as very crucial in this case. 

 



Sylvia Duncan is a Chartered Clinical Psychologist whose experience in the field of assessments of children and families and is very extensive. She has pulled together the complex threads in this case, many of which have required professional "untangling". 

 



If ever an expert was "necessary", this is a case where that criteria could never be questioned, given the difficulties. Miss Duncan reported on 24th September 2013 and her addendum report is dated 25th October 2013. Her evidence is very extensive, and the overview she provides is based on an extremely thorough approach to her investigations � she spoke at length to the people who know CM best; his parents, his school, the social work team, the geneticist and the Guardian, and met of course with CM himself. 

 



She does not believe that CM can in any circumstances be returned to the care of his parents and in this case her expertise and her evidence is pivotal. 

 



Having heard her cross-examined at length on behalf of the parents, when nothing that they could advance and challenge made any impact upon her well-reasoned views, I am clear about the reasons why she takes the view that they cannot meet his needs.

 



She puts side by side in her report the categories of concerns and behaviours. These can be illustrated briefly as follows: 

 



a.	The issues concerning CM's "medicalised" life and the parents' anxieties and beliefs about his difficulties which were clearly discordant, disproportionate and generated by deep anxiety, leading in turn to CM being affected by that anxiety

b.	The issues as regards his behaviours and troubled reactions at school which clearly show the extreme feelings and difficulties besetting him in that context, often resulting in aggressive and very violent behaviour

c.	The dramatic changes noted in him by the school and others after he was placed with his foster-carers which is very strongly evidenced, as is the anxiety generated as he anticipated contact. In addition, there is clear evidence of his positive response to clear boundaries, structure, certainty and routine. 

d.	His communication difficulties, his difficulties with his peers, his issues surrounding food and eating and his difficulties coping with change. 



Sylvia Duncan has reviewed the available medical evidence and the conclusions of the geneticist in order to provide a picture of the developmental issues which CM is facing: the chromosome deletion is associated with cognitive impairment, developmental delay, impaired communication and social and language skills and possibly dysmorphism.  The outcome for CM is difficult to gauge and will ultimately depend of the level of severity. It is relevant that it is not a condition with associated behavioural problems.

 



As regards the issue of autism, she notes the discrepancies between the parents' reports of CM's behaviour, and external reports.  Ultimately she reports that CM does display some autistic features, but the 	question is whether he suffers from autism or quasi-autistic features resulting from attachment difficulties. In her view the areas of significant recent improvement suggests that his problems are influenced by environmental factors � indeed she is optimistic that there is scope for improvement if, crucially, CM gets the right level of education in the future. I have seen his draft Statement of Educational Needs which means that CM will need a high level of support to achieve his potential.

 



Miss Duncan reports that CM wants to go home to his parents but that he is ambivalent about this because he has clearly also said that his mother scares him. He has expressed his wish to go home to his Guardian as well and this comes as no surprise. Indeed in contact although concerns about what has been happening in that context have been brought to my attention, the parents are generally warm and loving and clearly doing their very best to make the experience as positive as possible for him.  Sylvia Duncan recognises the loving aspects of the relationship she has observed.

 



She suggests that CM's difficulties have been impacted upon by his parenting and environment because things have improved  so much since he was removed from his parents' care. She sees that there is probably scope for further improvement as a result.  His unpredictable parenting was more or less the antithesis of what he needed and that the parents' preoccupation with their own needs and interests made them unavailable to CM a lot of the time. She described the parents and CM as more or less living separate existences when they or he would withdraw from each other. Because of his attachment difficulties he needs to live in a place where anxieties are reduced as much as possible

 



The portrait of CM which emerges very clearly from this report and all the evidence is of a little boy who is now cheerful with a sunny personality, who is engaging and endearing. HB describes his needs as complex and enduring. He still shows signs of insecurity, and continues to have outbursts, though this is improving. It is clear that he is and is likely to continue to  be a complex child with identifiable behaviour and developmental difficulties. Sylvia Duncan is crystal clear that CM requires reliable and predictable care in order to develop a sense of security, and in her view his early care has been the antithesis of what was needed for him � indeed his phenotype means that he is more sensitive than other children to a lack of calm and a contained emotional environment. 

 



She told me in evidence that the parents have made some small changes, however there has been no fundamental change in their capacity to meet CM's huge needs.

 



The intensive observations of this expert and her clear conclusions have provided me with what I consider to be a reliable, focussed and insightful view. I find she has balanced her opinion and weighed up the positives against the negatives, and I have set it against the other evidence with which it chimes consistently.

 



I rely upon her evidence and that of the Guardian for the best part of my understanding of CM as he is now, and his needs. Of course his parents know him and brought him up,  but Sylvia Duncan is of the view that neither of them has really grasped the complexity of his needs, nor that they are equipped to react to them given their own very specific needs. 

 



I note that she was concerned about the thin threshold document, and she said that she felt that that document did not cover the breadth and depth of the case, leaving the seriousness of the issues unconfirmed. I acknowledge that comment, because the case is hugely complex, but the threshold can be seen as a jurisdictional tool. I fully accept the gravity of the concerns evidenced in the case, with which the lean threshold document conforms.

 





Turning from the portrait of CM which I now have, I turn to the evidence in relation to his parents to complete the central family triangle.

 





To piece together an understanding of the parents I have heard from both of them, I have read the statements they have obtained from extended family, I have read the reports emanating from CM's school about them,  I have read the reports of the social workers, and heard from the team manager Ms B. I also heard from Miss HB a senior social worker who undertook a parenting assessment tailored with elements of the PAMS model. The parents did not find her easy to work with and Mr Stevenson-Watt puts it that they experienced her as supercilious towards them, however to their credit they did complete this work.

 



I have seen that the parents feel that they did not get the right kind of support. In fact I do not accept their view of that. What I do believe is that they have found it incredibly challenging  to engage with social services because they have felt very anxious, defensive and have to a fairly high degree resented the interventions they have had in their lives rather than seeing them as positive. They have, I find, not wholly seen the need for the type of parenting  work  provided by the Family Intervention Team although they have clearly wanted help.  It is clear that their first port of call for answers and cures has been the medical profession.  There were clearly significant barriers and the Family Intervention Team work which was planned to help them was not taken up to any real extent by the father (who clearly had issues with the work, whatever his explanation for not attending and completing the course). The mother did engage but did not go to all the sessions required and in my view where advice and support has tended to reveal her deficiencies and require a shift in her thinking and behaviour she has found it at times overwhelmingly difficult to accept.

 



Miss HB undertook a comprehensive parenting assessment of the parents, and has prepared an addendum exploring the issue of future contact. She took photographs of the family home which I have seen and which clearly indicate that at that time things were on top of the parents in terms of their ability to keep the house safe.  There is a very pretty garden, however. I do not intend to repeat much of it here. They have challenged her report and its contents, which explores many aspects of the parents' thinking and reactions to the situation and is a fundamental piece of evidence in the case which the parents do not accept. When I read the assessment I see that despite that view they were to their credit able to participate in the work much of which would have been very painful for them, and they managed to spend a great deal of time with her for the purpose of the work. 

 





I find her report to be sophisticated, and I understand how the parents might feel that it goes over their heads or that they have been misrepresented. However I do not agree with them. The information is in my view very comprehensive and it was done in a way which made every allowance for any limitations of understanding they might have. Its conclusions are of course very difficult for them to hear where they are negative and these are parents who have for a long time been defensive when challenged by professionals and who are not in any way sophisticated themselves. 

 



She has identified and reported upon the significant components of CM's make up, and those of his parents, including an overview of the real difficulties which they both experienced in their earlier lives. The mother was able to open up to her to the extent that she acknowledged that some of the things she had reported to others had not been true, for example she had told JB that she had been in care, but was now able to say that that was not true. Hers is a very sad story. 

 





I consider this evidence to be key in relation to the outcome and should be read in its entirety by anyone considering this judgment in future.  Much of what it reveals was noticeable in the evidence of the parents themselves, in particular their "limited acceptance and recognition of the harm caused to CM".   

 



Her views about contact were that there had been some improvement, but a "lack of embedded learning, praise, picking up on cues and a lack of real understanding of what was going on for CM". In her view they had a very poor understanding of his emotional needs. She had concerns about some things which happen in contact for example that the father has told CM to tell the Social Workers that he wants to come home, and has told him to pull his socks up or he won't come home. Father does not agree that he has said all of the things referred to, but I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to find that he has not been attuned to CM's emotional needs at all times during contact and has said inappropriate things to CM, and not grasped the implications of what he has said for CM.

 



She makes similar observations to Sylvia Duncan. She describes CM as a highly aroused, anxious boy, and the parents as anxious and unable to put themselves in his shoes, because they are so wrapped up in their own issues. She too predicts serious harm if he is to return home. She described the parents as egocentric, and reports that they clearly believe that CM's problems are not their fault. 

 



The challenge to HB's evidence has not been successful. She was thoughtful and fair in my judgment and her conclusions are based on research and experience.  

 





THE PARENTS



The parents are now, at the door of the court, and perhaps for the first time, prepared to concede that they "have both endured adverse childhood experiences which have rendered them unable adequately to consistently meet CM's complex emotional and behavioural needs". 

 



It is however their case that they have now made the changes required of them. 

 





THE FATHER



I will begin with Mr M. He provided me with a lovely photograph of CM, and there is no doubt that he cares deeply and desperately for his only child. He told me with pride how he and CM enjoyed their time at home together when they constructed a fabulous model railway and enjoyed gardening together and  playing on the computer. He is proud of CM's gardening skills which he passed on to him. 

 



Mr M has a raft of diagnosed health difficulties and his mobility is limited. There is no need to rehearse the nature of those difficulties here save to say that they obviously prevent him from being an active parent to a young and explosively energetic child. Sylvia Duncan describes him as "an absent father" during contact, meaning that he was not engaged and not active. He is dyslexic. Dr Gary Taylor undertook a cognitive assessment of him which indicated that due to memory difficulties it is more difficult for him to process complex information or perform more complicated reasoning tasks. 

 



He does not feel that they got the appropriate level or type of help with CM's needs from the Local Authority. He told me he would accept any help from them now "to keep them (i.e. Social Services) happy".

 



His parenting style and approach to discipline has been very negative. He knows this and thinks however that he has changed and now understands that this was not good for CM. He has been very slow indeed to understand how his punitive handling of CM may have affected him and also slow to understand that he should not always give in to CM's demands. He told me that CM is "allergic to the word no". Yet at the same time he says that he knows he needs boundaries. In contact he has given into CM's demands. HB found that he did not demonstrate a good enough understanding or ability to pick upon CM's cues and join in the sessions as fully as he could have.

 



I find that in his evidence he had a tendency to see CM as the cause of the problem. He told me "If I said he had done wrong, he would cause an argument". He also found it difficult to agree that his chastisement of CM had been inappropriate, although he did accept that for the purpose of the threshold.  His concession is limited but I am satisfied on all the evidence that they way Mr M dealt with CM was not appropriate parenting for this child, with his needs, and it must have been frightening for CM to have been handled by both his parents in what I find was a punitive fashion.

 



Mr M has my sympathy because he clearly has many unmet needs of his own. He suffered a very serious injury and was close to tears as he told me about it. He said he would like counselling for this. I had no sense that he was able to understand the need for real and lasting intervention to deal with his underlying difficulties. I am also clear that he is still not able to identify CM's needs and the reasons for the work which was offered to the family. I believe he has experienced it as very intrusive and difficult. He loves CM profoundly. 

 



THE MOTHER



Mrs M in evidence was prepared to make concessions as regards her own difficulties. She too is of course desperate to regain the care of her son. She clearly believes that she has made the necessary and appropriate changes which will enable her to parent CM adequately now. She loves CM profoundly. 

 



I have seen the medical evidence filed in the case about her. She has a history of depression but according to her GP she did not use the medication in a beneficial way, choosing instead to take her prescribed medication in short bursts rather than for the longer recommended periods. She was referred to counselling in October 2010 but did not take up the referral. He states that she did not have formal diagnosis of ADHD but had been referred for further investigations by Dr Perera. 

 



She was referred to Dr Jain for her own suspected ADHD but he did not make that diagnosis and has discharged her from his clinic.  She said in a statement that she was due to start "counselling on 10th January through Dr Rikaby" but I am unclear about what she thought that was for or what the nature of it was. She has not to my knowledge yet had counselling. 

 





She has had one session of hypnotherapy and says that a further referral to hypnotherapy is going to happen to help her deal with her lying and exaggerating.  I have already described her evidence in relation to her self-diagnosis of Munchausen by Proxy. It is clear to me that Mrs M is able to say what she thinks I want to hear, but the truth and accuracy of her evidence is hard to evaluate. Her understanding of the gravity of the situation however was in my judgment still at its very beginning. 

 



She told me that she was in a better place now, and was much stronger and more able to meet CM's needs.  She was able to tell me what changes she had made and wants me to accept that she has now understood what is needed for CM - a calm approach. She was able to tell me what she would do for example if he had a violent outburst, but I am sorry to say that her evidence did not convince me that she has made any of the real and vital changes to the deeply damaged aspects of her personality. She is absolutely genuine in her belief that she is now able to parent CM, but I find that there is a gulf of understanding between what she believes she can do and the reality of what CM actually needs.

 



That highlights the dilemma in this case: there is an abundance of love for CM, but a dearth of parenting ability and understanding of his needs.

 





She has found the intervention of the local authority unwelcome and intrusive. By way of example at a meeting on 20th March 2013, which I accept was very emotive for the parents, she described her reaction as follows in the email she sent complaining about their treatment: "Once home I had enough of being told what I could and could not do � I took a diazepam to calm myself but it made me spaced out". On another occasion she was told by the social worker that an appointment had been made for her to see Dr Perera at 5.15 in the evening. Her reaction was that that was not fair as it was her tea time". I appreciate that at that time things for the family were coming very much to a head and I am sure they found the whole experience overwhelming, but my impression is that until very recently, perhaps until just before this hearing, the parents have been reluctant to accept that intervention was necessary.

 



Mrs M denies that many of the professional recordings put to her are accurate and truthful. Some of them she said she believed had been made up by the Social Worker. 

 



She denied purchasing Ritalin for CM on the internet - ( Mr M told me that it was not possible to do so, but I am not convinced of that). However the police did not take the matter any further as regards the medication found at the family home and in my judgment it is not safe to make a finding about this. 

 



I felt that like Mr M she did think that CM's behaviour was somehow his fault. For example she told me about an incident where CM had tried to strangle Mr M when he was driving. It was hard to escape the conclusion that she blamed CM for what was happening and was not able to be objective about his behaviour. 

 



Mrs M was very controlled as she gave her evidence, to her credit, given the emotions engaged here. She flatly denied ever seeing her husband ever hit or scream at CM, or kick or restrain him. There is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. She denied hitting him herself, but accepted that she smacked him. She also denied flicking water onto him she said she used a cold flannel on him because he gets a temperature when he has an outburst. However she has also said that the social workers advised them to flick water on him. I found Mrs M to be an unreliable witness � she recognises her own issue with the truth.

 





I express my sympathy for the parents who face an enormous uphill struggle to change their basic personalities. Neither of them has undertaken any significant intervention to address these long-standing difficulties.  I know how hard they have tried to improve their home, and how hard they have tried to make contact a good experience for CM and all of that is to their credit. 

 



THE LAW



The local authority must prove its case. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. I am satisfied that the threshold criteria are met, and my remaining task is to examine how CM's welfare which is paramount will be best met in future. I must apply my mind to the requirements of the welfare checklist pursuant to S 1 (3) CA 1989. I must consider what orders are needed and have regards to the need for proportionality and to the rights which are engaged here to family life. 

 



No-one has sought to address me at all on the law, but I have of course reminded myself of recent authority, and of the need to take an holistic view of CM's welfare, based on all the evidence, and to weigh carefully and systematically the competing options available for him.

 



SUBMISSIONS



Counsel for both parents have done their utmost for their clients and their submissions have been measured. Mr Stevenson-Watt relies upon CM's stated wishes, perhaps overlooking the fact that they are clearly evidenced as ambiguous.  He advances the case that there would be a great deal of family support, and that despite the grandparents'' age they are fully committed to offering as much support as needed. He has advanced an inventory of support to bolster CM's placement at home, and is clear that should that be the outcome his client will engage and will seek treatment for himself. Miss Wilson echoes his submissions and advances the changes the mother has made and the fact that she now says she knows that there is no medical cause for CM's behavioural problems, as if that were the breakthrough. She advances the risk of placement breakdown.

 



In reply Ms Golden reminds me that Sylvia Duncan believes that the risk of breakdown if CM was placed at home would be greater than if he were placed in foster-care. Miss Taylor reminds me of the essence of the Guardian's concerns that the parents have not made the changes necessary to meet CM's needs. 

 

 



THE OPTIONS



CM's needs are very great. His parents have a variety of difficulties and unmet needs themselves. It is his right to be cared for by his family if that is at all possible. I must therefore weigh what are the only two options in the balance � the pros and cons of each have been explored in evidence and I have ample information before me. 

 



In my consideration of the options I have of course borne in mind that CM's welfare is paramount and of course had regards to S1(3) CA 1989 which I have woven in to my analysis below, with a baseline of  CM's very particular characteristics and needs. 

 



Mr P-W the Social Worker has provided an analysis exploring to some extent the all-options check-list for CM, including adoption as possible outcome, one however which no-one wisely pursues here given his age and the unlikelihood of a placement being available for him. 

 



There is no written information as regards the possible outcome of a placement at home in terms of what provision might be offered but this has been fully explored in evidence.

 



Turning first to the option of long-term foster care, with the supports outlined in the amended care plan, the benefits to CM would be as follows:

 



a.	I am assured that the search for the right family where he would be the youngest child by a long way or placed on his own is not limited by resources. It is acknowledged that at present there are a number of children with similar needs to CM for whom the LA are seeking a specialised placement, and it may be that the search would need to be widened, though I agree that a placement in this area would be to his great advantage. The Social Worker Miss B is confident based on her knowledge of the case that it will be possible to find a suitable foster-family for CM by April. 



b.	CM has thrived and changed in a very significant way since he has lived away from his parents. He is well-cared for and has settled extremely well into an experienced home where he is given consistent parenting and proper boundaries. He appears to be able to adapt well to changes when he is given clear explanations about what is going to happen. He adapted very well to life with his current carers and that is a good pointer. It is likely that he would adapt to new carers.



c.	CM will need a home where his needs are given the highest priority over and above those of his carers, something which he has now enjoyed. He will need attuned and sensitive parenting by people who can offer him consistent support in all areas: his schooling, his social life, interventions with regards to his developmental and any medical needs, and who can accept and implement professional advice when it is needed. It is likely that he will have more chance of achieving his potential according the Guardian if that kind of care is available to him.



d.	His proposed statement of Special Educational Needs will be a useful tool and would give his carers a clear picture of how his educational needs will need to met in future. He would need adults who can work closely with his school and import an enhanced understanding of CM into that arena to help him realise his potential. 



e.	There would be a need for an appropriate level of support from Children's Services tailored to CM's needs and to supporting his carers, and that support would enhance his progress. CM would have the benefit of work to help him make sense of his history and circumstances in the form of life story work which hopefully would give him a clear and understandable idea of his place in the world.



f.	He would be likely to receive more consistent, attuned and insightful parenting than he received in the care of his parents. The structure, boundaries and consistency he needs must be a priority for him to ensure that he does not revert to the emotional chaos which previously characterised his life to a great extent. 



g.	If the parents were able to support him, his experience of them in contact might well be excellent and therefore his own relationship with them might take on a more positive and meaningful character than their care of him provided. There would be less scope for mixed messages to be given to him once finality had been secured. 



The detriments of long-term foster care for CM can be viewed as follows:-

 



a.	He would lose the chance of being brought up with the love of his parents and his extended family.



b.	He would lose the regular warmth and affection he receives during contact and the link with his family would be seriously diluted if I agree to the reduction of contact proposed by the local authority and supported by the Guardian. However if the parents are able to work with professionals and learn about CM's needs and situation, there is some flexibility proposed as the case progresses, though clearly CM's own needs would dictate the path of contact in the future.

 

c.	He would on either scenario lose the good relationship with his current carers. If he were to go into long-term foster-care, there would be a double loss for him of regular contact with his parents and family, and the care he currently receives. Such losses cannot be underestimated.

 

d.	Given CM's challenging behaviour, as well as the vagaries of the option of long-term foster-care, there is a risk that his placement will break down, perhaps more than once. That risk however needs to be balanced against the risk of a breakdown were he to be placed with his parents which on the evidence is the greater risk.  The view of the Guardian is that the parents would be extremely anxious about the possibility of breakdown and that in itself would affect their care of CM, and his view is that the risk is higher than the risk which would be run if her were to be placed in long-term foster-care. Were a foster-placement to break down the care plan would allow for planned and supported change. Were a placement back home to fail, that might not be the case. It would be utterly devastating for CM and his parents. 

 

e.	A placement in foster-care would not meet his express wish to go home but this is not a full reflection of his ambiguous and complex feelings. . His experiences of parenting at home as evidenced however highlight the difference between love and good parenting and I am satisfied that he did not receive good parenting when he lived with his parents.



Turning to the option of a return to his parents the benefits would be:-

 



a.	CM would be at home and loved by his parents with support from their family members, as was previously the case. 



b.	This would match his wish to go home which he has expressed to Sylvia Duncan and the Guardian. He is nearly 8 years old and that is an important feature, but it is qualified by the nature of his experiences at home and his expressed fears. 



c.	The parents say that they would parent him differently now. The home is clean now. The question is whether they have made any of the changes in understanding and parenting which led to CM's removal. They say that have, and were that to be the case, it would be right for CM to go back home. 



d.	The parents' relationship appears to be strong and supportive now on their account, but there have been issues of domestic violence, witnessed by CM in the past which they ascribe to the stresses they were under when Mr M went bankrupt and the business was lost. 



 The detriments would be:-

 

a.	The parents might struggle as they did previously without their needs being addressed. The evidence of the Guardian and Sylvia Duncan and HB is that he would be at further risk of significant harm if this happened. The view of Miss Duncan which I accept is that his enormous anxieties are met by parental anxiety and not contained � the more anxious he becomes the more aggressive he becomes and the more anxious the parents become the more resistant CM becomes and he lashes out � she described this as a vicious circle.  She told me that it was likely that he would regress if returned home. Given his significant progress that would be extremely detrimental to his development. HB confirmed that in her view if he went home "conditions would probably deteriorate again within a short period of time and become unacceptable without professional intervention".



b.	There would be a need for an extremely high level of support, possibly daily. The parents say ( I believe that they sincerely mean) that they want any support they are given, but in the past they have found the intervention of the local authority unacceptable and challenging. 



c.	 In addition there would be a need for orders in my judgment given the level of need and risk were that to happen. A vicious circle would arise if a care order were to be made as the local authority would need to be satisfied that such a placement was, under the regulations, appropriate and safe. Their view is that it would not be and therefore CM would not be placed at home. A supervision order would not have the teeth of a care order, and the local authority would not share parental responsibility with the parents in a case where on any analysis the parents have struggled to such a degree and put CM's health security and safety at risk to the point that it is likely that he has been damaged by the experience. 





d.	There would I accept be a real risk of a placement at home breaking down which would be a devastating outcome for CM and his parents. Any support from their family would have to be not only robust, but at a greater and more attuned level than it was prior to CM being taken into care. There would need in my judgment to be a high level of supervision and engagement with the local authority by the extended family, and they would be required to be vigilant and if necessary report any return to previous damaging behaviours by the parents. 



e.	The parents would both need to successfully engage in appropriate treatments for themselves whilst caring for CM. To date the mother has accessed one session of hypnotherapy and is signed up for more. She has diagnosed Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy in herself. Of course that is not a valid diagnosis but were that or any similar syndrome with an up-to-date title proven to be the case, it would have the most serious implications for CM's safety in her care if it were to be unaddressed. It is right that there are references to the mother fabricating illness and the chronology reveals the patterns of anxiety and medical referrals which were so detrimental to CM in the past. There would be a significant risk to CM if he were exposed once again to the fruitless medical quest his parents embarked on.



f.	The parents are extremely anxious and the underlying reasons for this have not been addressed. The father is not a well or active person and his mobility problems mean that much of the physical care and managing of CM would fall to the mother. In the past she has been overwhelmed by the task of keeping the home clean. As CM grows he will be physically and emotionally challenging. His educational needs will need to be supported skillfully and patiently and his social needs will require tactful and appropriate handling by those caring for him. He will need carers who do not resort to physical punishment and who are able to explain things to CM in a way he understands. In my judgment he needs the care of people who are very resourceful and who accept and understand the need to access support from professionals, things which to date have sadly been largely beyond the parents. 



g.	Were the standard of parenting CM requires to dip on any front it would be harmful. He requires carers who are constantly available for him and who can weather his storms and outbursts in a detached and appropriate way, without being overridden by their own emotions, without resorting to inappropriate physical or verbal chastisement and without finding themselves emotionally challenged  and completely stressed out as these parents have been when he loses control. He needs in my judgment specific and consistent messages and handling so that he feels increasingly safe and contained.  CM has put himself and others in danger. It is lucky that so far no one has been seriously injured during one of his outbursts. He needs carers who do not give into his demands to keep the peace and who can help him to understand where he stands and why. Without that, he would be lost to his own overwhelming feelings. Sylvia Duncan states that his aggression is a reaction to his parents' anxieties. If that occurred again when he was in their care there would be a risk to those caught in the emotional storm of huge damage � to CM because he would be back to his most distressing behaviours, and suffering emotional damage and the risk of serious physical harm, and to the parents because they would be so seriously anxious about what was happening and also at risk of physical harm from him.



h.	CM's mother has not addressed her underlying difficulties with telling the truth. The importance of accurate reporting in relation to CM is vital. She was convicted in relation to a false allegation of rape when she was 18.  I know that this was a long time ago. The press report indicates that her psychological problems and an "intense imagination" were relied upon by her Counsel in mitigation. She said that she was a child who because of her upbringing sought and craved attention. She was seen as high risk and in need of psychiatric help and she was given a non-custodial sentence on condition that she sought help for her mental health problems. I note therefore that the traits still identifiable in the mother have been present for many years.



i.	Her family say that she lied as a teenager; there are many examples of her reporting medical issues about herself or about CM and even about Mr M.  The father says she exaggerates. M Primary School reported that she made very unusual statements about CM's health and were worried she was prescribing and administering medication herself. She was reported to have told parents that a teacher was dying of a brain tumor and she had visited him in hospital.   This is a very long-standing and deep seated problem and of course the implications for CM if she were to resume caring for him are that it might all start again, leaving a trail of confusion as to where the truth lies. Dr Perera reported that on 25th  June 2013 he was given unreliable evidence by the mother about the history. He has stated: a diagnosis of ADHD cannot be safely relied on because it relied a lot on the history given by Mrs M. He  reported that the parents could not be trusted to meet CM's needs "because of their own psychological and self-reported physical health problems." He was obliged to review and amend his diagnoses because of the unreliable history he had been given and as a result CM does not have medication. 



j.	CM's parents have been very resistant to advice and intervention in the past though they say that this has changed. It is hard to see how they would cope with the necessary degree of intervention in their lives. They have had issues with JB, whom F describes as "superior" and about whom a complaint  about rudeness was made, and with HB, who it is said was supercilious towards them. I make no findings but there is a pattern of them objecting to social workers and work, of not fully engaging and of becoming defensive when challenged. This would make the situation very difficult if not untenable and it is likely that similar difficulties would arise in future.



k.	Despite their concessions, I have not yet heard anything which makes me think that they really understand that, as Dr Perera stated, their parenting was having a severe impact on CM's emotional and behavioural difficulties. Without that understanding, or a real understanding and commitment to changing their ways radically, CM would be at risk. They have in the past, due to their anxieties and inability to meet CM's parenting needs appropriately, resorted to medical help for explanations, and intervention by way of medication for CM's problems. He does not need medication. It would be detrimental to him if the parents' issues as regards his medical needs were to re-emerge and in my judgment without further work and real acknowledgment and understanding of this anxious perception and approach to his health that dynamic is at risk of returning



I am quite satisfied on all the evidence that the possibility of a return home for CM is not an option, where the minuses so greatly outweigh the pluses, which I can safely endorse for the following reasons and findings:-

 



l.	CM's identified needs are very great. His emotional needs have not been met and will best be met by consistent, caring, skilled carers who are available to him. Sadly his parents have not been able to meet those needs in the past and whilst I know that they have strived in contact to understand and meet his needs, nevertheless their own unaddressed needs and lack of insight into his means that they are unlikely to make the radical changes he requires to be safely parented at an emotional level. His physical needs have not been met � he was living in conditions which limited his enjoyment of the available space. In addition his physical safety is at risk during one of his outbursts and unless they are properly contained and supported he may harm himself or others. His difficulties compound the risks and he has needed and will need appropriate medical and professional attention and support. This has been a major issue. He is not now medicated but he has been through the medical mill, and any future interventions will need to be absolutely appropriate. He will need help with any eating issues in order to be kept safe and healthy. Any developmental delay will need appropriate input and support. His educational needs and his identified difficulties need attuned and skillful support, as do the social aspects of school life and friendship.

 

m.	Sadly his parents have not been able to understand these needs and nothing that I have heard from them convinces me that they have grown sufficiently in their understanding to allow them to recognise those needs and meet them in the way CM requires. Neither of them have in any real sense addressed their own needs and serious issues and in reality I do not think that they have as yet really understood that such a need exists. They feel that they have done what is needed themselves.

 

n.	The evidence is that this is just not the case despite their genuine beliefs. I find as a matter of fact that the parents are unable to meet CM's complex needs, because they are so overwhelmed by their own deep and unaddressed difficulties that he would be at risk of significant harm were he to be returned to their care.  It is overwhelming evidence and the local authority have proved their case.



I find on all the evidence that the only way forward for CM to receive safe and steady parenting which is likely to see him realise his potential immediately, is to remain in the care of the Local Authority. They must not fail him. He has done very well so far which is a good pointer, and I am reassured by and record that there is a "money is no object" approach here which is also vital. The Independent Reviewing Officer needs to bear in mind that I approve the care plan because I have to invest confidence in that assertion, and were resources for CM to become an issue, were he not to receive the very best attention during the perilous journey into long-term foster-care, then he would have been let down by a hollow promise to the court. 

 



As for the care plan as regards contact, the level proposed is really minimal. Contact has stirred up behaviours before and after in CM and the care plan is prudent in my judgment at present because he will need to adjust to his permanent placement without too being upset � I believe it will have the best chance of holding if he can root himself firmly at first. 

 



The parents have not always respected the need not to raise with CM in contact issues about his future which despite their explanations have been concerning. If contact is to succeed as it is hoped and intended they will need to be helped to see things from CM's point of view, something they have really struggled with. If they can do so I am sure that contact will become the beneficial experience which it is intended to be, and CM will enjoy his special visits and the way will be paved for a purposeful   healthy and enduring relationship. Contact will be reviewed. I hope that the parents will engage with the Local Authority and listen and try to understand the things they will be told about CM and how he is doing so they can make the most of the experience and support CM.  It will be hard but I believe that they will be capable of that. 

 



I note that the Guardian was concerned about the initial regular provision of respite care because he believes that if that is a ready option it may undermine the need for the "glue to set" when CM is placed. He says, and the local authority agree, that provision for respite care and the introduction of future respite carers is an acceptable aspect of the care plan, but respite care should not be a ready option initially, rather an available provision in due course. CM has in this placement really enjoyed respite care. That is encouraging as regards his ability to make changes, but I agree with the view of the Guardian that in a permanent placement it should not be an early planned resource, rather something which may come in time when the placement is solid. 

 



CONTACT



There is a lot of evidence about contact. HB and Sylvia Duncan observed it and reported in some detail about the dynamics. Sylvia Duncan said that this was probably the best time CM had spent with his parents.  It has many positives and the parents clearly try their hardest to make it a good and loving experience for CM. They are criticised for a number of issues � that Mr M is not always engaged with CM, that they have said things to him which are potentially confusing or indicate promises which might not happen about going home, or that there are sometimes tensions between themselves, or that they are inconsistent � a recent example given was of the mother saying to CM that he could not have a pound, but then giving him one in exchange for a kiss. CM enjoys contact, but there have been times when he has not wanted to go or reacted to it in a challenging way.

 



In my judgment it is in his best interests for contact to happen and to be regularly reviewed to see if it is working for him. It will require some additional effort on behalf of the parents to support CM in the future in circumstances which they do not at this time agree are in his best interests. Sylvia Duncan took the view that as long as the parents were supportive of CM there should not be a break in contact to allow him to settle. She was clear that if the parents are unable to accept the situation then there may be an argument for no contact at all.

 



In my judgment that would be a very tragic outcome for CM. It is likely that the parents will find it very hard to accept and understand this decision, and I sympathise with them for what will be a profound blow. I know they have tried very hard. However they are going to have to heed the dire warning of Sylvia Duncan. It is going to be up to them to make sure that they work their hardest and overcome a lot of feelings to make sure that the things they say and do when they have contact with CM do not impact harmfully on him. They will have to leave a lot of their own feelings and issues at the door

 



It will take CM time, possibly years, to bed into a new family and that must be given the best chance of success. I notice that in a previous position statement Mrs M was hoping for contact 4 times a year. She now wants more, possibly because she has realised the bleakness of her situation where her hopes for caring for her child have been remote. They wish to have monthly contact.

 





Because it is so crucial that CM has the chance to settle and develop the strongest possible roots, I accept the evidence of the Guardian who has supported the increase from the original proposals that for now four times a year direct contact for his parents with indirect contact at birthday and Christmas. Two occasions will be contact just between themselves and CM, but two further occasions will be together with the paternal grandmother BF. She will have an additional visit once a year on her own with CM and there will be a further visit for the paternal grandfather and his wife, TM and LM, on their own, making a total of six visits a year. I note that there is no provision for any indirect contact between CM and his grandparents. I would see no harm to him from a similar arrangement for his grandparents to send a card to him on his birthday and at Christmas or he may feel that they have forgotten him. I hope this can be discussed. 

 



I think that 6 family visits a year is likely to be the very maximum for now which will strike the right balance for CM and allow him to settle. The reviews will ensure that this is monitored and if necessary  contact can be adjusted to meet his needs.

 



I have considered the need for an order and I am wholly satisfied that a care order is the right and proportionate order. 

 



FINALLY, I am going to deliver a message to CM which does not form part of this judgment.

JUDGMENT

 

1.                 
THE JUDGE:� This is my judgment on
this open court application by Staffordshire County Council seeking a reporting
restriction order.� I propose to deliver the judgment in anonymised terms for
obvious reasons in an open court case.

2.                 
The application was served on the
mother, the father and the maternal grandmother but none of them have attended
or responded to the court.� My attention has been drawn to an entry on the
grandmother�s Facebook page dated 14th December 2013 which is a clear indication that she has received this application and further that she
opposes the relief sought.

3.                 
The child is 2 years old and on 23rd May 2013 the Family Proceedings Court made her the subject of care and
placement orders.� There had been extensive assessments of the problems faced
by these parents.� The mother and the father came to the courageous and wise
decision that they would not oppose the local authority�s plan for their child
to be placed for adoption.� The maternal grandmother had a different view and
she made an application to the court for an order that she should care for the
child.� The grandmother was also the subject of extensive assessment which
concluded that the child should not be placed with her.

4.                 
At the end of the day the mother
and the father opposed the grandmother at the Family Proceedings Court when she
challenged the recommendation that the child should not be placed with her.�
The grandmother was unsuccessful at that court and appealed to the County
Court.� The case was listed before me and the grandmother was again
unsuccessful.� She appealed my decision to the Court of Appeal and once more,
on 29th November 2013, the grandmother was unsuccessful.� No further
challenge is available to the grandmother.� Under the placement order the child
has now been placed with prospective adopters.

5.                 
The grandmother is clearly very
disappointed by this outcome and she has complained that the outcome is
unfair.� No one suggests that the grandmother should be prevented from
commenting on this saga or from criticising the local authority or the court.�
However, the local authority says that the grandmother has gone beyond that.�
They say that she has caused harm to the child by using her name and her
photograph.� Examples have been shown to me.� I have seen the grandmother�s
Facebook postings in the bundle at C13, C15 and C17.� There is a further very
relevant Facebook posting at the back of the local authority�s written
submissions, an entry which I am told is dated 13th December 2013
and starts by an indication that it was posted 11 hours ago.� In addition the
grandmother has started an online petition bearing the name and photograph of
the child.� Details are in the bundle at C17.� The grandmother has contributed
to an internet radio station where there was a discussion forum to which the
grandmother contributed the name of the child.� This is accessible from a link
which appears on page C19 of the bundle.

6.                 
The local authority�s application
for a reporting restriction order seeks to prevent this identification of the
child but otherwise does not seek to prevent discussion, comment and criticism
of the local authority and court processes.

7.                 
I have open in front of me the
President�s recent judgment in the Staffordshire case of Re: J [2013] EWHC 2694 (Fam).� I also have a full copy of the order that was granted at the
conclusion of that hearing.� Today�s application by the same local authority
largely follows the order granted by the President at the conclusion of that
hearing.� There are a few small modifications sufficiently addressed in
argument which represent no departure in principle.� I unhesitatingly adopt the
President�s account of the legal framework and relevant considerations which I
read in the old judgment from paragraph 20 onwards.� 

8.                 
In a short judgment at an uncontested
hearing I can summarise briefly that I accept the very important principle that
open and public debate about the family justice system is essential in our
society.� I apply the guidance given by the President together with the earlier
guidance in the case of Re: S [2004].� My task is to balance the right
to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the European Convention of Human
Rights and the right to respect for private and family life under Article 8 of
the same Convention.� Neither Article takes precedence over the other.� In the
event of conflict there must be intense focus on the competing importance of
the rights claimed.� The claimed justifications for interference with each
right must be taken into account.� A proportionality test must be applied,
which represents the ultimate balancing test.� The best interests of the child
are not paramount but are, nevertheless, a primary consideration.

9.                 
The importance of the Article 10
right to freedom of expression is self-evident.� The importance in the context
of the family justice system has been stressed by the President in the judgment
to which I have made reference and I adopt those points.� The application of
Article 8 in the present case is more subtle.� This child has a qualified right
to privacy and family life.� The courts of this country have decided that her
future lies in adoption, which means that she has a qualified right to
successful, stable, undisturbed family life within adoption.

10.             
The evidence presented to me
leaves me in no doubt that the grandmother has embarked upon a campaign to
undermine these rights enjoyed by the child.� The Facebook entry of 13th December 2013 attached to the written submissions can only be described as
a call for others to help a search for the depicted child in her new adoptive
placement.� The accompanying text and other text refer to the child as a stolen
child but by that date the Court of Appeal had determined that the plan for
adoption could not be challenged.� This kind of publication is very harmful at
a number of levels.� It is harmful to the child in the present if the search
established her whereabouts and led to disturbance and destabilisation.� It is
harmful in the present even if the search does not succeed in that it exposes
the prospective adopters to anxiety at a time when the child�s best interests
would be served by them accepting her into their household from a standpoint of
emotional stability.� It is very harmful to the child in the future in that
these internet postings can remain so that when a little older and accessing
the internet herself the child may encounter these destabilising messages and
find her own wellbeing undermined.� Alternatively these postings might be
accessed by friends of the child and form the basis of comment or even bullying.

11.             
I remind myself that the courts of
the land at the highest level have determined that placement for adoption is
the only appropriate outcome for this child and an outcome which is inherently
lawful.� In these circumstances it is clear that Article 8 and Article 10 are
in conflict.� Both represent important rights.� However, as so often in these
cases, a proportionate balanced reconciliation emerges.� The right to freedom
of expression does not need the elements of personal identification which are so
harmful.� The right to respect for family and private life does need a
prohibition to be placed upon identification but does not need to prevent all
comment and debate.� It is clear to me that the proportionate outcome is to
allow discussion but to prevent identification.

12.             
This application is made to me
under the inherent jurisdiction.� It is clear to me that the provisions of
section 100 are met to allow the application to proceed.� Automatic restraint
under the statute comes to an end with the termination of the proceedings.� The
proceedings have ended but the need for restraint remains.� The posting of 13th December 2013 followed the unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Appeal
on 29th November 2013.

13.             
A personal order addressed to the
grandmother would not, in my judgment, be sufficient to address the crucially
important need to protect the child�s privacy.� It seems clear to me that an
order is needed to bind third parties.

14.             
As to duration this is not a case
in which the need for protection is going to slip away with the passage of
time.� Indeed, arguably, as the child gets older and reaches a position where
she would understand comments and criticisms in the world around her, the need
for protection would be the greater.� So, as in Re: J [2013] EWHC 2694 (Fam),
restraint until the child�s eighteenth birthday is appropriate.� As in Re: J
I am persuaded that the fact that material is in the public domain already
is no protection against the infliction of further harm.� As in Re: J I
adopt the appropriate procedure concerning the restraint of persons overseas.

15.             
There is one area in which I find
the present case to differ from the President�s case of Re: J [2013] EWHC 2694 (Fam).� In that case the restraint of publication of photographs of a
tiny baby was considered to be inappropriate.� The present case I find to be
very different.� This child is significantly older and correspondingly easier
to identify from photographs.� Indeed, the grandmother has used a photograph as
part of her campaign to seek out the whereabouts of the prospective adoptive
placement.� This is one of the most harmful aspects of the case and an element
from which the child needs protection.� Carrying out the same balancing
exercise as did the President I reach a different conclusion and find that the
publication of photographs must be restrained alongside the publication of
names.

16.             
In the course of argument a
refined draft order emerged which I find it necessary to grant to the local
authority today.� There will be a clause in that order providing that the local
authority will obtain, file and serve on all parties a transcript of this
judgment.

17.������ I shall
conclude with a note addressed to the grandmother. I am sorry that she has chosen
not to attend court today. There may be points which she could raise which are
relevant to my decision. I have done my best in her absence to anticipate them.
However if there are other points I invite her to apply to the court. The worst
thing she could do would be to act in breach of this order and only when steps
are taken to enforce the order against her, to raise points which should have
been raised today. The order does not prevent campaigning, discussion or
debate. However as in many other cases, these must not include the use of the
true names or photographs of the child as this would be harmful to her.

Approved 24/1/14

HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT APPROVED BY THE COURT

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with the welfare of B, a girl born on [a date in] February 2013.  Newcastle City Council on 28th June 2013 issued an application for a care order.  It presents to the court a plan of permanence for B by way of a placement order leading to adoption.  The plan is opposed by B's mother, M, who was born on 21st November 1992 and quite recently turned 21 and she denies that grounds exist for the making of such an order and seeks a return of B to her care.  

 

B's father is not known with any certainty.  When B's birth was registered the mother identified him as F1, a man with whom the mother had been in a relationship and who did not seek to deny paternity.  However, there was a degree of uncertainty and that was resolved decisively by a DNA test carried out which excluded him as the father.  That has consequences for the court to deal with.  By virtue of his name being on the birth certificate, he has automatically acquired parental responsibility for a child which is not his.  B has been given the surname of a man who is not her father and in respect of whom there is no proposal by anyone that he play a part in her life.  I believe that he did see her when she was a very small baby but he has not developed any kind of relationship with her.  Accordingly I am asked, and no one seeks to oppose, to make a declaration of non-parentage and to give permission to the Local Authority to change B's surname.  

 

In the alternative the mother says that F2 is B's father.  He was contacted some time ago, advised to seek legal advice and although numerous attempts have been made to contact him, and consistent contact with him has not proved possible, he told the social worker that he did not wish to take any steps that created an ongoing link between him and the mother, he did not want to care for B and any contact that he had with B ran the risk of exposing him to, as he put it, "volatility and grief".  He has been written to.  Whilst there is some uncertainty as to whether more recent correspondence has been received, the social worker's visits to his last known home on six occasions have not resulted in any further contact.  He is believed to be in a new relationship and to be the father, or about to become the father, of a child of that relationship.  Unsatisfactory though it is, the Local Authority and the guardian have satisfied me that all reasonable steps have been taken to ascertain B's paternity and in the unsatisfactory circumstances that I have described, it has to be acknowledged that B's father is not known.

 

B's guardian is Marion Harris and she supports the Local Authority case which she, like all others, emphasise is a particularly sad one.  Why does the Local Authority say that B is likely to suffer significant harm and that the likelihood of that harm is because B would not receive care that would be reasonably expected from a parent?  This mother has had a very difficult start to life indeed.  Described as extremely vulnerable, she had a dysfunctional childhood in a chaotic family home with a violent and alcoholic father and a mother who effectively rejected her.  B is, in fact, her third child.  C died in 2009 within two hours of birth.  A was removed from her care at birth and he lives with his paternal grandparents under a special guardianship order made in 2012.  B resided with her mother following her discharge from hospital until June when she was received into care.  

 

A common feature of each of the mother's pregnancies has been very premature babies.  B was born at 30 weeks which is, in fact, the longest pregnancy to date, following C born at 23 weeks and A at 27.  The cause for these premature babies is not known but it did, however, have the consequence of B remaining in hospital for the first six weeks of her life, being discharged to the mother's care in mid April.  It has to be said, however, that these obstetric problems are not the concern in particular focus.

 

The mother had been known by children's services from 2009 when she moved into the care of North Tyneside Council, it is said, because her mother was unable to manage her care.  She was then 20 weeks pregnant.  Assessments were undertaken as to her ability to live independently, her poor eating habits and her poor personal hygiene and a particular concern was her continued relationship with the father of that baby, C, F3, despite having been informed that he had been convicted of sexual offences.  It appeared that she was unable to appreciate the risk that was thereby created.  

 

Of course, sadly, C died shortly after birth and so that particular concern went away but the children's services again became involved in January of 2011 just prior to A's birth.  He was born with medical problems.  He was in hospital for the first three months of his life but was discharged to foster care before being moved to the home of his paternal grandparents.  He was never cared for by his mother because assessments concluded that she was unable to care for him given her mental health problems and her inability to demonstrate that she recognised the concerns that professionals had.  It appears that the mother ended her relationship with F3 at about that time but was described as living a transient lifestyle, moving backwards and forwards between the homes of the two men, the two putative fathers of B, F1 and F2.

 

On 29th September 2012 the mother notified the Local Authority that she was eight weeks pregnant.  The Local Authority swung into action, undertook an initial assessment and an initial child protection conference was held which resulted in the unborn baby being made the subject of a child protection plan under the category of neglect.  During her pregnancy the mother lived in Praxis which is a housing support service for homeless young people and a parenting assessment was undertaken.  There remained concerns about the mother's mental health.  That had been assessed in A's case by Dr�Tyrie, so an updated assessment was then sought but emerging from this process it was agreed that, were B to remain in her mother's care, intensive support would be required and the Local Authority was prepared to entertain that and a mother and baby unit was identified at Elizabeth House which is a facility provided by a charity (well known to the court) called Aquila Way for young mothers and babies and it was agreed by the Local Authority with the mother that she would move there on B's discharge from hospital.  Additional support was to be added, including the provision of a community foster carer and the mother moved to Elizabeth House at the end of April in anticipation of B's discharge from hospital.

 

The Local Authority says, although the mother denies this, that it became almost immediately apparent that the mother was, in fact, struggling to cope with day to day living arrangements within Elizabeth House, was struggling with the support that was being offered by community fostering and despite support from Gateshead Mental Health Services, from the 24 hour staff at Elizabeth House, community fostering, the health visitor and a nursery nurse provided by the health visitor.  Over the passage of time the concerns escalated.  The risk to B was perceived to increase along with the risk to other mothers and babies living at Elizabeth House and that resulted in the mother's eviction on 21st June.

 

Central to all of these concerns have been the issues regarding the mother's mental health.  As I have said, there was previously an assessment by Dr�Tyrie when A was born, a psychiatrist again well known to the court, who concluded that the mother suffered from a conduct disorder and had done so from an early age.  There were features of defined and disruptive behaviour along with what she described as more pervasive difficulties warranting a diagnosis of unsocialised conduct disorder together with the characteristics of an emotionally unstable personality disorder with features of both the borderline and impulsive type.  Predominating was the level of emotional instability and poor self image with a lack of insight into her difficulties and an inability to engage with services.  With time, a gradual reduction in the more troubling aspects could be expected to occur but Dr�Tyrie felt that that would not be within a time scale suitable for A.  She advised that the personality disorder rendered the mother incapable of caring for that child in an appropriate manner or to provide him with a physically and emotionally warm, consistent and safe environment.  She did not think that the mother could prioritise A's needs above her own such as to expose him to risk which she characterised as being emotional, physical and psychological.

 

The question of mental health was recognised as one that needed to be re-visited with the Local Authority reverting to Dr�Tyrie who saw the mother in late May at a time when B was living with her mother at Elizabeth House.  Dr�Tyrie noted that the mother had, in fact, made considerable progress.  Drawing from several sources, including detailed information from B's social worker, Paula Archbold, she noted the fact of the mother's self referral of her pregnancy to the Local Authority, of seeking and undertaking bereavement counselling with regards to C and her early engagement with the Local Authority, as well as noting how much more emotionally stable the mother was.  Her engagement with hospital during B's long hospitalisation was, along with her commitment to B, regarded as commendable.  

 

It was not, of course, universally positive as no one would have expected such but Dr�Tyrie summed it up thus: 

 

"By her own account and, indeed, this is supported in the report, there has been a reduction in some of the more worrying aspects of her previous presentation which, in layman's terms, may be described as an amelioration, although there are clearly still areas for concern.  On the positive side she has engaged well with all professionals, attended appointments and co-operated with the majority of demands placed upon her.  Her physical care of B is adequate.  She appears to be very emotionally attached and has responded well to her baby.  

On the negative it is clear that she does still have significant difficulties with interpersonal relationships.  She has a tendency to have short-lived, volatile relationships with older men.  Though not currently in a relationship, this does not mean that this is not a risk for the future.  This pattern of relationship development is undoubtedly a reflection of her own extremely dysfunctional childhood and absence of good parenting experiences.  She clearly has immense difficulties developing relationships within her own peer group, a tendency to verbal aggression, albeit this in itself may ameliorate over time with attendance at anger management.  In addition there is her vulnerability, her tendency to put herself in potentially dangerous situations with older people, her chaotic management of money which in the long term could lead to possible physical neglect, that is to say she has not got enough money to care for herself or her baby."  

Of the plan to progress through reducing levels of supported accommodation, Dr�Tyrie said that there would need to be a robust package of monitoring at least until B went to nursery.  

Shortly after that report the placement at Elizabeth House unfortunately broke down.  Dr�Tyrie, without seeing the mother again, was asked to comment on the documents available and she wrote an addendum on 20th August drawing on Local Authority records, the chronology and some information from Elizabeth House, albeit not the full logs which she only saw at court, as well as the parenting assessment which had then been completed and the initial analysis by the guardian for the hearing of what was a contested interim care application.  She reached a rather less encouraging conclusion.  She said that she remained of the same opinion in terms of the diagnosis but added: 

 

"Contrary to my previous opinion, noting her engagement particularly with professionals throughout this pregnancy, it would, in fact, appear that there has been a worrying change.  It is clear that [M] is again struggling to engage with professionals and struggling to deal with constructive advice with regard to provision of adequate physical care for B.  She responds in a defensive and, indeed, aggressive manner at times and this is in spite of her tearful concerns when I saw her of B being taken into care.  It is my view that [M] is emotionally attached to her baby but I would suggest that this is at the level of an attachment to an object of her own, that is something that is hers rather than anyone else's, which is more than can be said of most aspects of her life.  Anger management would go some way in helping her address her problems but certainly not all of her mental health problems and I have my doubts about capacity to attend and engage consistently.  

As I indicated in July of 2011, long term psychotherapy would be the desirable treatment and this needs to be likely long term, albeit I note that the National Health Service currently tends to restrict treatment to two years only.  A positive outcome is not always possible.  I am of the opinion that it is highly unlikely that [M] would attend and engage with such therapy over a long term period.  It is clear from the records that the package of care implemented with B's arrival was a fairly comprehensive one and that in spite of this and an awareness of the risk of B's removal, [M] has been unable in any way to moderate her behaviour and, therefore, I think that even with a long term, robust package of care and monitoring it must now be acknowledged that there would be a significant risk to the emotional, psychological and physical welfare of B if to be placed in the care of her mother."  

She ended by saying that she did not believe that the mother would cause direct, physical harm to a child in her care.  Nevertheless, the potential for a child to be caught in the crossfire due to one of her many angry altercations with others existed along with the potential for physical harm as a result of neglect of her physical care.

Subsequent to this report the final care plan was drawn up on 12th September.  The guardian reported on 20th September supporting the Local Authority case.  There has been regrettable delay and the final hearing listed on 10th December was vacated due to lack of court time, a fate that this hearing also nearly suffered but was fortunately averted by the unexpected collapse of another case this week.  The Local Authority continues to express its concerns.  Whilst contact was set at four times a week when the interim care order was made in accordance with the interim care plan, by September it had reduced to once or twice a week and it has remained set at once a week ever since on the mother giving notice that she was going to attend but it has only been taken up sporadically.  The mother has again had an unsettled and somewhat nomadic existence, variously living at Praxis on two separate occasions, in her own flat which she now seems to have abandoned and for at least two separate periods living with friends as she is at the present time.  It is perhaps worth noting that, having given evidence earlier in the week, she failed to attend the hearing yesterday when submissions were made apparently due to lack of funds to travel to the court.  It is regrettable that she is not present in court to hear this judgment being delivered.  It is doubly so given, as I was told shortly prior to approving this transcript, that M was apparently in the building, with Ms Archbold,  all along unaware of where the hearing was taking place despite a request for a message to be sent over the public address system.

 

Against this background I turn to the threshold.  That relied on is, in fact, the threshold found by this court on 16th July at the interim care application hearing on the basis that there were reasonable grounds for believing that B was at risk by reason of the facts found, the test under section 38(2) of the Children Act 1989.  The Local Authority invites me to the view that the court can now be satisfied of the same facts under section 31(2) of the Act.  The matters found were: 

 

(1) that the mother experienced a difficult and dysfunctional childhood and exhibited difficult and disruptive behaviour from an early age.  She was accommodated as a child due to her behaviour which her own mother was unable to manage, stating she was a risk to her siblings; 

(2) she had a diagnosis of unsocialised conduct disorder in childhood and an emotionally unstable personality disorder with mixed features of both borderline and impulsive type in early adulthood.  That diagnosis rendered her incapable of caring for A in an appropriate manner, being unable to provide consistent, physical and emotional care; 

(3) the emotionally unstable personality disorder in adulthood affects the way in which she sustains interpersonal relationships, copes with normal life stresses and relates to inappropriate manner within society.  She is prone to emotional outbursts, impulsivity, a chaotic lifestyle and in terms of her parenting abilities she has major difficulties in providing consistent, secure and emotionally warm parenting and secure boundaries; 

(4) those factors have been observed at the recent deterioration in her presentation at Elizabeth House; 

(5) B had been exposed to her extremely aggressive outbursts aimed at others, she is unpredictable and thereby unable to maintain a safe and secure environment for her.  Further, she is not thereby consistently emotionally available for the child; 

(6) on 21st June mother was evicted from Elizabeth House due to her behaviour.  That was a recurring pattern.  She had been threatened with eviction and on her third warning from St Helena's hostel in 2011 and was requested to leave Praxis in April of last year; 

(7) the mother struggled to meet her own basic needs and, finally, 

(8) she struggled to meet the basic needs of the child.

Whilst the mother makes certain key concessions (she does not, for example, challenge Dr�Tyrie's diagnoses), she does say that the diagnoses themselves do not prevent her from caring for B and, by way of other example, she admits being evicted from Elizabeth House but denies that the grounds were reasonable.  So it is, of course, necessary for the court to consider the evidence relating to each and to make findings before it can begin to consider whether and, if so, what orders can or should be made.  The court heard just four witnesses: the social worker, Paula Archbold, Dr�Tyrie; the mother and the guardian.  

 

Miss�Archbold has been the social worker throughout, the author of a very detailed parenting assessment completed, I see, after some 15� hours of direct assessment of the mother.  This is a considerable piece of work and it has to be said an achievement for the mother to have been able to engage in to its natural end.  The last session was in mid May.  Its completion was delayed pending Dr�Tyrie's initial report.  It is not possible to do justice in summary form to this 25 page document but suffice it to say there were a good number of positives indicating the progress the mother had made since A's birth but overall the conclusion was that the improvement was not such that the mother could care for a baby.  The mother's mental health concerns were variously ignored by her, disagreed with or minimised depending on the mother's mood such that it was the social worker's conclusion that she had not reached a level of stability necessary to care for a child safely in a nurturing or functional way so as to protect her and enable her to develop safely.

 

In her oral evidence she pointed to the inconsistency of care, the inability to remain focused, her problematic loss of temper, the risk of both physical and emotional harm, all unintentional but arising from her behaviour in respect of which she appeared unaware of its consequences.  This was all explored in some detail by Miss�Adcock for the mother.  The social worker credited the mother with spending the maximum possible time with B and bonding well with her during the very difficult and long stay in hospital, expressing milk, presenting a very different picture from her care of A but said that one could effectively overemphasise what occurred in hospital because it was a restricting and difficult environment for an assessment of M's ability to care, at least compared with that which followed in Elizabeth House

 

She agreed that Elizabeth House was an assessment centre as opposed to a permanent home and that there was anticipated to be an eight to twelve week stay but she was unwilling to accept Miss�Adcock's characterisation of an excessively restrictive regime.  In terms of going out and the like, she pointed out that B was still a very premature baby, (by my reckoning she only reached term at about 7th May) and thus there had to be some fairly obvious restrictions for simple health reasons.  She accepted that although there were conflicts over, for example, the time that the mother had to be back in Elizabeth House, she was generally compliant and if she was going to be late she phoned ahead to warn.  She also accepted that there was understandable frustration at the intensity of the supervision, albeit she would not agree with the mother's characterisation of it as her being trapped.  

 

She fully accepted that in being able to describe the mother as she did in her assessment as having come a long way, being pleasant, warm, likeable and keeping B safe in basic tasks as well as showing emotional warmth, that was an achievement for this mother but pointed out that this all had to be balanced against the risk that she had identified in the same section of her report of the mother being prone to lashing out, shouting, crying and pacing around with B in her arms, on an occasion rocking, even shaking her vigorously, thereby quite unintentionally exposing her to both physical and emotional harm.  

 

Miss�Archbold denied that the mother was evicted from Elizabeth House simply because of suspected alcohol and cannabis use; rather she said issues had arisen daily or almost daily with varying degrees of severity but in such a way that it resulted in the staff there concluding that other children were at risk from her behaviour.  Whilst some of the mother's more florid remarks such as threatening to get drunk and use drugs could have been in the nature of throwaway remarks, she could not simply dismiss them as such because of the mother's history of doing exactly such things in the not too distant past.  She denied the suggestion that the mother's behaviour had been exaggerated and said that increasingly the mother did not co-operate.  The community foster carer, assigned to the mother for three hours a day five days a week, was increasingly concerned, as were the staff at Elizabeth House and in denying that the assessment there ended prematurely she said that, if anything, it was permitted to last too long because of the increasing concerns about B's well-being, not least over matters of basic care, cleanliness and hygiene.  

 

Those points were picked up by Miss�Cowell on behalf of the guardian and multiple references to aspects of basic care were highlighted with the possible link of B being taken to hospital three times with stomach problems.  She felt that the quality of basic care when B was initially in hospital had perhaps been attributable to the high level of support that she got there and that even in Elizabeth House the contribution of the community foster carer also resulted in, perhaps, an exaggeration in the quality of care that was perceived to come from the mother.  Thus, as she said, B could be nicely presented, well dressed and clean in her pram but go into her room and it would be found to be in complete chaos, dirty, untidy and smelly due to rotten food and discarded, used nappies.

 

She also drew attention to confusing contradictions regarding the circumstances in which the mother had moved out of the flat, the tenancy of which she had obtained and others had moved into, a report from Praxis that she moved back because she could not cope and her vulnerability to people generally and men in particular who took advantage of her.  Despite the mother's claims that her family supported her, the social worker believed that the maternal grandmother had only visited the hospital once or twice after B was born and no other family member ever visited and that, along with her own assessment of the maternal grandmother, to which I will briefly come, demonstrated how isolated she is.

 

The maternal grandmother had been assessed as an alternative carer at the mother's request.  It was a negative assessment.  I have already mentioned the mother's difficult childhood.  The poor nature of the relationship emerges from the assessment.  MGM had variously called the mother a liar, had described having to keep her from the family home at times due to her behaviour which her husband could not always manage.  Frequent arguments had caused her to ask the mother to leave because she simply could not manage her behaviour.  

 

Dr�Tyrie gave evidence.  She confirmed the opinions I have already summarised and noted, with sadness, how the earlier good signs had not been maintained.  It was her assessment that for B to live safely with her mother she would need 24 hour care, pointing to the difficulties that arose at Elizabeth House despite the support of staff and others.  She said that the chaos in her early life rendered it very difficult for the mother to take responsibility, to make plans or to organise things.  That the mother was undergoing anger management would be helpful, as would psychological therapy, but it would need to be intensive and it would take time and she said, "I think she would struggle to maintain it".  The level of support she would need would reduce the risk of physical harm to B but the emotional risk remained from outbursts of temper as well as her concerns about consistent mother and baby interaction.  She felt that such a level of intense support would need to last until B was old enough to speak about things for herself.

 

When questioned by Miss�Adcock, she fully accepted that she had been initially more optimistic about the mother for the reasons I have touched on but those concerns remained even if it is was going in the right direction.  She was disinclined to characterise the support at Elizabeth House as intrusive, pointing out that she would expect someone placed in such an environment at least to have the insight and willingness to co-operate with such a regime, however irksome, as part of the process of learning and moving on.  She agreed that a multi-agency approach to support the mother and monitoring was necessary but she did not retreat from her view as to the intensity of the support that would be required.  

 

She agreed on being shown the notes from Elizabeth House that they were far from being unremittingly negative but pointed out the problem of sustaining the positives over a long period of time and so the negatives remained critical to the assessment of risk and those negatives were concerning because they involved behaviour that could potentially affect the care of B, notwithstanding her clear view that there would be no intentional hurt.  Examples of the behaviour as described, such as the incident on 6th June which resulted in the Local Authority first asking the mother to agree to B being accommodated, as described by Elizabeth House at any rate, were, she said, classical of persons with the mother's psychological profile which one would hopefully be able to reduce by therapy if there was insight.

 

The mother gave evidence.  Her statement filed in September described how she felt that she had matured considerably since A was born and had significantly improved her behaviour such that she could recognise and respond to B's needs.  Whilst pleased to have been given the chance to go to Elizabeth House, she felt that it was too pressured and she felt suffocated, trapped and isolated from others.  She denied most of the complaints about her there but accepted that she was sometimes angry and moody due to the effect of suffocation and isolation.  She accepted her anger and mental health issues and was accessing therapy via her leading care worker.  She challenged the Local Authority's conclusion that she had presented a risk of harm to B and criticised Dr�Tyrie's apparent about turn from her report to the addendum offering to do whatever it was that was required to care for B.  

 

She gave evidence at some length.  It was hard for her, entirely understandably.  There were frequent tears and one break.  She is not unintelligent, she is quite articulate, she is capable of being quite feisty.  Her devotion to her daughter shone through.  She said, "I loved every minute of looking after B".  She cut a very sympathetic figure.  She said that she thought she had managed B perfectly fine to her knowledge.  She had learned to budget, to meet day to day needs.  She had been shown how to keep a food diary and it was really helpful.  She had had a nursery nurse and the health visitor weekly to assist with an understanding of medical needs.  She said, in contrast to what the social worker had said, that she was presently in reasonable health and had no concerns on that score.  Going to the nub of the threshold, she said that the diagnoses that she accepted did not prevent her from being able to care for her children, Dr�Tyrie and the social worker were wrong and the incidents that had been described had all been made to sound far more extreme leading to unfair criticism.  

 

When she was cross-examined, in relation to A she said that she had thought she could care for him but following his removal she realised that she had not been stable, was immature and not in the right frame of mind but things were different now.  She acknowledged she needed support for certain things and other things had to happen before B could come into her care.  She identified those as engaging in therapy, undertaking anger management and controlling her temper better.  It was suggested to her that there was a risk of harm to B if she was exposed to an argument and she said: 

 

"I would never harm her.  What you would do is put B in a safe place and out of the way because otherwise she would be affected by it."

She denied the suggestion that she might inadvertently put her at risk of harm.  She denied that B had ever been at risk of physical harm, she had not rocked her vigorously, she did not recall an occasion when she was asked to hand her over because of that to a worker and she denied that there had been an incident where B's head had nearly hit a door frame as she stormed out of a room.  Essentially she said that everything that has been alleged against her was not true and that the Local Authority had wanted B out of her care from day one.

She said that she did get agitated on occasions in Elizabeth House but had not lost her temper.  She sought to draw a distinction between being annoyed and stressed as opposed to a loss of temper where you, as she put it, "lose it altogether and go crazy".  If that happened she would call the crisis team and put B in her cot and punch the pillow.  She agreed that she had shouted and sworn in front of B in Elizabeth House but said it did not happen every day.  She recognised the need to change.  She drew attention to all that she had been through.  She became very, very upset at that point and we had a break.  After that she said she could not identify any risk of harm to B, her behaviour was not as bad as the Local Authority said and she denied losing her temper at Elizabeth House. 

 

Since leaving Elizabeth House she denied there were any concerns.  She had calmed right down, she had the odd drink but did not drink heavily.  She said, "I either do nothing or go to contact".  She told the court that she had been in her own flat from 7th October but then moved out because she thought she might have a better chance if she went to Praxis where there was support.  She had coped fine in the flat, she did not need the 24 hour care that was suggested by Dr�Tyrie.  It was put to her by reference to previous placements that there was a pattern of struggling to cope and she denied that and she said that if she could go to a place like Gloucester Way, a Praxis facility for mothers and babies, she would manage perfectly well.

 

The guardian's role was primarily concerned with welfare.  Characterising the reported behaviour of the mother as volatile and changeable, she supported the application for the interim care order and expressed concern regarding what she called "the state of flux" in the mother's life since she had left Praxis, her failure to attend a pre-arranged meeting with her at her solicitor's office and, indeed, when she attended at that office learning that the mother had failed to keep other appointments with her solicitor.  The guardian had met the mother subsequently when living in her flat which she said was clean, tidy and nicely decorated.  Albeit the mother was in a better place in her life, she was not convinced that she was ready for a settled lifestyle.  

 

On a purely factual level the guardian was not able to confirm the mother's account of the reason why she missed quite so much contact.  She had only attended twice for certain, once more possibly since mid December and the mother explained that by reason of what she called B's "attachment issues" that caused B to be upset if the mother was ever out of her sight and, particularly, when she puts her coat on at the end of contact.  Whilst the mother said that B is upset and that in turn upsets her, it was primarily to spare B that upset that she absented herself from contact, what was characterised on her behalf as being a child-focused thing to do.  I need to consider this but, at this stage, the social worker, having refuted what the mother said both from speaking with the contact supervisor and seeing the records, the guardian said that she was present throughout a contact in October, including at the end, and witnessed no such upset or distress on B's part.

 

I need to make some findings now.  The law is set out in a series of authorities beginning with Re H and R (Child Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)[1],  and then latterly with Re B (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof)[2] in the House of Lords.  It is not necessary to set out the law at length.  There is no need for me to do so.  I need to set out only so much as is necessary to indicate the standards by which I have to assess the evidence and equally importantly as to enable the mother to understand the legal principles by which she is being judged.  I am entitled to and must have regard to all the evidence before me when coming to conclusions on matters of fact (that is Re U (Serious Injury: Standard of Proof)[3].).  The standard of proof was classically defined by Lord Nicholls in Re H and R as being the balance of probability where a court is satisfied an event occurred if the court considers that, on the evidence, the occurrence of the event was more likely than not.  That was reviewed by the House of Lords in Re B and the court disapproved what had become the familiar formula of the more serious the allegation, the more cogent the evidence needed to prove it.  Lord Hoffmann set out very clearly what he described as a binary system where there are only two values, a fact happened or it did not.  That, therefore, is the standard that is applied.  The burden, of course, rests on the Local Authority.

 

Whilst the mother accepts that she had a difficult and dysfunctional childhood, exhibiting disruptive behaviour from an early age, she denied that she was accommodated due to her behaviour or that she was a risk to her siblings citing her mother's disapproval of her then boyfriend.  The Local Authority does not deny that there was disapproval of the boyfriend, the father of C and A, but points to the fact that the mother was, in fact, placed in care at the age of 15 and, thus, there is a well documented history that points to circumstances of considerably greater concern than an unsuitable boyfriend.  That is evident from the contemporaneous records, from the assessments carried out regarding A and directly in these proceedings from the Local Authority's dealings with the maternal grandmother as part of the assessment of her at the mother's request.  I have already quoted from part of that.  Running through the dealings with MGM in her report, it is the mother's problematic behaviour, the consequential arguments and the risk to children in the grandmother's care.  Her step-father said that he had greater clout so far as the mother was concerned but even he, on his account, could not always manage her and had had to ask her to leave the house.  

 

Further evidence for that, it seems to the court, is the self evidently poor relationship that exists.  Despite the mother's complaints about her inability to visit her mother when at Elizabeth House, conspicuously absent is any evidence of the grandmother visiting the mother.  Indeed, she told the social worker that she only went to the hospital to see B once because she was fearful of forming an attachment with that child.  It is not lost on the court that, entirely in keeping with this avoidance of her daughter, MGM has not attended, still less given evidence of the support that she might offer her daughter.  It seems to the court that in latching on to the boyfriend, of whom I am sure they did disapprove, the mother fails to face up to the more serious disruption that she caused resulting in her being put into care at what was a comparatively old age.

 

The second, third and fourth features of the threshold really can fall to be considered together.  The mother accepts the psychological disorders but denies the effect that they have on her ability to care for A, in particular, or children in general.  In fact, as I have said, in evidence the mother did accept that after A's removal there was a realisation that she was not able to care for him and so I think that the second ground is proved on her own account quite apart from on the evidence of Dr�Tyrie that her presentation was such that she could not care for A in an appropriate manner with a consistent or safe, physically and emotionally warm environment.  Dr�Tyrie confirmed that and pointed to the characteristic classical features of her diagnosis, impulsive, irresponsible, aggressive outbursts and so on.  

 

More contentious, therefore, is the present situation.  There are examples before, during and after the mother's time with B in Elizabeth House.  There is, it seems to the court, a crescendo of such matters with the passage of time.  Thus, as is clear from the parenting assessment, the mother was much more stable, much more receptive to help and less prone to outbursts but there were warning signs in Praxis from January onwards.  There was an incident in early April following the mother projectile vomiting and leaving the mess, becoming argumentative when challenged, the failure to clean up being explained by her waiting until she was better without any insight as to how others living there might have felt about what she had done.  There was a challenging outburst at the pre-discharge meeting, denying that she needed the support previously agreed and overreaction to the advice that she felt that she did not need or disagreed with almost as soon as she arrived at Elizabeth House.  The support was extensive, of course, but the court finds that it was commensurate with the concerns.  Therefore, there was 24 hour staffed accommodation, the community foster carer and so on.  

 

It is, I accept from Dr�Tyrie, part of the characteristic of the mother's personality that she is likely to behave as she did and it is to her credit that she was able to go on and engage and benefit from that support but she did not do so consistently and whilst I note Miss�Adcock's criticism that the chronology and, therefore, Dr�Tyrie's report may appear to focus on the negatives as opposed to the positives, it is the persistence of negatives that undermines the positives because the latter, the positives, are not consistent.  Nor is it an answer, as the mother said, to suggest that the bad behaviour in Elizabeth House was attributed to being there.  I accept that being in such an environment is intrusive and is restricting, claustrophobic even, as the mother said.  I am sure that there are many tensions with other young mothers who themselves have a multitude of problems: that is why they are there but if the greater goal cannot be seen in such a way as to enable the mother to grin and bear it for what is a relatively limited period of time, it is scarcely encouraging but the behaviour, as I say, was evident before she went there.  

 

A reading of the records show that it persisted to a greater or lesser extent not all the time, of course, whilst she was there and the instability and chaos in her life has been evident since, most recently over her living arrangements.  Abandoning her tenancy to return to Praxis for what seems like a potentially good reason but then leaving days later in circumstances that recent information of the Local Authority would suggest are open to dispute, is not encouraging either and of the incidents in Elizabeth House relied on by the Local Authority, the mother simply denied them all.  Rocking B violently in her arms when agitated, witnessed, she told me, by the social worker, was denied.  Narrowly missing banging B's head when storming out of a room during an argument, picking B up in the baby bouncer and going off to her room, hysterical screaming and crying in the course of an altercation are all examples of extreme reactions to what are, at the end of the day, everyday trials and tribulations culminating in what seems to have been a fairly major episode on 6th June with another resident when the mother, I accept, was responsible for calling the police.  She may well have been provoked, as she said she was, but her reaction was disproportionate, it was completely ungoverned and she was very slow indeed to respond to the efforts of both the staff and the police to calm her down.  

 

That, in turn, feeds into the fifth finding I am asked to make because, on her own account, the mother's outbursts have, on a handful of occasions, occurred in B's presence and she has been exposed to them.  There is quite a lot of evidence of that: shouting and screaming on it being pointed out that she was rocking the pram with B in it too intensely and then in temper threatening to kill herself, refusing to hand B over to staff when reacting badly to a formal warning, swearing at the foster carer when asked to get out of bed and questioned as to why she had left soiled clothing lying on the landing.  It is also clear that the mother was evicted from Elizabeth House, and she accepted that description of it, was due to her behaviour, although she argued that it was due to an allegation of drink and drugs which she denied.  

 

The records show the progression of problems, the warnings, the request by the Local Authority to accommodate B after the incident on 6th June and it is clear from the Elizabeth House documentation and the evidence of the social worker that it was the increasing concern for the safety of others due to her behaviour that caused the eviction, even if the last incident was, in fact, triggered by the allegation of drink or drugs.  Likewise her evidence as to the circumstances in which she came to leave St Helena's hostel in 2011 and Praxis in 2013, (ignoring what I was told but which was not proved in 2014), has to be contrasted with the records that show a recurring pattern, all of which is entirely in keeping with the behaviour to be expected given the diagnosis.

 

It was striking that the mother in many, if not most, of the incidents in dispute either disputed their occurrence or claimed not to remember.  The distinction she drew between becoming annoyed and losing her temper is another one that I struggled to recognise.  It seemed to the court that it was all consistent with Dr�Tyrie's evidence that the mother's perception of events is wholly different to those around her.  I do not think for a moment that she was seeking to mislead the court deliberately.  She simply cannot identify herself with behaviour that most people would regard as unacceptable.  Even she can see that it is not, when it is explained in the cold light of day, because her perception unfortunately at the time is quite different.  Despite what she says, I do not think that she remembers, or certainly not realises, just how unacceptable her behaviour is at times.  

 

It is, I repeat, very sad but I remind myself that Elizabeth House is run by a charity, not the Local Authority, a charity that features in cases from time to time, run by people who are dedicated to the rehabilitation of young mothers with problems not of their own making and who have no other agenda.  Their approach is, in my experience, very even-handed.  The reports which I have read in full contain the good, the bad and the ugly and there is a lot I accept that is good and that is greatly to the mother's credit and encouraging but, as Dr�Tyrie has identified, improvement does come with maturation and the mother demonstrates some signs of this but the concerning behaviour is still at a level that does, indeed, point to a difficulty in there being any confidence in her ability to provide consistent, secure and safe parenting.

 

Finally, the mother's ability to meet B's and her own basic needs is apparent throughout the history.  It was apparent with A but, more importantly, it has persisted in less acute form with B throughout the Elizabeth House stay.  I accept this is not wilful or malicious behaviour on her part, I accept it is not as bad as it had been, I accept that she has tried her hardest and to an extent achieved but it was not enough and I am satisfied that B's needs were not met, she was not kept in a clean and hygienic environment.  There is no medical evidence to link it with B's persistent medical problems but it is a worrying fact that these occurred.  B was on several occasions, in what was a controlled and safe environment, exposed to shocking outbursts of real anger that were really harmful to her.  She was unable sufficiently to regulate her behaviour through no fault of her own, even to get successfully through a highly supported, tailor-made programme designed to ensure the best chance of keeping B with her.

 

Where her evidence conflicts with that of the social worker, with the guardian, with Dr�Tyrie, I prefer theirs rather than hers.  That is not, I stress, because of her seeking to mislead me.  I think she genuinely believes that her perception is the correct one.  It is from her point of view, as Dr�Tyrie explained, but objectively it is not and, accordingly, I am satisfied that the threshold has been made out.  I therefore have to accept that it is necessary for the court to make an order to safeguard B's welfare, so the next issue is what the correct order should be.

 

The Court of Appeal, following the Supreme Court in Re B[4] earlier last year, has had a great deal to say about this in a series of important cases.  The evidence in this case was finalised at or about the time these decisions were being made and it is, therefore, understandable that the evidence is not in a format that does not take these cases into account.  Furthermore, despite the case being listed in December before Mr�Justice Cobb, the opportunity to fill the gap thereby created was lost.  I raised this with counsel at the outset but no one, and certainly not Miss�Adcock, invited me to adjourn for more evidence, nor did she complain at the social worker and guardian expanding their evidence.  In another case that might have prejudiced a parent.  Miss�Adcock conceded that it did not in this case because the options, all agree, are stark ones arising from these undisputed facts.  The only family carer available for B is her mother.  Her father may not have been identified but if he has, he does not want, I am satisfied, a role of any sort.  Having identified M's mother and step-father, they were assessed negatively and neither the mother nor they have sought to challenge that, the grandparents not seeking to play any part in this case beyond that assessment.

 

B is now a month short of her first birthday.  She has spent a little over half of her life in foster care.  Her primary attachment is to her foster carer.  For reasons good or bad, the mother has not committed to contact, having seen her just twice in the last six weeks at which, it has to be said, very good and appropriate contact has been observed.  If the mother cannot care for B now, or in a time scale that meets B's needs, the professional advice is that adoption is the only realistic option notwithstanding the extreme nature of such an order and, therefore, I need to consider the evidence as to the realistic prospects that the mother has of caring for B.  She does not say that it should be today or next week, recognising that a programme would have in stages to be implemented which is an appropriately insightful view.  

 

The Local Authority says, however, that there is no resource it can offer that would safeguard B in the mother's care.  As the social worker put it to me, if the placement with the mother could not be maintained in Elizabeth House, it could not be maintained anywhere else.  Apart from the 24 hour staffing, I have listed previously the additional support.  The community foster carer, in particular, was a very considerable facility, quite apart from the other help I have mentioned.  In support of that position was Dr�Tyrie describing the need for 24 hour care seven days a week.  The very experienced guardian said that Elizabeth House and the community foster carer were quite the best support that could be offered or provided.  From experience, and acutely conscious of the need for the court to scrutinise and probe the Local Authority, I cannot recall a more intensive level of support than was here offered.  

 

In pointing to her isolation in Elizabeth House, separation from her friends and family, geographical separation from Newcastle and her family, the mother invites me to consider other alternatives.  In July she favoured the Praxis mother and baby facility at Gloucester Way.  Part of the attraction was her knowledge of the staff there who are Praxis staff and other mothers who had spent their pregnancies in Praxis with her.  She also offered to go into a local authority mother and baby foster placement which she thought would be better for her than Elizabeth House.  The social worker told me that Gloucester Way would not be suitable.  There are no support staff on site after five or at weekends.  Help is at the end of a telephone only.  Given the concerns that the staff at Elizabeth House had, that would be insufficient to safeguard or protect B.  Much of what comes from Praxis to professionals is through self report.  The reports of the staff at Elizabeth House show just how unreliable mother's own self reporting is.  

 

It had been hoped, the social worker told me, that the mother would have been able to move on from Elizabeth House to Ridley Villas which is effectively into a supported flat.  That is not staffed overnight either but that plan could not progress, quite apart from the breakdown that occurred at Elizabeth House, because the staff at Ridley Villas recognised that it could not provide the mother with the level of care that was needed.  The social worker said if the mother could not look after her single room properly in Elizabeth House, she could not possibly look after a flat with a baby.  Given the failure at Elizabeth House as well as B's age and the mother's nomadic existence and lack of commitment to contact, she said it was not possible to justify a further trial of placement without far better odds on it succeeding.  A return to Elizabeth House would not have any increased prospect of success and the effect on B of breaking the attachment with her foster carer would be devastating if such a further assessment failed, hence her inability to recommend it.  Her evidence was supported by Dr�Tyrie and by the guardian who felt that there was no or insufficient evidence that lasting improvements were being made.  She said that all manner of residential settings were discussed and considered at the outset of the proceedings, by which time Elizabeth House had, of course, broken down and none could be found that provided sufficient supervision or monitoring as well as meeting B's best interests.

 

Miss�Adcock reminded me of the process that I have to consider in determining which order best meets B's needs and I do, of course, have regard to the considerable jurisprudence on this subject beginning with the judgment of the Supreme Court in Re B and the more recent decision of the Court of Appeal in B-S[5] and in Re W (A Child)[6], the President saying that the principles from those latter two cases must now inform practice in all care cases, B-S directing the court's approach to the question of making care and placement orders and to the issue of proportionality, Re W elucidating what is required from the Local Authority when the care plan is as here for adoption.  

 

The judgment of the President of the Supreme Court in Re B, Lord Neuberger, is particularly relevant.  The context there was a child that the local authority sought to place for adoption.  The statutory threshold was said to be satisfied on a relatively modest factual basis but the final orders sought were at the highest level of interference with Article 8 rights to family life, the extreme end of state intervention, namely the permanent removal of a child and placement for adoption against the will of the parent.  Lord Neuberger said that the welfare of the child had to be the paramount consideration throughout and that involved taking into account the factors set out in what is known as the welfare checklist as well as the range of powers available to the court had to be construed along with the range of powers to be considered under the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  Bearing in mind the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child he said this:

 

"A care order in a case such as this is a very extreme thing, a last resort as it would be very likely to result in a child being adopted against the wishes of both her parents.    

As already mentioned, it is clear that a judge cannot properly decide that a care order should be made in such circumstances, unless the order is proportionate bearing in mind the requirements of Article 8. 

It appears to me that, given that the judge concluded that the section 31(2) threshold was crossed, he should only have made a care order if he had been satisfied that it was necessary to do so in order to protect the interests of the child.  By 'necessary', I mean, to use Lady Hale's phrase, 'where nothing else will do.'"  

He went on to state that the conclusion was clear not only under the Act but put beyond doubt by Article 8 of the Convention which raises a presumption that a child's best interests are served by being with their parents wherever possible and that adoption can only occur if a child separated from his or her parents against their will when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that separation is necessary for the best interests of the child.

There is no doubt that the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal have been at pains to stress how high the bar is before such far reaching orders are made.  In B-S the President reminded courts faced with making such decisions that: first, it is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing, an endorsement of the observations of the European Court in YC v United Kingdom[7] that harked back to what Lord Templeman and Mr�Justice Hedley had said in cases long ago and what Miss�Adcock described to me as a gold standard of parenting.  That is not what is required.

 

 Second, that Re B used striking language as to the degree of necessity before making such orders was endorsed. 

 

Third, the need to explore and attempt alternative solutions was emphasised.

 

Fourth, Lord Neuberger's reminder that the court's assessment of the parent's ability to discharge responsibilities towards the child must take into account the assistance and support which authorities offer. 

 

Fifth, the need for proper evidence both from the Local Authority and the guardian addressing all the options which are realistically possible, containing an analysis of the arguments for and against each.

 

Sixth, the global holistic evaluation endorsed by Lord Justice McFarlane in Re G [8]and absent such evidence, setting a timetable that did not run the risk of justice being denied.

 

So if the threshold is established, the court is involved in evaluating the arrangements that best meet the child's needs by reference to the paramount consideration of the child's welfare, the welfare evaluation discussed by Lord Justice McFarlane in Re G. Where the court has before it the option of adoption it has to take place, that evaluation, in the context of the welfare provisions in the 2002 Act identifying the paramount consideration as the child's welfare throughout the lifetime and he went on to describe and I do not think it is necessary for me to repeat here the balancing exercise, weighing up each option with its own internal positives and negatives, compare them side by side in a holistic way.  

 

In Re W the court said that the approach to exercising its jurisdiction involved making the following judgments: 

 

first, what is the timetable within which the child's welfare is to be determined? 

second, what are the key issues that need to be determined for the ultimate decision to be made?

third, whether there are jurisdictional facts which, if found, are sufficient to satisfy the threshold? 

fourth, what are the key findings of fact in respect of the key issues identified?  

The response to those questions must then inform the answers to three questions identified by Lady Hale in the matter of In the matter of J (Children)[9] namely: 

first, what is the harm and/or likelihood of harm? 

second, to what is the harm or likelihood attributable? and 

third, what would be best for the child?  

The court is then to conduct an evaluation of the placement options considering what services are available identifying: first, the welfare analysis of the available placement options; second, the best option among those available on a welfare evaluation and what orders are proportionate and necessary.  

Miss�Adcock reminded me of much of this, of the stringent standard to be met, of the need to take the least interventionist course and to consider the issue of assistance central to this case with a mother who acknowledges the need for it.  

Addressing the questions identified, this is a child who is almost a year old and in terms of a timetable there is now a pressing need to have her future determined.  If it can be determined by a return to her mother within a reasonably measurable time, delay would not be fatal but an open-ended wait is, however, inimical to her emotional well-being.  The key issue is whether there is a prospect, by which I mean a realistic one, of B being cared for by her mother within a commensurate timetable.  The jurisdictional facts found do satisfy the threshold under section 31.  The mother relies heavily on the fact that she has matured, is in a far better place than she was when A was born, has undertaken bereavement counselling, has sought anger management and, indeed, sought and had an initial assessment for some form of therapy, promising signs that she says can be built upon.  

 

However, against that, Dr�Tyrie advises that the therapy, if it was of the right sort, would be very long and would have no guarantee of success.  It would be generally offered under the National Health Service for two years but she questioned if that would be enough given the depth of the problems.  The problem facing this court is that the mother has had an initial assessment but has not yet been accepted, still less has she started work, still less is her commitment to it or completing known.  She had, of course, demonstrated a commendable commitment by seeking it in the first place and undertaking the bereavement counselling which was, however, a relatively short course but this therapy would be challenging and we have good examples of how she reacts to challenging help from what happened in Elizabeth House.  Dr�Tyrie also makes the point that many who embark upon this course do not complete it.

 

Notwithstanding the mother's good intentions, it seems to the court that the prospect is a completely open-ended one.  If she had been accepted and had started and there was some understanding of time scales and progress being made, that could all be weighed up against B's time scales and the advantage of being brought up by her mother against the delay in being finally settled with her.  There is before the court no such evidence.  Sadly, the evidence points to no more than a preliminary step taken with no time scales, no forecast of success.  Really the court is left with Dr�Tyrie's rather pessimistic view and, in my judgment, whilst the progress the mother has made is real and not illusory, it is still far from what would be required for the court to have sufficient confidence that it was likely to succeed.

 

Accordingly, addressing the likelihood of harm, it is plainly emotionally harmful for B to be exposed to the mother's erratic, inconsistent and unreliable behaviour as well as her inconsistent availability for B, as Dr�Tyrie stressed, together with the inadvertent exposure that would arise thereby to physical harm through neglect through a lack of awareness of her more extreme behaviour.  I do stress that it would be inadvertent because I accept her evidence, and that of Dr�Tyrie, that she would never intentionally harm B: nothing could be further from the truth.  All of that is attributable, I am satisfied, to the mother's mental health, itself a dreadful consequence of her own parenting and her upbringing, a tragic misfortune which is not of her making and for which she bears no responsibility.

 

So what will be best for B?  Even taking a holistic view, as urged by Lord Justice McFarlane, there are only two realistic alternatives as the guardian and the social worker state.  It either has to be rehabilitation or permanence outside her family.  One simply cannot commit a child not yet 1 to a lifetime of statutory care for all the reasons articulated by Lady Justice Black in Re V quite apart from the lack of stability which is inherent in long term fostering: the risk of disruption through changes in circumstances of the foster carer, the risk of applications, the child's resistance to foster care as she grows older and becomes more aware of her circumstances and the intrusive nature of having a statutory parent are all reasons why it could not be justified for a child of B's age.  Foster care could only be justified as a short term measure if the prospect of rehabilitation were good enough to justify it.  For all the reasons that I have advanced or discussed, they are not and nor is there a level of practical assistance and support that would ensure B's safety.  Indeed, the level of support required would run the risk of those providing support being at times the primary carers.

 

B needs and deserves now a forever family who can claim her and give her the stability she needs throughout her minority.  That can, I am satisfied, only be achieved by adoption, notwithstanding the very high price a permanent separation from her mother and half brother.  Considering the position of B life long it is the best option, it is the only option because, sadly, nothing else will do.  My paramount consideration has to be her welfare life long.  She is too young to have wishes and feelings.  She is a young, vulnerable child totally dependant upon her primary carer and that is now her foster carer.  Whether the mother's reasons are good or bad, it is the fact that she has struggled to maintain that attachment through contact.  

 

In due course B will learn that she will have ceased to be a member of her birth family.  That will, no doubt, have a profound effect upon her but with sensitive life story work and adequate preparation I am satisfied that that very significant loss is one that is not just manageable but is justified to ensure that all her other needs are met given the alternative which, as I have found, has exposed her to some harm already and would undoubtedly expose her to the risk of suffering more harm.  

 

Accordingly, the proportionate and necessary orders are both a care order and a placement order.  I am not able to make the latter without the mother's consent but for the reasons I have given I am satisfied I should dispense with that consent using the power in section 52 of the 2002 Act because B's welfare demands that I do so.  In reaching this conclusion I have paid full regard to the Article 8 rights of both B and her mother as well as the welfare checklist.  It is, of course, I repeat, very sad and there is little consolation that one can offer a mother in such circumstances.  All that can be offered is this: that by giving B this chance to be brought up in an emotionally stable and secure environment she will have the best prospect, the best chance available to her, of achieving her potential, whatever that may be and if she is able to do so in that emotionally secure way that I have described and avoid the serious difficulties that her mother has had inflicted upon her by reason of her own upbringing, I hope that that will be some consolation for her, albeit I accept not for a long time to come.

 

Finally, I am satisfied on the evidence that F1 is not B's father.  The birth certificate is wrong and I make a declaration to that effect.  I grant the Local Authority permission to change B's surname to X, that is to say the name of her mother.  That is also a decision affecting B's welfare so the welfare checklist in the 1989 Act applies but it seems unarguable that it is in B's interests to be known by the name of a man who not only has no biological link but has no emotional link with her either.  

 

I will direct that a transcript of this judgment be prepared, the cost to be borne equally by all three parties to the case.  There will be the usual order for the public funding assessment of the respondent's costs and I will invite Miss Sehat to draw an order and submit it to me in the usual way.

This case concerns one child, a boy named A who is now 12 years of age.  The Applicant local authority is the London Borough of Sutton represented by Ms Chatterjee.  The first Respondent is Ms D is A's mother and she is represented by Mr Fitzpatrick.  The second Respondent is Mr B, he is A's father and he is represented by Ms Shrimpton.  Finally A through his guardian Julia Hughes is represented by Mrs Jones-King.  I should state straightaway that I am very grateful to all the professionals involved in this case for their very considerable assistance to the court.

 
  The application before the court is the local authority's application for a care order in respect of A and the application was issued on 11th July 2012.  The final hearing was listed to take place in the week of 2nd December 2013.  In the event the hearing started during that week but could not conclude due to the illness of one of the witnesses, Dr Pettle.  Most unfortunately I had to adjourn the hearing part-heard so that Mr Fitzpatrick had the opportunity to cross-examine Dr Pettle.

 
  For the purposes of the hearing I have had the assistance of four lever arch files full of documents.  I have read all the relevant statements and reports in the bundles and have had the benefit of hearing live evidence from the child's social workers Lisa Hammerton and Andrew Rowat and a social worker involved in family finding called Jennifer Walker.  I have also heard from Sarah Thomas who was one of the joint authors of the two Umbrella reports, from Dr. Pettle, Ms D and the Guardian.

 
  As to the issues in the case, it was conceded from the beginning that the threshold criteria under Section 31(2) of the Children Act are satisfied in this case and a short statement of final threshold has been provided which is an agreed document reflecting that fact.  The issues therefore revolve around what orders if any are in A's best interests.  To identify those issues I need to summarise the positions of the various parties as to the orders they ask me to make.

 
  The local authority say that I should make a final care order based upon their final care plan which is a plan for A to be in long-term foster care.  Their plan also involves a significant reduction in contact between A and his family reducing to direct contact for Ms D of six times a year, three including D, direct contact for Mr B of six times a year and one additional direct contact for A with his maternal grandparents and stepfather and D.

 
  Ms D's position is put in a number of alternative ways.  Her first preference would be for the court to adjourn the case to enable her to participate in attachment work with Dr Woolgar from the South London and Maudsley Hospital (sometimes called SLAM) or alternatively with a more local team of professionals as recommended by Dr. Pettle, she then says there should be a further assessment by Dr Pettle with a view to A returning to her care.  She does not suggest A should return to her care straightaway.  Her second choice would be for the court to invite the local authority to amend its care plan to include provision for the attachment work described.  In any event she seeks more contact and if the local authority's plan for long-term foster care is approved she argues for direct contact once every three weeks with additional contacts during holidays.

 
  Mr B's position is that he does not oppose the local authority's care plan for long-term foster care but seeks more contact than they are offering and suggests contact once a month including occasional overnight stays.  He would also like telephone contact once a week.

 
  The guardian supports the local authority's plan for long-term foster care but does not support their plan for contact.  She says that A should have contact with his mother and his father once a month each but that these contacts should take place at the same weekend on a Saturday and a Sunday so that there is only one weekend a month with contact taking place.  In her position statement she suggested that a court order for contact might be needed because of concerns that the local authority wish to reduce contact.

 
  I turn to the background to the case.  Mr M, who has sometimes been referred to as A's stepfather is 44.  Ms D is 40.  Mr B is now 40.  A is 12.  Within months of his birth the relationship between Ms D and Mr B had broken down and Mr B had departed.  Thereafter Ms D commenced a relationship with Mr M which lasted for a considerable time.  Unfortunately there were problems with A and on occasions he was beyond the control of Ms D.

 
  In 2009 A was in Section 20 accommodation for seven to eight months.  On 1st July 2010 D was born so he is now 3.  Ms D is D's mother and Mr M is D's father. D lives with his mother.  Problems with A continued and on 9th July 2012 A assaulted his mother and was made subject to a police protection order.  On 11th July 2012 the local authority's application in these proceedings was made and shortly afterwards an interim care order was made and thereafter renewed.  The matter proceeded in the Family Proceedings Court until 15th July 2013 when it was transferred to the County Court.  As to where A has been living, he has been in foster care since 9th July 2012.  He was in a number of different placements until 18th November 2012 when he was placed with Mr and Mrs O where he has remained to date.  He has contact with his father every Sunday and with his mother once a week during term time and twice a week during the holidays.  Once every eight weeks he sees his maternal grandparents and stepfather.

 
As to the adults in the case, Ms D is 40.  She has one brother called M.  According to Ms D her own father had an alcohol problem, was verbally and physically abusive to her and was violent to her mother.  He did nothing for her confidence telling her that no-one would ever love her.  Ms D is described as having had a very troubled adolescence E294 and she does not get on with M E29.  She has not seen her father for quite a number of years and has significant differences of opinion with her mother.  In the past she has had problems with alcohol and drugs but not for some years now.  She has had mental health problems and has had a diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder.

 
Mr B is 40 and has one older sister.  It appears that he may have been deprived of oxygen at birth and was at a special school for children with learning difficulties.  He has worked in a psychiatric hospital in the past including as an assistant nurse but currently works as a machine operator.  He is described as laid back and easygoing although the documents suggest that at times he gets panicked or has flashbacks E243.

 
As to Mr M, he is 44 and was in a relationship with Ms D for a considerable period of time.  It appears that that relationship ended at about the end of 2011 or early 2012.  There were allegations of domestic violence during that relationship and it appears a non-molestation order was obtained in 2008 E118.

 
As to A, he is 12 and, although there has been some disagreement about the accurate diagnosis, it is clear that he is a boy with complex developmental learning and behavioural needs.  He has a statement of special educational needs and is at a special school for children with a learning disability.  In the past he has had a diagnosis of ADHD and ASD although there is a dispute whether he has now outgrown ADHD and whether or not he has autism.  He is described as kind and compassionate E261 although possibly vulnerable socially E63.  He is very impulsive and easily distracted.  He can be aggressive and challenging and has for example assaulted his mother and bit her, smashed furniture at home and flooded sinks and baths in the house.  His behaviour is said to be much better in a calm and structured environment with clear boundaries.  He has settled well with his current foster carers and is making good progress there.  Unfortunately it appears that he feels responsible for his mother and tends to blame himself for being in care F545.

 
I have briefly mentioned the threshold document which records that at the relevant date in July 2012 A was likely to suffer significant harm by being beyond parental control.

 
I have had the assistance of a number of expert reports and assessments.  Dr Aziz is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and on 30th December 2009 she said "the diagnoses of ADHD and autistic spectrum disorder are not in question .. his disruptive behaviour seems to be much more obvious when he is with his mother �" E137.

 
  Dr Khor is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and on 1st October 2012 at E10(d) says,"I have not noted anything that would suggest an autistic spectrum diagnosis for A".  Dr Berg is also a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and has provided a report at E11 dated 8th October 2012.  She refers to A's diagnosis of ADHD and ASD but says at E21,

 
"It is my opinion that A has outgrown his ADHD, I am also of the opinion that A does not have autism, A has learning difficulties and has needed ongoing support from school."  She also says he seems to benefit from clear, consistent and containing parenting E22.  His hyperactive and agitated behaviour is based on emotional stress in the context of learning disability and previous adverse experiences in his family E25."
	Linda Everard is a speech and language therapist and has provided a report dated 16th November 2012 at E133.  She describes A as very impulsive and easily distracted E134 and having language difficulties with his "profile of language" falling below average, being moderate to severe in nature E135.  She says he continues to need specialist support.

 
	  Dr Gemma Wilson is a psychologist and provides a report dated 22nd February 2013 at E140.  She says at E168 he has complex developmental behavioural emotional and therefore learning needs, he scores above the cut-off for an autism diagnosis E201 but it is impossible to give an autism diagnosis with any degree of certainty at this time E202, he has definite difficulties communicating and interacting with others and shows rigidity in his thinking and behaviour.  He might benefit from some therapeutic work E203.  Children with difficulties such as A's respond to clear, calm and consistent parenting and boundaries.  Good enough parenting is often not enough for children with complex developmental needs E213.

 
	  Dr Sharon Pettle is a psychologist and she provided a report dated 19th May 2013 at E286.  In her report she says she saw Ms D who had said she felt numb when A was challenging and aggressive E292 and was herself provocative and antagonistic especially when she was nervous or uncomfortable E293.  She was overwhelmed by A's behavioural difficulties, E299, finding D quite different from A E298.  A's behaviour was far worse with her than with others and Dr.Pettle considered there was "a poor fit" between mother and son so that it was very unlikely A would have been able to form a secure attachment to his mother E312.  Dr. Pettle noted that "the extreme aggressive and destructive outbursts" that A had while in his mother's care have not emerged while he is elsewhere and she concluded that his problems and their severity are likely to have been compounded by emotional aspects of his relationship with his mother E319.  In her view a significant part of A's difficulties relate to the relationship with his mother but this does not wholly explain them E316.  In his current placement he has been able to enjoy praise, has a strong sense of boundaries and predictability and has been able to function more appropriately and take developmental strides forwards.  She says in her view it is likely if he returned to his mother's care these gains would be lost and his behaviour would deteriorate once again E317.  Finally she says that despite the difficulties A's relationship with his mother is important and in time it would be beneficial if contact could be longer. E317.

 
	 Dr. Pettle gave evidence at the adjourned hearing in February 2014.  She had seen updating documents but had not seen A or Ms D since her report.  Her oral evidence was very different from the evidence in her report.  Orally she recommended;

 
a.	Adjourning the final hearing for a period of approximately six months.
b.	Arranging an urgent meeting of professionals.
c.	Ms. D should be "helped or advocated" towards psychotherapy, of probably 4-6 months.
d.	There should be psychological intervention for A.
e.	"Proper narrative therapeutic work" for A and his family.
f.	There should then be an updated assessment of A.

She said all the work required should be linked together and not "a jigsaw of therapy", and added that she "did not think it impossible" to do this in a coordinated way.  She did not support A's return home at present.
In relation to Ms D, Dr Dove, psychiatrist, provided a report dated 18th October 2012 at E26 and an addendum dated 27th November 2013 at E324.  Dr Dove describes a long history of self-harming E30, depression and low self-esteem E39 and agrees the diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder E40, she says Ms D could benefit from further therapy which would be quite demanding and take a number of months E41.  In her addendum she says that Ms D has made progress in recent years E328 but the diagnosis is valid although it is possible there are no longer marked symptoms evident E327.

 
The Umbrella Service provided a long assessment in relation to Ms D dated 21st November 2012 at E44, this says that Ms D does not provide A with clear boundaries E71 with Ms D treating A more as a friend, it concludes that Ms D has been unable to manage A's behaviour for a number of years E110 although his behaviour is manageable in a calm and structured context where there are clear routines and boundaries E112.  When they are together A presented as the one who was more in charge and shows agitation and challenging behaviour when with his mother which is not present when he is with others E115.  It concludes that it is unlikely Ms D will be able to provide the parenting that A requires on her own and this is even more unlikely whilst she is caring for D as well E122; they express the opinion that Ms D would be unable to meet A's needs within his timescales even with further support E123 and recommend a long-term foster placement for A E125.  In oral evidence ST said that A needed a secure base and was unable to believe in his mother as an authority figure.

 
The Umbrella Service also provided a long and detailed report in relation to Mr B dated 11th March 2013 at E215, this records that A appears to like boundaries and routines E255 and wants the uncertainty to end E259, the foster carers describe him as a rewarding but demanding child to care for E266.  Despite reflecting many positives in Mr B's relationship with A, they conclude that placing A with him would run the risk of his paramount need for stability being jeopardised E266.

 
As to other evidence the social worker Lisa Hammerton said in relation to A there had been a very significant improvement in his presentation since he had been in foster care; he is not bedwetting, he is sleeping through the night, he is doing better at school, attending regularly, being able to express his feelings and has not destroyed property or hurt anybody since he was removed from his mothers care.  As to A's wishes they seem somewhat confused.  He had said he wished to go back to his first foster carer but his main thought is to return to his mother's care.  He wants a decision to be made.  Last time that she spoke to him he asked the social worker if the foster carers could care for him because he said he could not live with his father because the accommodation was unsuitable and he could not live with his mother because he might kick-off.

 
  As to Ms D the social workers accepted that it was positive that she was not misusing substances but LH's understanding was that this had been the case for quite a number of years and that it was unfortunate that Ms D had not attended LAC reviews or planning meetings with the local authority.  LH explained that she had a difficult relationship with Ms D and experienced her as hostile at times.  The social worker said that contact between Ms D and A had initially been very difficult but had improved.  The last time that A kicked off and had to be restrained was on 27th December 2012.  Contact with mother was much more boundaried than it was and A enjoyed seeing D.

 
  As to Mr B the social worker had a good working relationship with him and said that contact was good, the only difficulty being that Mr B was sometimes unreliable in attending, he showed a lot of warmth.  As to the local authority plans, the social worker accepted that she had in her own mind effectively ruled out Ms D as a potential carer for A by March 2013 although she said the local authority did reconsider matters at review meetings.  She said that the planned reduction in contact for A would be likely to be very difficult for him.  When contact once a month was suggested she said it sounded like a good idea but it might be hard for A trying to form new roots and new connections.

 
Jennifer Walker, the family finding social worker, provided an initial statement saying that ideally A should be the only child in the placement C382 and that currently the Local Authority do not have any in-house approved long-term foster carers C383.  She had contacted four fostering agencies to see if there was any point processing referrals and they all gave a positive indication in response, she said she thought there would be a small pool of approved carers to meet A's specific needs and that matching will be difficult with contact being a relevant issue.  A high level of contact makes it more difficult to match children.  It was put to her that contact with his family was beneficial to A and her response was that from her perspective contact was one aspect of A's needs but she had to take into account all his needs, she said that her experience told her that to have contact seven times a years in this situation was excessive and it was going to be difficult to match A.  She added that having an order for contact would have an additional significant impact on the prospects of achieving a placement for A.  In her more recent statement she explained that further enquiries had found a potential matching family for A with experienced carers who are open to work with continuing contact between A and his family.

 
In her evidence Ms. D said she is not working at present, she moved house at the end of 2012 and now lives in a quiet three bedroomed semi with helpful neighbours.  She feels calmer and contact has improved.  She said she felt very defensive when being assessed by Umbrella and that was a problematic time for her.  She said she found Dr. Hanson really hostile and standoffish and her impression was that Dr. Hanson was not willing to work with her.  She said that A has his problems but there are many wonderful things about him and he is growing up.  She did not ask for A to return to her care now but "broadly accepted" Dr. Pettle's recommendations.

 
The Guardian agreed that the relationship between A and his mother had improved but added that in her view there was a big risk that it might revert back to how it was.  She disagreed with Dr. Pettle's oral opinion saying that there was no sufficient justification for such a change and that the further delay was not justified nor in A's best interests.  She therefore stood by her own recommendation for a final care order approving the Local Authority care plan for long term foster care but with additional contact as set out in her report.

 
I make the following comments with regard to the live evidence I have heard from the experts in this case. I consider that the social workers were honest and were, as so often, simply doing their best given the limited resources at their disposal.   I found the evidence given by Sarah Thomas and the Guardian to be balanced, fair and thoughtful.  Although I appreciate that Dr. Pettle did not have a great deal of time to consider the updating documents provided to her, I consider that her oral evidence was not well thought out and no sufficient or adequate reasons were given for the very significant differences between her oral evidence and the evidence in her written report.

 
 When deciding what order to make clearly I must and do bear in mind Section 1 of the Children Act with the welfare of A being my paramount consideration.  I must also bear in mind the welfare checklist set out in Section 1 sub-Section (3) of the Act.

 
  Sub-Section (a) refers to the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned considered in the light of his age and understanding.  As to A's wishes it seems clear to me on the evidence that he wishes the uncertainty to end, he is somewhat confused but certainly loves his mother and would like to live with her although he has also on occasion said he would like to live with his foster carers. In a letter A wrote addressed to me A says that he would like to live with his mother but not to go straight there and also would like to see more of quite a number of friends and relatives. 

 
 Sub-Section (b) refers to the child's physical, emotional and educational needs.  Clearly A is a boy with complex developmental learning and behavioural needs as is quite apparent from all the evidence including my summary of the evidence given above.  I also bear in mind the clear evidence which I accept that A's behaviour can be highly problematic but is much more manageable in a calm and structured environment with clear boundaries.

 
  Sub-Section (c) refers to the likely effect on the child of any change in circumstances.  Unfortunately A's current carers are not able to be his long-term carers although very helpfully they have said they will continue to look after him until he is found a permanent placement, but not beyond July 2014.  Any change is likely to be difficult for him although the evidence is that if he is given a clear and calm explanation and given time to adjust he is better able to deal with changes E66, E308.

 
  Sub-Section (d) refers to the child's age, sex, background and any relevant characteristics.  I have mentioned quite a number of details about A in particular and of course in this context I very much bear in mind A's relationship with his mother, his father and with his wider family and his right to family life as well as their right to family life.

 
  Sub-Section (e) refers to any harm the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering.  I have referred already to the threshold criteria in this case and the problems that led to these proceedings being commenced and A being in foster care.

 
  Sub-Section (f) refers to how capable each of the child's parents and any other relevant person is in meeting the child's needs.  Here I must look at the various alternatives.  Mr B has, I think very realistically and responsibly, accepted that he is not in a good position to offer A long-term care and therefore does not put himself forward as a carer for A.  This leaves the alternatives of the local authority's care plan for A and the various alternatives put forward by Ms D.

 
  As to the local authority's care plan, their most recent care plan is dated 30th October 2013 and is at D31 in the bundle.  This is a plan for A to be in long-term foster care with contact subject to a phased reduction spelt out in detail on page D41 of the care plan as amended.  This now provides for reduction fairly speedily to direct contact with mother six times a year and with father six times a year and with the maternal grandparents, D and Mr M once a year.  It also provides for telephone contact for mother six times a year and father six times a year.  Support services are spelt out in the plan including the plan for continuing respite care which has to date proved important in A's life.  I am satisfied on the evidence that this is a realistic and achievable plan but the question is whether it is in A's best interests.

 
What about Ms D as potential carer for A, albeit bearing in mind she is not proposing A returns to her care immediately.  There are of course many positives in her favour.  She is A's mother and she clearly loves him and clearly wants the best for him.  She has been consistent and reliable in attending contact.  She appears to have put entirely behind her her previous difficulties with drugs and alcohol.  Contact has clearly improved and recent contact has been good and has clearly been enjoyed by A.

 
  What are the difficulties?  It is clear on the evidence that the relationship between A and his mother is a very important one to both of them but one which has been highly problematic.  There is clear evidence of A's behaviour deteriorating when in his mother's care with A behaving in an aggressive and destructive way.  There is clear evidence that Ms D has real problems providing A with consistent boundaries with their relationship being more as friends and indeed the impression being obtained that A is more in charge than Ms D.  A's progress while in foster care has been clear and obvious but there is evidence, which I accept, that it is likely that that progress would not continue but would be lost if he returned to his mother's care.  Additionally, it is unfortunate but clearly established on the evidence that Ms D has had difficulties working with professionals.  There was a potential intervention to assist Ms D with a Dr Hanson but he considered that Ms D was not really ready for this support.  Further there has been and continues to be a difficult relationship between Ms D and the social work team.

 
Bearing in mind all these different considerations the crucial question is what order is in A's best interests.  Mr Fitzpatrick has attractively argued on behalf of Ms D that matters should be adjourned for Ms D to carry out the attachment work suggested either with Dr Woolgar or as suggested by Dr. Pettle followed by a further assessment by Dr Pettle.  Of course this is a possible way forward but the difficulty is that it involves a delay of quite a number of months for A with, in my judgment, a very uncertain result.  The question is whether the prospects of success justify such delay and continuing uncertainty.  I regret to say that in my view they do not.  Taking into account all the evidence and all the points that I have mentioned and considering all the possible alternatives I have come to the clear conclusion that it is in A's best interests to make the order sought by the local authority on the basis of their plan for A to be in long-term foster care.  It is clear to me that this is in A's best interests and that this is the order that should be made.

 
The main reasons for this decision are;

 
1.	The evident difficulties in the relationship between A and his mother, both past and continuing,
2.	A's particular needs, which I find more likely to be met by the Local Authority's care plan than by any alternative,
3.	A's very good progress in foster care, 
4.	Ms D's difficulties working with professionals, and
5.	The further delay and uncertainty involved in the plan put forward by Ms. D which I consider would be unjustified and likely to be detrimental to A's welfare.
The question of contact is, however, more difficult.  On the one hand I fully accept that contact between A and his mother and father and wider family is very important to him and a very important consideration overall.  However equally if the care plan for long-term foster care is to be achievable and realistic, contact must not be set too high nor in too inflexible a way.  For this reason I do not consider that a contact order is desirable or in A's best interests.  It seems to me that the best way forward for A is to have a care plan which spells out very clearly the plans in respect of A's placement together with the plans in respect of his contact.  Such plans in respect of his contact should include, in my view, a realistic level of contact which is to be aimed at if possible but which has built-in some flexibility to reflect the point fairly made that A's needs must be assessed globally including the question of achieving a suitable placement for him.  In the result, therefore, I consider it in A's best interests to invite the local authority to amend their care plan to include the stated aim for contact to be at a level of twelve times per annum for Ms D and twelve times per annum for Mr B with a further direct visit once a year with the maternal grandparents and stepfather and D.  I think the plan should state in appropriate words that this is the intention but that it clearly needs to be kept under review in the light of how matters progress including most importantly the prospects of achieving a suitable placement for A.

 
In the event therefore I largely agree with the views expressed by the guardian although my views about contact are only different insofar as she suggests a contact order may be needed.  Provided the Local Authority agree to amend their final plan as suggested in this Judgment I do not consider an order is desirable. I should explain clearly that I prefer the evidence of the Guardian to that of Dr. Pettle, at least in her oral evidence, in particular because;

 
a.	I consider and agree with the Guardian that there is insufficient reason for the additional delay and uncertainty involved in Dr. Pettle's plan.
b.	I do not consider the prospects of a successful outcome are sufficient to justify further delay.
c.	I do not consider there was or is a sufficient reason for Dr. Pettle's substantial change of view in circumstances where she had not seen any member of the family for a long time and where her revised views were, I consider, not fully or properly thought out.
	I appreciate and have borne in mind throughout this hearing and Judgment that of course that the order that I propose to make is one which interferes very substantially with the right to family life of A and all his family especially his mother and father but I consider for the reasons given that the order I propose to make is both justified and proportionate and in pursuance of a legitimate aim namely A's welfare.

Conventions used in anonymising this judgment include:
M for mother
F for father
C for child
HHJ Murfitt: 
This case concerns C a young baby born on 4th September 2012 who is now aged 1year and 5months. Her mother is M who is aged 35 and her father is F who is aged 55. They are married and so both have parental responsibility in relation to her. Both parents were born in Pakistan and are practising Muslims. They are also cousins. F is a British Pakistani national, and having lived in Britain since he was a young man, he speaks fluent English. He is a successful businessman, and by a previous marriage he has four adult sons and two adult daughters, three of whom live in England, in the Southend and Luton area. M is a Pakistani national and she first came to this country upon her marriage to F in December 2011. She was previously married in Pakistan and sadly experienced two stillbirths before that marriage ended in divorce as a result she said, of her first husband's violence towards her.  She speaks very limited English, and she has accordingly been assisted throughout these proceedings by an interpreter. C is M's only child, and F's seventh. Both parents are practising Muslims and C is accordingly of British Pakistani Muslim heritage. F's son K shares the marital home together with his wife S and their baby Fk who is close in age to C.

 
On the day after C's birth at Southend University Hospital, the Police obtained a Police Protection Order in relation to her under 46 Children Act 1989, in circumstances which I will mention shortly. Two days later on 7th September 2013 the Southend Borough Council issued the present application, by which they seek a final care order in relation to C. An interim care order was made on 11th September 2012, and therefore for most of her life to date C has been living in foster care. 

 
The reasons for the Local Authority intervening in C's family life are set out in the threshold document dated 26th November 2013, and it is accepted by the parents that C was at risk of significant harm attributable to her parental care when protective measures were first taken in relation to her on 5th September 2013, by reason of the matters set out therein. 

 
Taking matters in chronological order, Southend Social Services first involvement with the family came following the report of an incident of Domestic Violence made by M to the Police on 11th July 2012 whilst she was pregnant with C. On that day she went to the Police Station to report that her husband had slapped her around the face, pulled her hair, and punched her in the stomach. A safe location was found for her to stay in, but she chose to return to live with her husband in August 2012, suggesting at the time that it was the first incident of violence. She has since retracted her allegations of violence altogether, and has maintained throughout these proceedings that she made the allegation up to punish her husband for his insensitivity towards her, and effectively to save her marriage. Social workers found it difficult to obtain a consistent account of the events which led her to make the report in the first place. 

 
Prior to her return home M went to stay with some relatives in London and missed two ante natal appointments at Southend University Hospital on 19th and 26th July 2012. Following her return to the family home, social workers attempts to contact her proved difficult. Meanwhile Police checks were undertaken by the Local Authority which revealed that F had been categorised as a 'high risk offender' by reason of a conviction for battery imposed on 24th March 2008 in relation to an incident between him and an ex partner, also entailing criminal damage, and breach of a non molestation order. There was also a conviction for harassment in relation to his ex-partner imposed on 12th February 2010, which led to an indefinite restraining order being made in May 2011. In the light of this discovery the Local Authority was understandably concerned that M's allegations of violence against her husband may be true, notwithstanding her retraction.

 
Soon after her birth, C was noted to have dysmorphic features including asymmetry of the mouth, an imperfectly formed right ear, an abnormal upper right eyelid, and growth inside her right nostril. The opinion of Consultant Geneticist Dr Kumar is that it is likely that C has a condition known as 'Goldenhar Syndrome', the main features of which include hemifacial microsomia. As a result of her post natal difficulties in feeding, C needed to be fed through a naso-gastric tube for a period of time after her birth. A renal scan also revealed that she has only one kidney. In addition C has congenital hypothyroidism for which she will require to take medication for the rest of her life.

 
On the 5th September M absconded from the hospital with her new born baby, and was located by Police by a phone box in Southend High Street. In her evidence she said she was frightened by something the hospital interpreter had said which led her to believe that the social services intended to take her baby away from her, and so she had taken a taxi from the hospital intending to go to her solicitors in Walthamstow. However she said when she was dropped in central Southend which she was then unfamiliar with, she did not know whether she was near her solicitors or not. After bringing her back to the hospital, the Police reported that they had to physically prevent M from leaving hospital with C on two further occasions, although she said on those occasions that she had only left the ward to fetch some tea, and next to ask the officers when her husband would be arriving since she believed they had called him. In these circumstances the Police obtained a PPO. M's actions in removing baby C from the medical supervision and care which she was receiving, clearly placed C at a serious risk of harm at that time, not least because of her baby's need for gastro-nasal feeding which had yet to be established, and which neither of the parents had been trained to undertake. In view of the number of medical conditions C was born with, there was also concern that the baby's health needs were not understood by her mother. Ironically it seems it was M's fear  and uncertainty that the Local Authority intended to remove her baby which prompted her to leave the hospital with C, whilst it was also that very action which undoubtedly prompted the Police and then the Local Authority to commence the proceedings when they did.

 
The matters which I have mentioned formed the threshold for the Local Authority intervening to protect C, and the parents conceded at an early stage that the threshold was made out in September 2013, in that C was likely to suffer harm attributable to her parents' care at the time when the Local Authority took protective steps and instituted the proceedings. The Issue now remains as to whether C continues to be likely to suffer significant harm in the future care of her mother and father if a final care order is not made, or whether C's paramount welfare demands that she is placed outside her family in the light of the considerations in s1 Children act 1989

 
It will be noted that these proceedings have been unresolved for an unusually long period of time. This is principally because by April 2013 all parties were agreed that a phased rehabilitation of C to her parents' care should be undertaken. HHJ Harris had directed a parenting assessment by independent social worker Yasmin Hossain which was completed 8.2.13. In addition a multi-disciplinary psychiatric assessment of the parents by Consultant Child Psychiatrist Dr Anjum Bashir was directed and was filed on 12.12.12.  At that time both of these professionals supported the rehabilitation of C to her parents' care, and so it was that a rehabilitation programme was duly approved to take place over a proposed 8 week period commencing from 1st April 2013. Contact between C and her parents was introduced for extended periods of time in the home on three and then four days of the week, practically supported by Punjabi/Urdu speaking family support workers. Thereafter the programme was increased to include three days from 10.30am until 4pm and two overnight contacts from 4pm until 11am each week from 3rd May 2013. Initially the plan progressed very well, and at the looked after children review on 16 May 2013 the Independent reporting officer's report noted that C "is said to have a very good routine, she is very settled with her family." The report went on to record that the allocated social worker Binesh Kappan "shared that as contact is going very well and the parents are receptive to advice given, it seems likely that C will return to the care of her parents, and he also provided a date for the planned rehabilitation for 27th June 2013, and the Local Authority will be seeking a supervision order." 

 
However in June 2013 the parents' relationship with their family support worker and social worker broke down, in circumstances which I shall refer to later in this judgment, and the rehabilitation plan was halted by the Local Authority. Although it was suggested on behalf of the Local Authority and the Guardian during the hearing that the Local Authority did not abandon the rehabilitation plan until September, I am satisfied that it was within approximately a month of the looked after child review on 16th May 2013 that the Local Authority had reached the conclusion that they would not support any continuation of the rehabilitation plan. This is apparent from the first paragraph of a position statement prepared on behalf of the Local Authority on 17th June 2013 wherein it was plainly stated that "The Local Authority no longer supports the reunification plan previously set in place for the child to be returned to the full time care of the parents in the future." 

 
Pursuant to the rehabilitation plan C had been spending time with her parents on five days of the week including two overnight occasions, however from the beginning of June the Local Authority determined that overnight contact should be withdrawn. In the 17 June position statement the Local Authority proposed that supervised weekly contact might continue on 4 weekly occasions within the family home. No amended care plan was filed, but in the light of this turn of events the parents applied to the Court for a contact order under s34(3). At the hearing listed before DJ Shanks on 9 August 2013 the Local Authority reiterated that it did not support the resumption of the rehabilitation plan and that it proposed reducing contact to twice per week pending the final hearing. Whilst criticising the Local Authority for failing to file an interim care plan or the updated report of Independent Social Worker Mrs Yasmin Hossain as had been previously directed, the Court made no other contact orders in relation to C apart from timetabling addendum reports from Mrs Hossain and Dr Bashir and giving detailed directions for the matter to be concluded in a 5 day final hearing commencing 21st October 2013. Since the autumn of last year the enduring pattern of contact between C and her family has continued to entail supervised contact of two hours twice a week supported by an interpreter at a Local Authority contact centre.  

 
Unfortunately DJ Shanks's timetable was not complied with by the Local Authority as detailed in the recitals to the orders which I made on 4th October 2013, and 11th October 2013.  Once received the addendum reports of Yasmin Hossain dated 18.8.2013 and Dr Bashir dated 27 .9.2013 expressed conflicting opinions as to whether C's needs would best be met by placement within or outside of her family, and thus it was the final hearing came to be replaced by a professionals meeting on 21st October, whilst the final hearing was re-listed for seven days between 10th and 20th December 2013. In the event I heard oral evidence from some ten witnesses (including Mrs Hossain via video link from India, and Dr Bashir who attended in person, as did three of the family support workers) over a total of 12 days concluding on 28th January 2014. This was followed by lengthy written submissions from each party which were provided in the first week of February.

 
In the care plan filed on behalf of the Local Authority dated 1.10.13 the Local Authority confirmed that it would be seeking final care and placement orders in relation to C, and in a case management order of 11.10.13 I gave directions for any application under s22(1) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to be filed and served by 22 November 2013, and for that application to be consolidated with the care proceedings subject to the provision of a report covering all matters specified under rule 29 of the Family Procedure (Adoption) Rules 2005. I directed the Guardian's appointment upon the issue of that Placement application, and in that event, gave permission for her to provide a single report dealing with both applications. Although neither the Placement application nor the Rule 29 report were filed in accordance with those directions, the Guardian Sue Johnson indicated her support for the care plan and the making of both final care and placement orders in her final analysis dated 8 December 2013. 

 
In addition to care and Placement orders the care plan dated 1.10.2013 had proposed there should be both letterbox contact and one occasion of direct contact between C and her parents each year. Having been directed to file their final evidence and care plan by 22nd November 2013 an amended plan was lodged on 26 November 2013, and this deleted the previous reference to direct contact between C and her birth family, however the plan did not include any further narrative explanation or analysis in respect of that change .

 
 Surprisingly whilst the final care plan dated 26 November 2013 referred to the fact that the case was to be presented to the adoption decision maker on 3rd December 2013, no Placement application or Rule 29/Annexe B report was in fact filed by the Local Authority either in accordance with the directions given by the Court on 11.10.2013, or thereafter during December. FPR 2010 rule 14.9 places a mandatory duty on the Local Authority to provide notice and written reasons of any request to dispense with parental consent to an adoption, and my directions provided for this to be done by 22nd November 2013. Further by paragraph 13(12) of the order the consolidation of the two applications was expressly made subject to provision of the rule 29 report. Nevertheless by the date on which the final hearing began, neither the application nor its supporting documentation had been filed or served.  Notwithstanding that the Court was advised at the outset of the hearing that the application and report would be attended to directly, during the first 7 days of the hearing between 10th and 20th December 2013, it was not. 

 
The hearing was then adjourned part-heard to January 2014 for a further three days, yet even in the intervening time the Court Office had received no documentation in relation to the proposed placement application, nor was it available by the time the hearing resumed on 14th January 2014, or over the next three days. Despite question being raised as to its absence, no explanation was offered by the Local Authority. For their part F and M firmly indicated their opposition to both such applications, and sought the return of C to their care. Ultimately it was not until 27th January 2014 that the application for a placement order in relation to C was received in the Court office and issued together with an Annexe B report dated 13 January 2014 and a statement of facts dated 18th December 2013. These items were then served on 28th January 2014 which was the twelfth and final day of the hearing, and quite some time after the parents' oral evidence had been completed. No explanation for the lateness of service was proffered either in Court or within counsel's final written submissions received on 3rd February 2014. It also follows that the Guardian's final analysis dated 8 December 2013 was completed without sight or consideration of the documents filed in support of the placement application. Even had I been able to reach the conclusion that a placement order was appropriate for C by the end of this lengthy hearing, I consider it would have been wrong to make the order in the light of the Local Authority's flagrant disregard of the rules and the Court's directions, which underpin the most basic requirements of natural justice in ensuring that parents faced with the ultimate order dispensing with their consent to the adoption of their child, receive adequate service of the documentation relating to the placement application in the proper way. It ought not to need repeating that placement orders are amongst the most draconian of orders that can be made in relation to a child, and service of such applications and their supporting documentation ought not to be treated as some superfluous afterthought within the related care proceedings. 

 
I am also surprised that the Guardian did not consider the omission worthy of any particular comment. Not least since this is a case in which there is a fundamental divergence of opinion being expressed in the supplemental reports of the two instructed experts, namely the independent social worker Yasmin Hossain and Consultant child Psychologist Dr Bashir, as to the capacity of C's parents to meet her needs, and as to the merits of any further attempts being made towards rehabilitation. In short Mrs Hossain supported the making of a final care order and placement of C in a substitute family, whereas Dr Bashir considered that therapeutic input for the family is likely to enhance the family's ability work in partnership with the professionals, and allow the safe rehabilitation of C to her family's care, which he considers to be in her best interests. Neither the professionals meeting organised by the Guardian in advance of the final hearing, nor further cross examination in oral evidence served to lessen the firm differences of opinion held between these two independent experts instructed in the case.

 
Three viability assessments were carried out by the Local Authority on other family members. Two assessments in relation to F's adult sons (C's half brothers) were positive, but were discontinued after they informed the Authority that they were unable to care for C in the long term. A third in relation to Mrs PA (another paternal relative) was positive but concluded negatively when the Special Guardianship assessment was commissioned, due to concerns about her health, and her lack of insight into the concerns raised by Local Authority in relation to C's parenting. More recently a fourth extended family member Mr AH together with his partner Ms AA were proposed and assessed as Special Guardians, but their assessment concluded that they were unsuitable to care for C's needs after it emerged that AH had an historic conviction for violence against a minor. 

 
During his oral evidence C's allocated social worker Mr Binesh Kappan outlined that despite a search of national data by the Local Authority's adoption team, there exists no Asian family able or willing to take a child with C's disability. He observed that 99% of Asian Muslim couples typically want a child without health needs. However he added that C's foster carers (who are white non-Muslims, but familiar with C's needs having looked after her since birth) are willing to be long-term linked to C under a care order. He said he had discussed the possibility of a special guardianship or adoption order with the female foster carer, as well as her right to oppose any special guardianship package, but that she would have to be assessed under the regulations as to her capacity to meet C's needs throughout her upbringing. It was noted that a possible obstacle to the foster parents' approval as C's long term carers may be that they and C's family now know each other, and continue to live in the same geographical area. 

 
Whilst the final care plan and supporting evidence refers to the Local Authority's intention to pursue a "robust adoption plan" the possible placement of C with her foster carers in the longer term was not referred to as an option. In her oral evidence the Guardian Mrs Johnson indicated that it is a "standard question" which she said she usually puts to any carer who has been a foster parent for some time. In this case Mrs Johnson said in her oral evidence that she had asked the female foster carer if she had considered taking on C's full time care in the future, and that she had responded that she had considered it, but had not mentioned it to the social worker, being aware of the 'cultural issues'. She indicated that if a better cultural match should not be available for C, then she would be willing to consider adopting her. 

 
It is apparent that a plan for C to remain with her foster carer was not one which had been considered until after completion of the Guardian's final report on 8 December 2014. In the tabular "Pros and Cons Analysis" included within that report, 'special guardianship' is not an order which has been considered, and it is argued under the option of 'long term fostering' that this will not provide the stability and permanence that C needs to reach her lifetime potential. A similar tabular analysis appearing in the Annexe B report complied by the Local Authority as recently as the 13th January 2014 does include consideration of a special guardianship order, but only in respect of C's extended family members, whilst under the option of 'long term foster care' it is recorded only that the foster carers "may inform that they are not able to meet C's long term needs" and that "there is no guarantee that C will have a consistent foster carer." The evidence as to the likely availability of a permanent alternative home for C outside of her family is presently therefore in a state of some uncertainty.

 
 In paragraph 3 of the final written submissions dated 27.1.2014 and filed by Miss White the Guardian's representative, the principal issues of concern which inform the Local Authority's case are succinctly summarised thus: "(i) The father's history of domestic violence and unresolved issues of allegations of domestic violence in the current relationship between the parents; (ii) An inability of both parents to fully understand and therefore meet all of C's medical needs; (iii) An unwillingness or inability of each of the parents to work in partnership with professionals who have sought to put in advice, guidance and assistance to support the return of C to her parents' care; and (iv) Despite stated good intentions, a lack of practical support from extended family members or any other support network".

 
On behalf of the parents it is submitted that the evidence supporting the first of Southend Borough Council's concerns relating to domestic violence all predates the commencement of these proceedings, and was taken into account by the Local Authority as well as the instructed experts when they concluded that this should not preclude C's rehabilitation to her family between April and June of last year. This point has some force to it, nevertheless I have also re-considered the evidence on its own merit since the risk of violence between her parents represents one of the aspects of prospective harm which C may be at risk of suffering, to which I must have regard under s1(3) (e) of the 1989 Act  as well as s1(4) (e) of the 2002 Act.

 
Prior to his marriage to M, F was involved in a live-in relationship of some 5 years with a Ms MJ, until an Ex Parte non molestation order and non-communication was made in the Bow County Court on 20th February 2008 for one year. Following this F was convicted of battery and criminal damage and a community order imposed as a result of damaging a door which he forced open, and as a result of grabbing his partner's jaw and pushing her against a wall during an argument on 24th March 2008. Although F pleaded guilty to this offence it is fair to say he minimised his responsibility somewhat by referring to the level of physical contact as having been very small and involving no injury, and attributing his guilty plea to advice he had received that even the slightest touch would be an assault. There is some suggestion that this order was replaced by an undertaking, and that this was also breached. Although F recalled that he had given an undertaking, he denied having breached it. The papers disclosed within the Court bundle did not include a copy of an undertaking or any order consequent upon a breach of one either. I note that in December 2008 (two months before the non molestation order expired) F was involved in a serious road accident in which he sustained head injuries as well as fractures to three of his four limbs and his ribs. Another non-molestation and non-communication order was however made on 15th October 2010 following an inter partes hearing. This arose as a result of numerous unwanted love letters and bunches of flowers which F continued to send to Ms MJ between July and August of 2010, and which also resulted in his conviction for harassment on 12 July 2011 when a fine and an indefinite restraining order were imposed upon him prohibiting him from contacting Ms MJ or going near where she lived. F accepted that he did send these items, but said that he did not think his communications were wrong at the time because they were not abusive. Within his multi-disciplinary psychiatric assessment of F Dr Bashir noted that F was clear and open about having missed his ex-partner when he was unwell following his road accident, and Dr Bashir considered that his disinhibited behaviour would be an expected consequence or result of his brain injury.  

 
On 11th July 2012 M attended Laindon Police Station to report through an interpreter that during an argument with her husband earlier that day, over her wish to telephone her family in Pakistan, he had slapped her around the face, pulled her hair, and punched her in the stomach. Although the Police recorded that she had no visible injuries, they noted that she was pregnant and due on 4th September, and that she also expressed concern for her health having suffered two previous miscarriages. In assessing the level of risk to the victim the Police interview covered a list of 29 specific pre-prepared questions designed to elicit further details such as the frequency of any abuse, and whether it entailed any threats from the perpetrator or others. In response to these questions M agreed that arguments with her husband were a daily occurrence and that this turned to violence 2 or 3 times a month, and was increasing in frequency, and that the abuse from her husband had also included threats to kill her, and that she was afraid of others in the house including her stepson and his wife who were unhappy that their father had remarried. 

 
On 12th July F was arrested, and when asked for an explanation in interview he conceded that he and his wife did have arguments in their marriage. He maintained and that his wife had said to him on many occasions that the British police always side with the woman in cases of domestic violence, and that she had threatened to accuse him of this and then divorce him, indicating that she believed she would then be entitled to half of an insurance payout he had received. F said he had never laid a hand on his wife and had never been violent to her, and that there had been three other people at home on the day, who could confirm that nothing had happened before she had stormed out saying she was going to the Police. He also suggested that she might want to get back with her ex husband and bring him over to this country.

 
Six weeks later on the 28th August 2012 M went in to the Police station to sign another statement in which she retracted her previous complaint stating that she wanted to get back with her husband, that no one had forced her to retract, that she had made the decision on her own, and that she would not support a prosecution, even though she understood her husband might still be charged and she might be ordered to give evidence against him. In the event due to lack of evidence, no further police action was taken beyond a referral to social services at the time of the complaint. 

 
In her written statement of 18th October 2012 M maintained as she has done throughout these proceedings that she lied to the Police, and said the things she did as the result of listening to other people, to prevent her marriage breaking down. She said she was afraid that her husband was going to leave her for MJ, and believed at the time that if she made a false complaint to the Police it would deter him from doing so. She says she tried to explain to social workers who came to see her at the time of C's birth that her husband had been using MJ's name rather than hers on a daily basis and was afraid that her husband's former relationship with MJ which had led to the break up of his first marriage, might do the same to hers. She denied that they had argued over her calling her family Pakistan, stating that her husband had in fact bought her a mobile phone and calling cards so she could do so. Whilst conceding they had minor arguments like other couples, M firmly denied that F had ever hit her or threatened to kill her, and confirmed her relationship with her step son K and his wife was also a good one.

 
I asked Dr Bashir during his oral evidence whether he did not think it perhaps counter intuitive for M to have reported her husband to the Police if she wished to save her marriage. He did not. He explained that given her unsuccessful first marriage and her husband addressing her as his ex-partner M had become paranoid, and somewhat isolated, since she was not socialising when she first entered the country, and was therefore exploitable. He said that F's inappropriate use of words, whilst unhelpful, were also more likely to be due to poor word finding and impulsive speech rather than a romantic drift towards his ex-partner. Back in December 2012 Dr Bashir noted that F was insightful that the name "MJ" comes out when he is distracted and less vigilant.

 
He said that M had explained that a relative had advised her that going to the Police was the way of teaching your husband a lesson in this country, and that here you might get half the property on any divorce. In her oral evidence M was particularly tearful in repeating her regret time and again for having lied to the Police. She said that in Pakistan when a spouse makes a complaint to the Police the authorities usually require the couple to undertake mediation, and it was evident that she considered herself primarily responsible for the Local Authority's intervention in her family's life because of what she had done.

 
It is not possible to make any satisfactory findings on the evidence as to whether or not M's complaint against her husband was wholly or even partially true. However it is notable that apart from those original allegations made by M there is no other evidence of domestic violence within the parents' relationship. Over the course of the last 17 months it is fair to observe that the couple have been heavily monitored by numerous professionals including social workers, medical staff, and four family support workers who have spent extended periods of time in their company (approaching 120 hours in all) both within the family home and outside of it. On behalf of M it is submitted that although there are a limited number of references to normal tensions within the family home, the contact notes are otherwise littered with positives about how the mother and father get on well, work well as a team and support each other in difficult circumstances. That is true, and whilst it is clearly important to bear in mind that the history points to F having the potential for domestic violence, this must be balanced against the contrary evidence which does not indicate that such potential has manifest itself in this marriage, in any discernable way such as to present a significant risk of harm to C. F can be fairly criticised for being controlling and overbearing at times, not just domestically, but to the world at large. He is used to running a large dry cleaning business with a number of outlets, and being much older than M with 6 adult children of his own, he doubtless considers he has greater experience of parenting than does his wife. I accept that as a young and a new mother, who has lost two children prior to giving birth to C, M is generally cautious and conscientious in her approach to parenting her daughter, but the evidence also indicated that she is capable of asserting her own considered view to her husband, and to the family support workers who worked with her, no doubt helped by the role which they were instructed to undertake in assisting to empower her generally.  I do not doubt that M may well defer to her husband's experience and 'louder' demeanour, but I discerned no evidence of a violent or controlling relationship, during the twelve days over which I observed them in Court. On one particular occasion during the evidence when M was asked to comment on some photographs of C, which she was told had been provided to counsel by her husband in order to illustrate C's appearance on a particular date, I noted that she was able to assert that her husband was wrong if he believed they had been taken on that date. Her recollection of C's age in the photograph was careful and considered, and I noted that having listened to what his wife said, F was able to accept it. 

 
It was also Dr Bashir's professional observation that in his sessions with the parents they did not present as a discordant couple, but rather on the whole they showed much mutuality, partnership and comradeship. He observed that this might arise from adversity and a common mission, however he also noticed that each showed a respect for the other. He was criticised for having a lack of insight into the risks of domestic violence, but responded that the evidence of the parents' improved relationship came not just from his own examination of how they dealt with each other in his sessions, but from their relatives and from 120 hours of Family support workers' reports. They openly admitted that they argued, and he accepted that it is hard to say where 'normal' starts and ends in that regard. However he observed that from a child's perspective it is the intensity rather than the frequency of arguments which matters more to children. He opined that seeing your parents have an argument is not out of the ordinary, rather it is the model of showing cruelty to a partner then following it by saying "I love you" which can compromise a child's development. Coming from a consultant psychiatrist who has been involved in medico-legal work since 1989, I found Dr Bashir's observations in relation to the nature of the parents' relationship both insightful and deserving of weight.

 
In her addendum report dated 6th September 2013 the independent social worker Mrs Hossain set out the strengths and concerns she had noted in the parents ability to meet C's needs under the subheading "Analysis and Opinion". These were informed by her observations of the family made between 1.20pm and 4pm on 16th August 2013 when she had visited both parents with C in the family home. Additionally she gleaned information from family support worker Fatima Abbas who was present, as well as the foster parents' diary, and other information provided by the Local Authority which she had read.

 
Under 'strengths' Mrs Hossain noted  that M was now less reliant on her husband than she had been 5 months ago, and demonstrated a good degree of independence, and significant confidence in her own abilities. It was noted that she was now in greater contact with other ladies in the community as a result of attending ESOL classes as well as two child centred groups with C, and that she was making excellent progress with her spoken English. Mrs Hossain noted both parents to be very affectionate towards C both verbally and in terms of their tactile affection. It was clear to her that both of them take great pleasure in talking about their daughter and narrate her achievements with enormous pride. She also noted that C shows a very good attachment to both parents. Mrs Hossain observed that C recognises her parents as "special", in that she delights at seeing them or hearing their voices, and that she generally looks around for them, and visibly and audibly 'lights up' when they enter the room. It was Mrs Hossain's view that M has a good ability to provide a good standard of basic care to her daughter, and that great attention is paid to hygiene washing and care routines, with advice being followed to ensure she is not exposed to an unclean environment. The bedroom which the parents shared with C was also described as a quiet and pleasant environment, whilst a variety of stimulating toys were observed within the home, and the parents were noted to engage and sit playing with C at her level on the floor.

 
Mrs Hossain next set out in her report the aspects of concern to her in relation to the parents' care. Her first concern formed a key aspect of the Local Authority's wider concern that the parents are unable to understand and therefore meet all of C's medical needs. To begin with Mrs Hossain expressed her concern that F had denied having had C's dietary routine explained to him by the social worker or foster carer, and this, Mrs Hossain felt, was in contrast to the advice about dietary intake and routines which she understood the Social worker Mr Kappan and family support worker Ms Abbas had given to them. She nevertheless noted that F did have the sheets provided by C's dietician, and that the family support worker had noted a recent discussion about this indicating that F did have some understanding of its importance. In his oral evidence F refuted that he had complained about the adequacy of any explanation of C's dietary regime, and acknowledged that he had received all of C's diet sheets and discussed them with C's dietician.  

 
Even so, Mrs Hossain expressed her concern that the parents were not able to follow a dietary routine for C 'cohesively'. A schedule of meals which the parents had given to C between 13 August and 4 September was prepared, and Mrs Hossain was concerned that the meals were not being given to C in a routine way, that is to say with breakfast, lunch and supper being given at set times, with snacks in between. She noted that the times when lunch or snacks were given would vary. She also observed that the parents had been advised that C would usually be fed in the foster home at 5pm, so that if the parents fed C a heavy meal late in the afternoon, her meal at the foster home could be disrupted. Mrs Hossain noted three occasions when C had been fed after 3pm, and she therefore expressed her concern that the parents' failure to adhere to consistent routines would directly impact on C's health and welfare in the future.

 
 In oral evidence Mrs Hossain was asked to consider a report made by the family support worker when the parents visited the dietician with C on 16th September 2013. This records that the Dietician assessed C and said she was doing well, and that her height and weight was good for her age. On that occasion C's dietician considered a diet plan sheet which the parents and foster carer had been asked to complete over the previous two weeks, and the dietician expressed her pleasure that C was being given a variety of foods including pulses pilchards and vegetables. Evidently she also said that she was impressed that both the parents and carers were providing C with a good two-meal diet and a good range of snacks. There is also no reference to the foster carer making any complaint about C's dietary routine at this meeting, although she was present.  

 
The dietary schedule prepared by Mrs Hossain had covered the period from 13 August to the 4th September and she therefore surmised that perhaps the dietician had been provided with a subsequent schedule when improvements may have been made. It was suggested on behalf of the parents that a similar variety of foods and routine had been replicated in those two weeks. 

 
In my judgment the points raised by Mrs Hossain in relation to the parents' capacity to ensure C's dietary needs are met, transpired to be of rather less concern than they might once have seemed to be, in the context of C's general health and development. During the adjournment over Christmas, and after Mrs Hossain's evidence was concluded, questions were put to C's dietician Mrs K Monk by letter. In her replies dated 8 January 2014 she wrote " a child does not have to have breakfast lunch and dinner, with snacks in between. They could get the same nutrition from 6 smaller meals. This was not being achieved with the foods offered in July 2013, however the food diary presented at the review appointment on September 2013 indicated a better intake of nutritious foods and the components of a better diet were now included. If C was being fed less often then there would be fewer opportunities for her to achieve adequate nutrition, however it could still be achieved. Conversely if she were to be offered foods more frequently than advised it could lead to 'over nutrition' and result in excessive weight gain. However as stated previously some children prefer to take smaller meals more frequently. It is all about dietary balance and providing a range of nutrients from a variety of foods from the core food groups". If C's dietary balance was imperfect in July 2013, the evidence indicates that it was rectified thereafter, whilst all the reports which I have read indicate that C has continued to gain weight and height and that there have been no concerns about her physical development.  In a report dated 6th December 2012 Consultant Paediatrician Dr Margarson observed that many babies with Goldenhar Syndrome  have poor weight gain in the first year of life, and it was for this reason, although C was feeding well, that Dr Margarson referred her to the dietician expecting that she may benefit from taking milk with a higher calorie content. During the course of the hearing it was confirmed that at December 2013 C was discharged from dietetic care, her weight and diet being that of any other normal child of her age.

 
Due to the fact that she has only one kidney C needs to be provided with a regular intake of water to prevent infection. A concern was voiced by the Guardian when she visited to observe the parents with C on 24.10.13, that F was so preoccupied in talking with herself, that he did not feed his daughter any water for the first hour. On the other hand when assessed by Dr Bashir, the parents evidenced a responsible appreciation of their daughter's need for regular water intake, as they did when observed by their family support workers, who logged the parents regular provision of drinks such as milk and water as well as snacks throughout their written reports, and during their oral evidence. The weight of the evidence does not suggest that C has suffered any significant harm from lack of liquid intake to date, and the evidence does not satisfy me that C would be likely to suffer significant harm in the future from parental neglect of her dietary needs in respect of food or drink.  

 
It was back in 6th December 2012 when C was only three months old that Dr Margarson prepared her report in relation to C's condition and her likely future medical needs, at the Local Authority's request. That report details that C was referred to a consultant endocrinologist at Great Ormond St. Hospital so that the results of her regular blood tests could be monitored, and her daily medication for hypothyroidism adjusted when necessary. The report states that she was also referred to a Consultant ophthalmologist due to concern that her visual maturation may be delayed. In addition due to concerns that C has conductive hearing loss in her right ear, she was referred for a specialist paediatric hearing assessment. At that time it was thought likely that she would require input from a speech and language therapist in the future as well as input from a teacher for the deaf. Dr Margarson also listed a number of other congenital abnormalities that might be expected to occur as a result of C's Goldenhar syndrome. Whilst she stated that most individuals are born with normal intelligence, she observed that learning difficulties may occur in about  13% of cases, whilst language problems as a result of deafness, and swallowing difficulties may also arise. She noted that plastic surgeons would now be able to improve the appearance of C's face and that she would be likely to need ongoing orthodontic treatment.

 
Bearing in mind that it is the Local Authority's case that the parents are unable to understand and therefore meet C's complex medical needs, repeated requests were made on behalf of the parents for a current report from Dr Margarson updating C's medical needs in the light of her development over the intervening year. The parents do not deny that their daughter does have complex and varied medical needs, but they are adamant that they are able to manage them. During his oral evidence social worker Binesh Kappan stated that Dr Margarson had prepared an 'adoption medical report' which he had read and which indicated that C was doing much better than had been originally feared. However for reasons which remained unclear the Local Authority was unable to produce that document or indeed any other up-to-date paediatric overview of C's medical needs. A copy of one letter written by Mr Kappan to Dr Margarson was produced, which requested comments on C's progress and current prognosis, but it was only written on 6th January 2014. 

 
One document entitled "Looked after children review health assessment" which was completed by nurse Diana Cattermole on 18 November 2013 was produced. This indicated that C has good physical health, that she is meeting her developmental milestones, and presents as an emotionally balanced and stable child, who is happy and settled in her foster placement. The annexe B report provides some further details about how C is now making different speech sounds and conversational noises and has been heard to say 'dada'. Her physical development is said to be showing progress and she is able to hold onto a support in order to stand and showing signs of walking without support. Since her birth it is noted that she has not been admitted to hospital for any reason pertaining to her health needs and disability. When he re-assessed the parents in September 2013 Dr Bashir concluded that the parents were well able to meet C's medical needs and he found no evidence that they either had not or would not work well with the various medical professionals involved with their daughter. 

 
Dr Bashir said he was impressed at C's developmental progress, indicating that she would have less difficulty than either he or Dr Margarson had initially envisaged, and that despite the 13% who experience a more difficult cognitive recovery, 'C's prognosis for cognitive recovery is pretty good'. He agreed that she would continue to need endocrinology input due to her thyroid malfunction and single kidney, and that her lip and hearing may be affected. Apart from that he opined that C's intellectual and physical development should reach normal levels, she now has trunkal control and her walking is improving with a stroller. He observed that the parents derived much gratification from stimulating their daughter that they had aspirations for her education and to provide her with safe care, and he considered that their positive influence on C during contact was considerable.

 
Whilst there was no evidence to suggest that the parents had failed to manage C's daily medication appropriately, criticism was levelled at F for refusing to allow C to be immunised for TB until he had taken advice. At the time he said he had been concerned that C was too young for the vaccination, and on his behalf it was submitted that F did no more than many a responsible parent who seeks to be fully informed first. Since C was later immunised, and there was no evidence to suggest that C's safety was endangered by the delay, I think the submission ventured on his behalf was fairly made.

 
With regard to C's potential need for plastic surgery to her face in the future, it was suggested that because of their unconditional love for their daughter F and M are somewhat blinkered as to C's facial deformity, and do not appreciate the impact it may have upon her self esteem, if surgery is not undertaken to improve her appearance as she grows older. Whilst not denying that she may need facial surgery the parents have expressed that they will 'wait and see' whether C will need this in the future. In this respect the Local Authority and Guardian expressed particular concern that the parents gave C a very short hair cut following a looked after child review and surmised they may have deliberately arranged to shave her head in order to reveal her deformed ear, having heard that the Local Authority proposed that C be adopted. It was Mr Kappan's evidence that before it was cut, C's hair had been long enough to cover the deformed ear and provide a 'cushion' for her head in the event of any fall. The Guardian referred to this allegation in paragraph 20e of her final analysis detailing that 'whilst she screamed, C's head had been completely shaved by a barber', and that the parents had failed to provide any reasonable explanation for their actions. However in her evidence the Guardian accepted that this account had been provided to her by Mr Kappan the social worker, and that she had not seen C for herself between May and October 2013. During the hearing a number of photographs of C were produced by Mr and M. One group were clearly taken at a birthday party which was said to have been taken on 4 September 2013 which was C's first birthday. In these she has short slightly wavy hair which reaches down to the top of her right ear lobe but which does not cover her disfigured ear at all. Another group of pictures which appear from C's general face shape to have been taken when she was of similar age, show her with shorter more closely cropped hair which is still thick and dark enough to cover her head, and which does not appear to have been 'shaved'. These were said by C's parents to have been taken respectively on 19th  September and during October 2013, that is to say within days or weeks of her haircut. In the light of what has been written about C's facial disfigurement, I was also surprised to see how little her facial deformities presently appear to diminish the appeal of C's lively and attractive young face, in both sets of pictures. In the light of those pictures I am afraid I did conclude that Mr Kappan's criticism of the parents' disregard for their daughter's appearance, had been significantly overstated.

 
In his September report Dr Bashir stated that he could find no evidence that C would be at risk of physical or emotional abuse if returned to her parents' care. He said that he had gained the impression that the parents had a high regard for medical opinion and anything that the hospital advised. He considered it 'largely unlikely that they would not go to C's medical appointments'. 

 
In her report the Guardian expressed her concern that the parents 'minimise' the seriousness of their daughter's medical condition and refuse to acknowledge her disabilities. This was in part due to her feeling F did not appear to accept that C may need plastic surgery in the future when he replied "we will see". I have referred to my findings in relation to this to this above. I also note around the same time as the Guardian was making her assessment, Dr Bashir was making his, and it was the latter's observation that the parents had a good understanding of their daughter's medical conditions. In weighing those two differing impressions I think it must be right to give greater weight to those of Dr Bashir if only because his medical qualifications give him a more informed basis upon which to do so.

 
On the other hand the Local Authority was critical of F's decision during the rehabilitation programme to miss a dietician's appointment in favour of going to the airport to collect his wife who had just returned from a brief visit to Pakistan after her brother had been taken gravely ill. In evidence he explained that he did not request another family member to collect his wife so that he might attend the appointment, only because he considered it important that he should go himself, just in case his wife should be detained for questioning at immigration control. As the husband he considered he would be best placed to assist resolve any problem at immigration, particularly since his wife's English was limited and this was the first occasion on which she had re-entered Britain since their marriage. In my judgement it may be easy to underestimate problems which are not generally experienced by the indigenous population at passport control, but which are a worrying reality to those who are not, and I do not think that this single missed appointment can be magnified into a general indicator that the parents would be likely to avoid attending C's health appointments in the future.

 
Another occasion on which concern was expressed about the parents' motivation to seek medical attention for C occurred on 14.5.2013. At the time C was having overnight staying contact with her parents as part of the rehabilitation plan. When the Family support worker Shagufta Arif arrived at 8.00am she noted that C was smiling but looking poorly with a runny nose and a cough. Her mother said that C had been unwell through the night and that she had only been able to get her to sleep by holding her in her lap. Ms Arif recorded in her note F's comment that C had appeared healthy in the morning, but said that she had nevertheless proposed that it may be best to take C to the hospital. She noted that F had suggested waiting till 10.30 as C would be returning to the foster carers soon. Ms Arif then indicated that she wished to telephone the social worker Mr Kappan for his opinion. She noted that F explained this to his wife when she came into the room, and that M replied: "we could take her to the hospital". Ms Arif then spoke to Mr Kappan on the telephone and he evidently advised that he thought it best if the parents took C to hospital. Ms Arif next noted that when she returned to the room M observed that C did not have a temperature anymore, and Ms Arif rejoined that she would rather not take the risk as C was not able to keep her eyes open. Her note next recorded that F duly arranged for a cab which took them all to hospital. 

 
During the hearing there was an issue about whose idea it had been to take C to the hospital first. M had indicated in paragraph 36 that it was she and her husband who had decided to take her, whereas Ms Arif was positive that it had been her idea. I note that in her contemporaneous note Ms Arif records that her own suggestion to take C to the hospital was made whilst M was out of the room, and that M's first remark after speaking to her husband and upon returning to the room was: "we could take her to the hospital". In the final submissions made on behalf of the Guardian it is said that the family support worker argued that "the parents refused to take C for medical attention". My note did not indicate that Ms Arif went that far in her evidence, but if she did, then it was not recorded in her contemporaneous notes, which in general I consider likely to have been more reliable than her recall so long after the event. After listening to the parties' evidence I did not find the dispute about who first suggested taking C to hospital served in anyway to support the conclusion that the parents were unmotivated to seek help for their daughter. Nor did I find that the family support worker's notes or the contact diary supported the contention that M or F "refused to take their daughter to hospital".

 
The next area of concern identified in Mrs Hossain's report related to the parents' capacity to work constructively with professionals, and it is this aspect which forms a central and probably the most significant concern informing the Local Authority's case. Mrs Hossain noted that whilst she had felt positive about the parents' levels of co-operation with herself and Dr Bashir when they were first assessed, she considered on reflection that she may have been over-optimistic in this regard. This was in the light of what she described as F's angry tirades against the social worker Mr Binesh Kappan which frequently punctuated his discussions with her during her second assessment.  F articulated his firm belief that the social worker was deliberately sabotaging C's placement at home, by instructing family support workers, contact workers, and other professionals including the Guardian to write misleading negative reports. Mrs Hossain described F's anxieties in this regard as "obsessive and paranoid", and she expressed her "serious doubts and a concern about the couple's ability to work with professionals" as a result. She noted that: "F and M project blame on every individual who question(s) criticise(s) or offer(s) advice to the point when it is not only exhausting but places C at risk of harm. Both parents are very challenging with F particularly having a tendency to be vocal loud and very angry. They display very rigid views and any advice is seen as criticism". 

 
Referring to the notes of Fatima Abbas a Family Support Worker, Mrs Hossain also referred to occasions during August when M seemed to be co-operating well but then at times seemed not to want to take advice; or, after doing well in following advice about how to hold or feed C, she was seen to slip back into her old ways, giving the indication that she did not like being nagged.

 
Mrs Hossain's fourth concern is similar to her third in that it relates to the parents antagonistic approach to the Local Authority personnel, which she concludes leads them to be extremely manipulative, and in F's case impulsive. One Example she cited was F's contention that a family support worker Shagufta Arif had "hit" his wife at the children's centre on 20th May, whereas in her notes Ms Arif recorded she had only "tapped M on the shoulder" to draw her attention. However the parents told Mrs Hossain that they had taken their solicitor's advice about bringing an assault claim against Shagufta Arif, as a result.

 
Undoubtedly the most contentious example cited by Mrs Hossain of the parents antagonism towards professionals and/or manipulation, relates to the parents' account of a meeting which took place at the family home on 29th May 213 attended by Social worker Mr Binesh Kappan, an interpreter Shabir Sethi,  Family Support worker Shiara Khatun, and the Guardian Sue Johnson. The parents informed Mrs Hossain that Ms Khatun had physically examined M's stomach to check if she was pregnant. This they said had been at the instruction of the Guardian after the latter had remarked on the size of M's belly, and asked if she was pregnant. It is not in dispute that the Guardian did drawn attention to the size of M's stomach, and did ask if she was pregnant. It is not disputed that F rejoined that his wife had a problem with a hernia about which she had seen the Doctor, and that she may need an operation soon.  However the Guardian firmly refutes that she gave any instruction to Ms Khatun to examine M's stomach, or that M was in fact examined by Ms Khatun on that day. The Social worker Mr Kappan, confirmed the Guardian's account as did Ms Khatun in a written statement which she was asked to provide on 11.0.13. 

 
In their oral evidence M and F emphatically held to their account. A family member PA who was present at the time in adjacent room caring for C throughout the meeting, also gave evidence that she had seen the examination take place through the door which was ajar. F maintained he had later asked Ms Khatun why she had examined his wife's stomach, and that she had told him that she had done it because the Guardian had told her to do so. He therefore concluded that she had only later signed a statement denying this when asked to do so by the local Authority, in order to safeguard her job. 

 
Following this meeting M visited her GP Dr Siddique in order to obtain 'proof' that she was not pregnant, stating that during a visit from the social work department on 29th May a support worker had examined her stomach and she had been told she was pregnant and needed to see her GP as she has quite a large abdomen. Having examined her, the doctor confirmed in a letter dated 6 June 2013 that whilst M has some excess of fat over her girth, there were no signs of pregnancy and a urine test had reported negative. The Guardian Sue Johnson was particularly aggrieved that this letter appeared to show that the parents had been able to 'manipulate' a medical professional into accepting their account, since within the letter the Doctor had observed; "I have no other ways of collaborating [sic] this information but I do find it highly irregular that a non-clinically trained individual should examine a person and I have asked her to report this to the appropriate authorities". I will return to my findings in relation to the events of 29th May 2013 in due course.

 
In my judgment there can be no question but that the relationship between the parents and the social work professionals involved with the family (including the Guardian) took a serious turn for the worse following the looked after child review on 16th May 2013 when, as indicated above, the working relationships had been sufficiently positive for all those present to conclude that a return of C to her parents under a supervision order, ( and with gradually reducing levels of supervision,) would be effected during June. This is not to say that in the early days of the Local Authority's involvement with the family, they had not found F quite difficult to work with. The minutes of an induction meeting which took place on 27th March 2013 illustrate how Mr Kappan had had to spent some time explaining the role of the family support workers, and how F could not treat them as 'friends' coming into his home, and how he must appreciate that the Local Authority was in charge. Nevertheless it is also apparent that once the rehabilitation plan was underway, a productive working alliance was forged which was largely reflected in the family support workers notes which began at the end of March. It is accordingly necessary to examine the events which took place shortly before and following  the positive looked after child review of 16th May, to the extent that they shed light upon the possible reasons for this dramatic change, a change which ultimately led the Local Authority to abandon any hope of the rehabilitation plan succeeding.

 
I accept (as was submitted on behalf of M) that the notes taken by the family support workers show that the basic care provided by the parents is very good. Each family support worker agreed that the home was clean and tidy and that the parents have a warm and loving bond with C. family support worker Ms Arif also agreed that the mother was cooperative and listened to advice, and noted on 20th May that she 'just gets on with being a mother'.  It is apparent that during her work Ms Arif also reassured the mother about how well she was doing on numerous occasions, one particular example being on 3rd May 2013 when the mother had become upset having misunderstood the timetable for rehabilitation was much slower than she had believed it to be. In her statement prepared for this hearing on 5th July 2013 Ms Arif was however rather more critical of their levels of co-operation. 

 
I have already mentioned the circumstances in which F and M together with family support worker Shagufta Arif visited hospital with C on 14th May 2013. At the hospital appointment Ms Arif narrates that the doctor had asked F how much liquid C had drunk, and when he had replied "7 ounces" she had interjected and said " That's incorrect she had 2 ounces". She added that " the father was very rude and snapped at me for speaking". Having listened to the oral evidence of Ms Arif and F on this matter I have no doubt that each of them thought they were correct, and that F felt humiliated as a  result of being contradicted by Ms Arif in front of the doctor. Although it was implied that F may have been attempting to mislead the doctor, I am satisfied in the light of the information which was recorded in C's feeding diary that he was not. F had correctly totalled the liquid which his baby daughter had been given since 6:00am that morning, whereas Ms Arif, who had only arrived at 8:00am, had simply calculated the amounts which she had observed being fed to C since the time of her arrival. It was also apparent that Ms Arif was unaware of that discrepancy between her own calculation and what appeared in C's feed diary, until it was pointed to her out in cross examination, and so it is probable that she did not appreciate that there could be any justifiable reason for F's sense of grievance over what she had done.

 
In the ensuing week a series of individually small events served to consolidate the friction between them. On 20th May when Ms Arif arrived at the family home shortly before 2pm, F advised her that his wife was out shopping, and so they left with C for the Sure Start centre without her. When M arrived at the centre some 15 minutes later, Ms Arif noted that she snatched up C and hugged her close. It is evident she felt some suspicion about where M had been, when she said she had been out shopping for a jumper nappies and baby monitor. A little later after Ms Arif had noted the contents of her bag, M admitted that she had not got the monitor because her English had not been good enough to find one. Ms Arif then cross questioned her as to where she had been, suggesting that her clothes looked as if she had been out in them all night.   Whilst Ms Arif described M as being 'snappy' with her on this occasion, I suspect that impression may have been mutual. On the following day the 21st May Ms Arif recorded that M was 'snapping' at her again whenever she asked an innocuous question. She said when she greeted C or sought to show the child physical affection by kissing her, her mother would move  C abruptly away. She stated that M did not look at her when replying to questions, and seemed annoyed and moody, pretending not to hear on a couple of occasions. Because of this Ms Arif noted that she found her difficult to approach or work with. 

 
Although Ms Arif sought to maintain in evidence that she was a 'professional' who took such ups and downs in her stride, I am satisfied that her reactions was very much more emotional than she was prepared to admit on this occasion. She had by then become accustomed to sharing their family life at quite an intimate level, including participating in their meals. In my judgement she was sufficiently hurt by M's rejecting behaviour at this point, that she abruptly departed the family home that day, leaving C without the supervision which she was contracted to provide. Notably she did not mention this in either her notes or her statement, not was this departure mentioned elsewhere in the Local Authority's evidence. 

 
On the 23rd May the social worker Mr Kappan arranged a meeting at the family home to discuss what had happened between parents and their support worker Ms Arif. He asked Shagufta Arif to attend as well in order that she might translate what M might have to say. I accept the submissions made on behalf of M that this placed both women in an extremely awkward position, with Ms Arif having to translate M's grievances against herself, and vice versa. It was a poor professional judgment, which did little to enhance their working relationship. When M suggested that her solicitor would send him an email, Ms Arif noted that Mr Kappan replied: "I do not care about any solicitor, I want to know what happened this second�so tell me, and also Shagufta will be translating everything". F pointed out that the issues were about Shagufta, and he was getting her to translate, and Mr Kappan rejoined that she was a family support worker and they would not be paying for anyone else to translate. A measure of the anger and upset felt by Ms Arif is reflected in her note where she states Mr Kappan told her not to reply back, and just to translate, which led her to reply: "I am trying to do my best, but it's very hard because it feels as a personal attack" and shortly after that she left the room in tears saying she had to get out.

 
It was at this point that overnight contact was terminated. In his evidence Mr Kappan said this was because there was no Punjabi speaking family support worker available, although when there was, it did not resume. As a temporary measure family support worker Shiara Khatun was supplied by the agency, although her Punjabi was limited, she could understand a little Urdu and she began work on 29th May and continued until she was replaced on 7th July. The 29th May was the occasion of the meeting at the family home with the social worker and Guardian when remark was made upon the size of M's stomach, and question was raised as to whether she may be pregnant. In her oral evidence Ms Khatun was asked if anyone had requested her to physically examine M then or at any other time. Ms Khatun paused to reflect before responding "no I wasn't asked." In responding to questions concerning M's account of her stomach having been touched, Ms Khatun replied that she "did not remember" touching M's stomach, but she did remember that her stomach had protruded, and that she had looked pregnant. She did not consider her relationship with the family had been impacted in any way as a result of that meeting. 

 
In commenting upon her observations within the family home she said she could not remember any time when the kitchen and home environment was not clean and tidy. She said that the parents had kept C clean and that their hygiene standards were consistently good. She noted that they took out the communication book upon C's arrival in the morning, and regularly looked at it, and that since M wanted to know what the routine to follow was, she would ask her to translate it. She confirmed they had been consistent in their feeding and nappy changing, and had responded appropriately when C had a teething problems or an eye infection. In relation to C's routine of feeding she noted that M was able to work out for herself when milk or solids should be given and gave them appropriately to C, including on those occasions when she was worried that the foster mother had not written the time of feeding C in the book. She said she observed mother and daughter together with and without F and she did well, and the couple interacted well together with their baby and as between themselves. On one occasion when they noted that C was not keeping her fluids down, she confirmed that the parents took their daughter promptly to hospital, and she went along too and saw that they were calm, co-operative and communicated well with the medical staff. She also accompanied them to weaning classes at the Summercourt centre, and noted M's interest in ESOL classes for English and counselling. In June she considered it a positive step when she was instructed by Mr Kappan to employ more observation and less intervention so as to 'empower' M, and give the parents more autonomy, and it was her view that overall the parents had been consistently co-operative. Although it was the Local Authority's contention that the parents' relationship with each of their family support workers became difficult, I did not find that the evidence supported any breakdown in the parents relationship with Ms Khatun, and accept that she ceased to work with them when a suitable alternative worker who could speak their language more easily was eventually found

 
With regard to the meeting on 29th May I heard the oral evidence of Mr Kappan, Ms Khatun, both parents and their relative Ms PA and finally Sue Johnson the Guardian. I make it clear at the outset that I do not accept that the Guardian instructed anyone to undertake a physical examination of M on that occasion, nor do I accept that M was physically examined in the rough manner which she, her husband, and Mrs PA portrayed. I do think it likely that when Mrs Johnson drew attention to the size of M's belly (which may have been particularly visible in traditional Asian dress) and questioned whether she was pregnant before the assembled company, she probably engendered a particular sense of shame and embarrassment in M, not least because of the male presence in the room. Ms Khatun's response in evidence that she "did not remember touching M's stomach" struck me as rather ambivalent, and it seemed to me entirely possible that in turning to observe M's stomach after attention had been drawn to it, Ms Khatun may, however unwittingly, have made contact with her clothing and bare skin in doing so. It is unlikely that M would have understood sufficient English to know whether or not Mrs Johnson had made any request of Ms Khatun at all. However it is quite possible that she may have discerned that some remark about her stomach had originated from Mrs Johnson, and so determined that the Guardian should be blamed for the humiliation which she considered had been dealt her. In doing so, I think she decided to exaggerate her alleged physical injury and the story grew in the telling. I did not find either F or Mrs PA's account of having witnessed any physical examination of M, particularly credible and consider they were simply repeating an account given to them which they had resolved to support.

 
This particular allegation engendered a very great deal of attention in the oral evidence, and I accept that the Guardian has been justifiably vexed if not outraged by the fact that it was made. On behalf of the parents I was reminded (as in criminal cases) that a Lucas direction is appropriate, and that it should be born in mind that an untruth may be told for many reasons, and does not  necessarily prove that everything else the individual says is untrue. In the case of Y(a child) [2013] EWCA Civ 1337 (3 October 2013) The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal in a case which Lady Justice Macur hallmarked as having been  "Hijacked by the issue of the mother's dishonesty". She went on to observe that "Much of the local authority's evidence is devoted to it.� The Children's Guardian adopts much the same perspective.� It cannot be the sole issue in a case devoid of context."  In particular she was critical that "No analysis appears to have been made by any of the professionals as to why the mother's particular lies created the likelihood of significant harm to these children and what weight should reasonably be afforded to the fact of her deceit in the overall balance."

 
In this case I have particularly born in mind the level of weight that should reasonably be accorded to the fact of the parents' deceit regarding the issue of  M's alleged  physical examination at the Guardian's behest. The lie cannot be said to have had any direct impact on C, and it is difficult to see how the telling of it was likely to have gained the family any material advantage in these proceedings. However it has substantially impaired the capacity of the professional social workers to trust the family, particularly since they apprehend that they might be on the receiving end of similar untrue allegations in the future.

 
As a result the guardian articulated the view at paragraph 16 of her final analysis that "throughout these proceedings the family, although F in particular, appears to have led a campaign to discredit any professional who questioned their parenting capacity.  The extent of this has now become such that I am concerned it has become all -consuming to the family. It is my view that this has caused them to lose focus on what this case is about � the welfare of C". Conversely it was put to the Guardian that in fact it is not the family who have become consumed by this allegation but rather she who could no longer objectively assess the welfare of the child because she had become blinkered by what she perceived to be a personal attack on her professionalism and integrity. 

 
I will return to my conclusions in relation to the Guardian's viewpoint in due course, however in considering the parents capacity to work in partnership with the professionals who have been working to advise guide or assist them in seeking the return of C, the evidence must be considered beyond the point of this particular event as well.

 

In their written evidence the parents express their opinion that they considered the social worker Binesh Kappan to have been against them from the start and bent on C's adoption. F suggested that this may be because Mr Kappan is Hindu and anti-Muslim. I do not accept on the evidence that the parents suspicions are correct on either count, and it is plain if only from the minutes of the looked after child review in the middle of last May that Mr Kappan was both positive about the parents and supportive of progressing the plan towards reunification of C with them. Both parents indicated that they felt patronised and condescended to, or at times treated contemptuously. In F's case I have little doubt that he felt as sense of affront to his self esteem when Mr Kappan made it clear to him to him that it was he (on behalf of the Local Authority) who was 'in charge' back in March 2013. Equally I accept that this may have been a vernacular expression necessary to make F understand the role of the Local Authority now that it was sharing parental responsibility under the interim care order. It may well have helped had there been a little more transparency over the marital relationship between Mr Kappan and the family's previous social worker, since when the parents discovered it for themselves it only served to foster further mistrust, however unreasonably. Equally I do consider that the Local Authority's practice of using the family support workers as interpreters when difficult information had to be shared, was unhelpful and contributed to the strain. In her written analysis at paragraph 23 the Guardian observed unequivocally "I entirely disagree with the suggestion by the family that the Local Authority has acted in any way inappropriately" and "No criticism at all should be directed (at) the Local Authority". However during cross examination she was constrained to admit that it was "possibly not best practice" to have used Shagufta Arif to interpret after she had walked out on the family, adding that she had "rarely met a case where there had not been some mistakes"

 
During the course of the hearing, a copy of the Independent Reporting Officer's report complied following a looked after child review meeting on 18.9.2013 was produced. It was on this occasion that the Local Authority decided to inform the parents that their plan was to arrange for C's adoption outside the family. This was notwithstanding that the social worker Binesh Kappan was away and could not attend. Moreover the Guardian was not present and said she did not recall being invited. In addition no translator had been pre arranged to assist M. Instead of re-scheduling what was likely to be a particularly emotional meeting for the parents, those present decided to telephone the Family support worker (Ms  Fatima Abbas) whose day off it was, and ask her to translate the proceedings remotely by mobile telephone to M, who was understandably utterly distraught. When asked in her evidence if she thought it appropriate for such a significant meeting and decision to have been translated to the mother over the telephone, the Guardian Sue Johnson initially conceded "perhaps not" adding that she had not previously understood that the support worker was not present with the parents in the home at the time. Mrs Johnson subsequently went on to agree during cross examination it had been "outrageous" for the Local Authority to have gone ahead with the meeting in the absence of the allocated social worker, an interpreter, the Guardian or the family support worker. I do consider that the Local Authority's handling of the parents has, at times, done little encourage or foster the sense of 'partnership' which they complain is lacking. I am sorry to observe that some aspects of the conduct of this hearing have also added to that impression. I have made certain observations in relation to the service of the Placement proceedings, as well as the failure to serve any update Paediatric evidence in respect of C, and the very late production of looked after child review minutes during the hearing was also unhelpful.

 
With regard to the parents' ability to work in partnership with the family support workers, the evidence which I heard from them broadly supported the parents' case that they had they had a productive and positive working relationship with each of them, save in the last two or three weeks of Shagufta Arif's input during May 2013, when that relationship broke down. 

 
There was a somewhat surprising divergence of opinion between Mrs Hossain and Dr Bashir as to whether the feedback of the family support worker who succeeded Ms Khatun namely Fatima Abbas was supportive or critical of the parents, and she was accordingly called to give evidence for herself about this. In answer to questions on behalf of the Local Authority she indicated that she found that the family proved to be challenging at times, and also that the Mother did not take her advice at times, and agreed when it was put to her, that she had decided to work for another family. In cross examination however she agreed that she had worked with the family from the 16 July until 19th September 2013 and that she stopped work on the day following the looked after child review when she had been asked to interpret by phone, because the family's contact with C was then moved from their home to a contact centre, and so her services were no longer required.

 
Ms Abbas' general observation was that the family had made good progress over the 4 months that she worked with them. She had worked on encouraging them not to carry C so much, and they had allowed her to crawl around which led to her muscles improving. It took time, but on the whole she said they were co-operative.  She said they might disagree on ideas but were able to discuss and resolve these. She firmly refuted having said words to the effect that 'they may not be able to follow advice for the sake of their egos' adding she would never use words like that. She also disagreed that she had criticised M for not dressing her daughter in age appropriate clothes, or that she had remarked on Mother's ability to go through a 'checklist'- another word she said she would not ordinarily use. She added "I'd say the Mother was doing really well". She confirmed the parents were consistent and appropriate in their use of the high chair and playpen, in taking C regularly to the centre, and in following the list of foods provided for her by the dietician. Ms Abbas confirmed that M was also consistent in attending to her daughter's hygiene, and that she would check for signs, and offer appropriate solutions, if her child was distressed. She said she had no concerns that the parents would demur from taking C to a doctor  and expressed her confidence that they would be likely to ensure the child was seen to if needed.  She accompanied M to English classes and to Sure Start and baby weaning classes.  Even if initially uncomprehending of something, she said the parents would come round, and were generally keen to take advice on how best to care for their daughter, and also enquired about other courses they might undertake. Phone calls she said had been a distraction to begin with, but M had learned ultimately that they should only be taken after 4pm.

 
 In the course of the 4 months she referred to having heard one argument between the parents, when they were in one room and she was with S and C in another, and S closed the door. She discerned that each parent was blaming the other for the situation they were in with the care proceedings, and that this was a stressful time for them. She said she did not see any manipulative behaviour, nor did she find them angry or rejecting of her, even though they had their own views. She agreed she had later made a report of the argument to Mrs Hossain on the instruction of Mr Kappan (since the argument had happened after Mrs Hossain's visit). After the argument she noted that M was a bit 'snappy' with her, but she added Punjabi dialects are abrupt, and she saw it as a cultural thing, and did not take it personally. She refuted other comments attributed to her by Ms Hossain such as the parents being "sub cultural normal" (which she said was not a term she would use) and she also denied having described F behaving in a way that might be described as 'consistent with other men of Pakistani heritage'. Ms Abbas observed that the couple had a good relationship and got on well with the wider family. She saw S around the house and she would pop in with her baby Fk who is of similar age to C and the children related happily and played well together. It was also her observation that S and M got on well, whilst S also gave Ms Abbas space to do her work. Ms Abbas also recalled F's other sons and his daughter coming round to the house to celebrate Ede, that an uncle also visited and that F's brother also called to ask about C. This detail contrasts with the Local Authority's concern that there is a lack of practical support from the extended family. True it is that none of them are suitable or able to put themselves forward as alternative carers for C, but in terms of ordinary extended family relationships the evidence indicates these are alive and well, and I am not persuaded that their assistance would be withheld were it to be asked for by F or his wife.

 
Ms Abbas did agree that in early August she had said that she was concerned that F was manipulative towards herself. She said that at the time he was trying to impress her with things he said, but she had not thought he was impulsive just manipulative. Nevertheless She confirmed she had not felt it necessary to complain to the Local Authority about their care of their child since as she put it: 'that was fine'. In acknowledging that F was eager to please and to impress, she added that she could understand why he would strive to keep her on side given the stress of the care proceedings. Nevertheless she said she liked to think her relationship with the parents was consistently good, and confirmed that it was never acrimonious. 

 
One observation made by Ms Abbas which I found particularly insightful came when she described how she would give the parents time to reflect on her suggestions. She said she would put forward an idea and lay out why she thought it was a good one, and then give them time to think about it. As she put it "They are the parents. I am just a family support worker. They reacted how I would expect a good parent to react". It is not difficult to surmise that the element of mutual respect inherent in that approach was likely to have been key to the results which she observed. She said she understood the reservations they were likely to have, given that she came from nowhere into their family, and she tried to treat them with respect. 

 
She also described how both parents would work in shifts with C, with one doing the practical work whilst the other was supervising C, and she made it clear to both of them they should ignore her because as their family support worker she was not there to do childcare, which they understood.

 
 Although her view was that the parents were doing really well and that their care was certainly "good enough" Ms Abbas conceded that it had been "disastrous" on the day when the independent social worker Mrs Hossain came round to see them for the purposes of her addendum assessment. She said "It was like I had stepped into another family home. It was an entirely different day" She expected the parents to have various activities lined up with C, but they simply went to the Child Centre with her. She said she was aware how anxious and worried they were, and that they knew how important it was to have a positive report. There is some consensus that just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong on the occasion of Mrs Hossain's visit. Not only did F spend inordinate periods of time emphatically sharing his complaints about the social worker Mr Kappan with Mrs Hossain, but M chose to take a phone call whilst C was in her stroller, with the result that she did not immediately notice when C's leg became caught in the structure of the stroller. Then when this was noticed, C was hastily lifted from the entanglement by one rather than both arms, which might well have caused her injury, although fortunately it did not.  In contrast Ms Abbas said even on occasions when the parents had ignored her during her work, she had never seen anything which caused her concern for C's safety or wellbeing save on this one occasion when the independent social worker visited, and C's leg was caught in the baby walker.

 
In cross examination Ms Abbas was questioned on behalf of the Guardian about the fact that her uncle is a friend of F's. Ms Abbas acknowledged that she understood that they had been friends for many years adding "I do not know how close they are". She said she became aware that F knew her uncle when she started working with the family, because F had told her that he recognised her. However she said she had not since discussed it with her uncle.  The inference raised was that Ms Abbas may have been suborned into giving more positive evidence on behalf of the family than was warranted on account of this connection. I considered the possibility but rejected it. If it were true I think I think it unlikely that she would have robustly denied that she had made a complaint against the social worker when F alleged that she had, early on in her assignment. She would also have been less likely to have made an early request to change jobs as a result of this, and to have complained to Mr Kappan at that stage about F being 'manipulative'. In the event Ms Abbas said that the Agency had required her to give a week's notice, and then told her to think it over before quitting as they considered her capable in her job. She did so, and said that on reflection she decided to continue working with the family because (as she put it) "there are highs and lows in any job." Overall I found Ms Abbas an honest witness who was striving to be accurate, and (unlike Mrs PA for example) I did not derive the impression that her evidence was driven by any misplaced familial or other loyalty. 

 
In my judgment an element of the difference in feedback obtained by Mrs Hossain and Dr Bashir from Ms Abbas may be explained by the fact that in the months between August and September when each expert respectively undertook their assessment, the improvement which Ms Abbas had observed in the parents care was consolidated. I note also that Mrs Hossain described a direct conversation of 'only a few moments' with Ms Abbas. Ms Abbas was not sure how much longer she spoke with Dr Bashir, but she confirmed that on both occasions the parents had been out of earshot when she did so. Overall she gave a number of examples of the parents' willing responses to her suggestions and how they put them into practice, and she confirmed that she saw a great improvement in M's general confidence between August and September.  

 
Ms Abbas agreed that it had been completely inappropriate for the Local Authority to ask her to communicate to M over the telephone their decision to proceed to adoption, and then to require her to supervise on the following day. Yet she confirmed that the parents nevertheless behaved appropriately towards C. Ms Abbas said she saw no evidence that C was at risk of abuse or neglect by virtue of her parents care, and agreed (when it was put to her) that C would have been safe in their care. I found Ms Abbas' evidence balanced and carefully given. She had the advantage of  being older and possibly more experienced than Shagufta Arif, and she was an articulate and impressive witness. More than any of the professionals in the case she was able to provide the Court with a vivid picture of the day after day experience of observing this mother and father parenting their daughter within their home. That is not to diminish the necessarily more limited observations made by the independent professionals such as the Independent Social Worker, the Guardian and Dr Bashir. Their background knowledge of the files and respective levels of expertise should of course to equip them to discern more over shorter periods. However in taking a balanced view of the conflicting evidence which supports their differing opinions I consider firstly that Ms Abbas' evidence lends more weight to the conclusions that Dr Bashir had reached rather than those of Mrs Hossain. Secondly the views of a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist currently in charge of two multidisciplinary therapeutic centres, as well as a child and adolescent ward in Basildon hospital, cannot simply be dismissed as 'na�ve', as was suggested during the hearing on behalf of the Local Authority and the Guardian.

 
I consider Dr Bashir identified correctly that the parents' level of trust in medical professionals is very different to that which they have in social workers, and that it was substantially after the reunification started that events arose which lead to that mistrust. In September 2013 Dr Bashir proposed that any risk inherent in the damage to the parents' working alliance with professionals could be reduced, and significant progress made towards rehabilitation via one of two working models. Model (a) entailed another assessment over a defined period of 12 sessions with a therapist to support the parents and the Local Authority towards forging a working alliance, with a further prognosis being provided. The other model (b) entailed placing C with her parents with long term monitoring to support them. He opined that if the Court concluded that the risk of harm to C was so significant from this poor working alliance that a return of C to her parents could not be countenanced unless the problem was addressed beforehand, then the assessment model (a) should be preferred. If on the other hand there is a risk but the Court does not consider it is likely to lead to significant harm for C, then a return to her family under longer term supervision under model (b) was to be preferred. As he put it the 1st model stalls the reunification plan whilst the second does not. The second outcome would entail placing C at home under a supervision order. He opined that this would be more productive than a threat which can be disempowering in respect of your child. Asked if C is safe to go home now, Dr Bashir replied that with the safeguards he was suggesting in place, his view is that she is safe, but without those safeguards the risks remain. It was put to him that now after 15months there could be no case for C waiting any longer, and he replied that in his view the whole trajectory was positive in terms of C's growth, development, and attachments with relatives, and that she is temperamentally an easy child. At the parents' level he observed that their commitment remains and their attachment. What was stalling was what they describe as a 'misunderstanding' and which might be termed a 'paranoia' that they are not treated fairly and that their child will be taken from them. The result is that they tread water carefully and the social workers feel they cannot work with them, and they all feel "stuck". He described the issue which arose after the Guardian raised M's possible pregnancy as a "counter-productive dynamic" and expressed the view that it was possible the professionals were forgetting C in all of this, and becoming obstructed by that issue. The whole point he said should be: Can C be safely parented? And: Where might she have the best experience? Here, he said, the long term view is important.

 
To my mind Dr Bashir alone provided compelling professional evidence as to C's emotional developmental needs during this hearing. He urged that it should be born in mind that this child has had regular contact with her parents of never less than twice a week and sometimes five times a week since birth. As a result he observed that she has developed a deep attachment to them. He said that if the hostility between the parents and social work professionals could be reduced, it is a better outcome for C to be with imperfect parents than with perfect adopters, simply because of her attachment to her parents and the love she gets from them. He refuted the suggestion that his opinions were all based on what the parents had told him, clarifying that he had read all the court papers, gained information from the contact supervisors and relatives in addition to the parents, as well as undertaking his own assessment of them as parents with their child. He repeated that it is an important aspect of child welfare to recognise that C is approaching an age of strong identity formation, where the bond of her first year becomes deeper, as do the basics of developing an identity with her family. He conceded that it is likely she will have losses coming to her, whether from loss of her foster parents or her parents, and that this will affect her ability to attach to a new family. He confirmed that he saw nothing over four contact sessions which could be described as detrimental to the child. He said that there was considerable evidence not just from his own observation but from a large body of contact notes that say these parents are able to stimulate C, that they have aspirations for her education, and to provide her with safe care, and he did not consider she would be at risk of abuse.

 
I agree with Dr Bashir that whilst the parents and social workers had a common goal, it could be seen that co-operation levels were high despite the intensive package of interference in their family life, and that continued until a series of events in May led to an engendering of mistrust. Dr Bashir was not moved throughout his cross examination (or within the professionals meeting which he had found to be similar experience) from his view that such risks as exist for C in this case can be managed and reduced. His suggestion of the need for a therapist to assist in this endeavour, is also informed by his expert knowledge of the likely impact upon F's memory and functioning of the frontal lobe surgery which he underwent following his road accident, as well as what he assessed as M's cognitive deficits. He said it is necessary to have regard to their unique presentation and impairments and that lecturing won't work, but helping them reflect and understand through therapy will.

 
I found Dr Bashir's observations compelling and I too reached the conclusion having heard all the evidence, that as Dr Bashir observed, these parents have strengths that can be enhanced, and weaknesses that can be managed. It is important to give weight also to Dr Bashir's professional opinion that now that C's attachment to her family has blossomed, it will be more difficult for her to attach to a new family than to return to her own, and that there are greater risks to her welfare inherent in closing the door to her family through adoption. Dr Bashir did not consider that C would necessarily need social work involvement or assistance throughout her life given her intellectual level, although he did not rule the possibility out.

 
I have given very careful consideration to the views expressed by Sue Johnson the Guardian whom I recognise is an experienced and committed Social worker herself. In the end I have not been persuaded by her view, predominantly because I consider it right to accord greater weight to Dr Bashir in his assessment of all C's needs, and her parents' capacity to provide for them. However there were also some instances where Mrs Johnson's critical observations of the parents handling of their daughter was in some contrast to the observation of contact supervisors who were observing the same presentation. An example was a game of 'peek-a-boo' which she observed F playing with his daughter using his wife's scarf to cover C's face. Whilst her impression was that this was 'deeply distressing' to C, the observation of the support worker (as contained in her contemporaneous note) was that both father and child were laughing at the game. In relation to C's dietary needs Mrs Johnson was reliant on the matters which Mrs Hossain raised in her report, and she was unaware that C had in fact been discharged from the dietician's care by the time of this hearing.

 
Whilst I do not accept that Mrs Johnson is a Guardian minded to just go along with the Local Authority without forming her own views, I do think in this case her views were very significantly coloured by the vexation and outrage which she felt as a result of the parents falsely accusing her of directing the support worker to examine M's belly for pregnancy, thereby impugning her professional integrity. It was clear to me from her evidence that these sentiments had been exacerbated by the GPs letter in so far as it appeared to lend any credibility to the story, although the doctor had observed that the information he had been given was uncorroborated. My view is that the Guardian gave disproportionate weight to those events in assessing the risk that the parents' untruth might present for C in their ability to meet her future  needs. My conclusion in  that regard is supported by the fact that in her position statement filed on the 8th August 2013, the Guardian provided some indication that had mind had been conclusively made up, stating that "The Guardian supports the proposed reduction in contact since it appears the Local Authority are no longer proposing that C remain in her family" and that " sadly the parents have not been able to maintain any sustained period of commitment thus leading the Guardian to agree with the Local Authority that time has run out and that alternative plans for C must now be made"  Crucially, neither she nor the Local Authority had then received either of the addendum reports from the two instructed experts in the case, which were not completed until 19th August and 27th September respectively. It follows that her decision and theirs had then crystallised without the benefit of properly analysing the content of either assessment.

 
 I agree with Miss James' observation in her submissions on behalf of the Mother that in some ways Dr Bashir's evidence reflected the principles enunciated in Lord Templeman's judgment in Re K D (A minor) (Ward: termination of access) [1998] 1 AC 806 when he said " the best person to bring up a child is the natural parent. It matters not whether the parents is wise or foolish rich or poor, educated or illiterate, provided the child's moral and physical health are not endangered. Public authorities cannot improve on nature. Public authorities exercise a supervisory role and interfere to rescue a child when the parental tie is broken by abuse or separation. In terms of the English rule the court decides whether and to what extent the welfare of the child requires that the child shall be protected against harm caused by the parent, including harm which could be caused by the resumption of parental care after separation has broken the parental tie".

 
Dr Bashir's evidence encompassed all aspect of the welfare checklist in s1 of the Children Act to which I must have regard in making C's welfare my paramount consideration. In so far as C can be said to have discernable wishes and feelings in the light of her age and understanding, it is reasonable to assume that she would not wish the attachments which she has formed with her parents to be broken. In my judgement her emotional needs include her need for those attachments to be nurtured and preserved, since on the evidence it is now not likely to be easy for her to lose them and forge them elsewhere. Her physical including medical needs have been well rehearsed above, and I am satisfied overall that these parents are capable of safely providing for those needs to a good enough standard, even if there have been occasions when they have been less than perfect in that regard. I bear in mind the likely effect of any change of circumstances for C if her attachment to her parents is to be ended by placement away from her family. These include the harm to her emotional development from the break, as well as the difficulty she may have in forging such attachments elsewhere. What such change of circumstances may practically entail for her, remains as I have indicated earlier in this judgement, an uncertainty. On the other hand there is a significant body of information to indicate that a change to living in her parents'  home would be a change with which she would now be sufficiently familiar that she may be expected to feel settled and relaxed there. C's age, her Muslim heritage, her particular characteristics as an easy child, but one with significant facial deformities and other medical needs, all underscore the importance for her of nurturing the positive support of the parents who love her unconditionally, rather than embarking on the difficult search for others who may be unable to provide what they do. In my judgement the harm which C has been at most risk of suffering relates to the deterioration in her parents relationship with the social work support team that she is likely to need around her to assist with practical provision for her particular needs for some time yet during her childhood. But as indicated I agree with Dr Bashir that this risk is capable of being managed and reduced, in order to enhance the parents' capacity to meet all of C's needs including that one. 

 
In considering the range of powers available to me I do not consider that a care order represents a proportionate or necessary means of achieving that end. This is a case in which the observations of the EHCR in the case YC v UK at page 2012 [55 EHRR 967] are particularly apposite; As detailed in Ms James' final submission the Court emphasised that: " family ties may only be severed  in very exceptional circumstances and �. Everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate to 'rebuild' the family.  It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing'.  

 
I do however consider that there is a risk that C may suffer significant harm in the future if the Local Authority do not play their part in supporting the measures which have been recommended by Dr Bashir as a better means of rebuilding the working alliance. I will make a supervision order in the hope and expectation that a fresh start and chapter can be commenced. Without seeking to criticise Mr Kappan's abilities in general, I do think it is likely to assist if the Local Authority give consideration to whether another person may be better suited to directly working with the family to bridge the existing mistrust and encourage change. I say this because having formed a professional conclusion against rehabilitation, common sense suggests it will be less easy for him to now support it, or (and this is equally important) for the parents to trust that the commitment is there. I consider it important for the Local Authority to reflect upon facilitating the therapeutic support which Dr Bashir has recommended as a means of rebuilding the working alliance between C's social worker, F and M. I would hope that the Authority may be able to liaise with Dr Bashir directly to ensure that the resources employed are appropriately tailored to this family's particular needs, in C's interests. I will ask the Local Authority (after they have had an opportunity to reflect on this lengthy judgement) to file another care plan to accompany this supervision order, outlining the services and resources they will provide in this regard.

 
Finally I consider it will be helpful, since I am not making a care order, if I conclude with some observations with regard to the timetable for returning C to her parents care in a manner which is likely to best suit her needs in all the circumstances. I hope that the parents will both appreciate that after this period of time living with her foster parents, C is also likely to feel some sense of loss in leaving them behind, and that a programme of agreed shared care between the two homes over the next two week period may help to make the transition from living in one home to the other a smoother one for C. I consider that a broadly equal division of days and nights between the two homes would be appropriate for the first eight days, followed by an increasing number of nights being spent in her parental home until it comprises the whole week by the beginning of week three.

THE JUDGE:  This is the final hearing of the Local Authority's applications.  In relation to the child, T, born on 6th February 2009, the Local Authority now propose a residence order to the paternal grandmother.  In relation to the child, H, born on 19th April 2011, the Local Authority pursue their application for care and placement orders.  

 
These two children of the same mother C, have different fathers.  H's father is SE.  He does not have parental responsibility.  It has not been possible to trace him within these proceedings.  T's father is LM, who attended the issues resolution hearing last week and indicated his support for the continuing placement of his child with his parents.  The Local Authority's plan enjoys the support of the children's guardian.  The mother seeks the return of both children to her care.  They were removed in September 2013, H to foster care, T to the grandmother.  The mother is in fact very pleased with the care that T receives with the grandmother.  Understandably, she expresses the preference for the two children to be together in her care, but she speaks not one word of criticism of the grandmother.  The mother is in fact pregnant, expecting her third child in April of this year.  

 
The relevant material has been assembled in a bundle, the contents of which I have read.  I have had oral evidence from the Local Authority's social worker, the mother and the children's guardian.  The Local Authority, of course, bear the burden of proving their case and the requisite standard is the balance of probabilities.  In fact, it is agreed in this case that the threshold is met in the terms of a document in my papers.  For both children then, the issue is what their welfare requires and I shall start with the position of H.  

 
The Local Authority seek to place H for adoption, which is, of course, a draconian outcome of last resort.  Under the 2002 Act, I make H's welfare throughout his life my paramount concern.  The high point of the case is the inevitable application to dispense with parental consent to place him for adoption.  The statutory test is whether the welfare of the child requires (in the sense of demands) that this should take place.  Expressed in different language, I have to be persuaded that adoption is the necessary and proportionate outcome in all the circumstances.

 
The relevant factors can be stated briefly.  The mother can meet the basic needs of her children.  She has no issues as to drink or drugs or mental illness.  Caring for three�young children would, I am sure, be a major challenge but she would be entitled to receive help.  However, the psychological assessment in this case tells us that mother is at the lower end of the borderline range of intelligence.  At E27, we are told that Miss C presents as a very na�ve, trusting and gullible individual who has been vulnerable to men who have offered her no practical, emotional or financial support.  Miss C fully admits that she has been desperate for friendships and her way to secure a relationship has been to have sex with men.  At E32, after listing a number areas of recommended work, the psychological continues:

 
'The timescales will depend on the availability of the recommended work.  The author suggests a matter of months rather than years.  However, it will be her ability to translate the theory this time into practice, which will demonstrate if she were able to change and whether she can develop the risk prediction skills, assertion and confidence to safeguard the children in the future.  Until the work recommended was completed, and there was evidence to suggest she has developed enhanced risk prediction skills, she is likely to continue to be vulnerable to people that present a risk of harm or are willing to use her for sexual purposes.  
The final quotation to which I draw attention is:
'If she did not develop the skills, there is a probability that the children may experience a number of new men in their lives over time.  Given Miss�C's current presentation, the author is not confident that she has the ability to keep the children safe from harm.  However, with the interventions recommended in addition to an increased support network, she may be in a better position.'
Those opinions must be understood alongside the factual background to this case.  In 2010 mother was content to bring T into contact with her Uncle D, a man with serious convictions for sexual offences.  When challenged, she did not believe that he represented a threat.  Eventually, she was persuaded to put distance between T and D and the Local Authority withdrew.  In 2012, mother once more had this time two children living under the same roof as D.  Again when challenged, she could not accept the threat.  Eventually, she was persuaded to participate in the McEwan Project.  She completed that specialist intervention designed to address the salient issue and was able to persuade the authorities that she had learned an appropriate approach.  In August 2013, the mother brought her children into contact with M B and his girlfriend.  M B was due to be tried by the local Crown Court on sexual offences of the most serious order but, once again, mother had difficulty understanding the problem.  

 
The evidence shows that mother has been rather inconsistent on the issue, but there is evidence that she has accepted that she was the recipient of affection herself from Mr�B.  The children have complained against him, H complaining that he was hurt, T complaining of a game capable only of a sexual connotation.  It seems that mother became conscious that the children were returning to her from Mr B and his girlfriend showing injuries and it is clear that she allowed the children out of her care with these individuals.  

 
The only possible conclusion is that mother has to change her approach to the protection of her children.  This needs extensive work.  It is inconceivable that the children could be home with the mother before these pieces of work were concluded and are proved to have been effective.  The case, therefore, must take seriously into account the timescale this entails.  

 
The mother has a particularly unhappy background, suffering bereavement as a child and she has unresolved problems of grief.  There are problems for mother making and retaining satisfactory relationships.  To her credit, she is seeking and engaging with help with these topics but, as the guardian advises me, we are very early on the road.  The fundamental problem is mother's propensity to engage with abusive friends.  Experience shows that she is so anxious to retain these flawed friendships that she is prepared to tolerate on behalf of her children an unacceptable degree of risk.  The proposal with which no one dissents is that mother should benefit again from the kind of specialist input the McEwan Project was designed to provide some twelve or so months ago.  

 
Mother says now that she did not understand the work of the Project.  In the light of the subsequent cognitive assessment from the psychologist, the mother derives a degree of support for that proposition, which is relevant to the proposal that she participate once more.  On close analysis, it is clear that the McEwan Project was not completely lost on the mother first time round.  Clearly, the workers had some appreciation of her limitations.  For example, it is clear that when a questionnaire came to be completed she received assistance from a worker in that task.  The McEwan�Project itself reported back to the Local Authority in positive terms as to the mother's engagement, progress and result and after the course mother engaged with the Local Authority workers who discussed the topics and were persuaded that mother now understood things that she had not understood previously.  Mother's actions since attending the McEwan Project, I am afraid, tell a different story.  

 
It is, of course, unfortunate that those embarking upon the McEwan Project were not equipped with the cognitive assessment and the recommendations that it contains.  However, mother told me candidly from the witness box that she learnt a bit from the course.  Her engagement on the course and subsequently, confirmed to professionals that this was the case.  In the circumstances, my conclusion is that I would be wrong to treat this engagement with the McEwan Project as null and void, to treat the whole exercise as invalid and to disregard it on the basis of unfairness, whatever the consequences.  There was benefit, but mother clearly needs more.  

 
Therefore, repetition is agreed.  In September, this specialist course is available again.  My enquiries reveal that another Local Authority in the Midlands perceived a gap in provision for those in the mother's predicament and set up this specialist course, which fills a gap in provision across a large area of the country.  The Local Authority have the opportunity to buy places for their local residents and this is what the Local�Authority did last year and what the Local Authority are prepared to do again for the mother.  Delay is obviously a major problem in this case and, recognising this, the Local Authority have researched alternatives.  I am told that the NSPCC offer nothing of this kind and the combined experience of the Local Authority workers and lawyers and those representing mother and the children have not been able to identify a readily available alternative source of this essential input.  This means that the plan inevitably involves a twelve-week course for the mother commencing in September.  

 
Unfortunately, even the twelve weeks commencing in September is not the end of the story.  Clearly, the history indicates that mother has been advised many times before in relation to this topic without implementing the advice.  Therefore, the court would insist that there be time after the completion of the course for its lessons to sink in and for there to be assessment of the extent to which mother has been able to implement the change that the course is designed to bring.  In this context, I am readily persuaded that the twelve-month period mentioned by the guardian in evidence is the kind of period that we are facing in this case.  In relation to alternative sources of assistance, I must determine the case on the evidence.  I cannot determine the case on an optimistic pious hope that something might be found on a more attractive timescale.  Of course, mother is entitled to the assistance the state can offer, but in a specialist area of this kind, I am persuaded that no realistic alternative is before me.  

 
H has been in foster care now for five months.  He is soon to attain his third�birthday.  In that context, I am afraid the proposal to adjourn the case for twelve�months is unattractive in the extreme.  There is no certainty that the mother would succeed even at the end of that period.  The evidence before me is that placement at the present time is perceived to be straightforward for young H.  In another twelve months, he will be more deeply enmeshed in his short-term foster placement.  Inevitably, he will be harder to move, harder to settle in an alternative placement and inevitably a candidate for whom it will be more difficult to find appropriate adoptive carers.  

 
Under the checklist, he needs a secure, safe placement.  The risk of harm in the mother's care is self-evident based upon the factual history in recent times.  Of course, he has a good relationship with his mother through the exercise of contact in recent months and through residence in her care before that, but if mother cannot meet his needs, the value of that continuing relationship is limited.  Instead, the new relationships which the child can form with alternative carers who are able to meet his needs is of great significance and a continuing relationship with the mother represents a barrier to the making and cementation of those new relationships.  Adoption, of course, involves the child ceasing to be a member of the biological family, but it carries with it a counterbalancing advantage through full membership of the family who are able to meet his needs.  

 
The realistic options seem to be these: adoption, foster care or adjournment for twelve�months in order to give further consideration to return to mother's care.  Starting with adoption, the disadvantages are obvious.  Placement in the birth family is to be preferred unless overriding requirements of welfare make that impossible.  Adoptions can fail, they can break down and there can be identity issues in the teenage years.  These problems are minimised the younger a placement for adoption can be achieved.  On the other hand, the advantage that adoption can bring is safe, permanent, secure care, free from the risks of harm inherent in mother's recent history.  

 
Foster care carries with it the advantage that the child could maintain a relationship with the birth family, but the disadvantage is in my judgment an overwhelming one, which is the lack of permanence and security for a child of this young age.  It would seem a poor outcome for a child approaching his third birthday to face a future in long-term foster care.  

 
Adjournment to consider return to mother, of course, retains the advantage that family relationships can remain, but the disadvantage is the uncertainty of success, coupled with the very detrimental impact of the twelve-month delay that is entailed.  Welfare is paramount and in my judgment that twelve-month delay for a child not yet 3 years old is too long.  If there could be a certainty of successful progress for the mother, the prospect might be more attractive but with the inherent uncertainty this is not so.  

 
I am driven to the conclusion that nothing else but adoption will do.  The harm involved in repeated exposure by the mother to abusive friends is at a very severe level.  In my judgment, adoption is proportionate to that level of identified risk.  

 
Returning then to the test I must apply under the 2002 Act, it is clear to me that the welfare of the child does require placement for adoption and it does require me to dispense with parental consent to placement for adoption.  Applying the paramountcy principle, I grant the Local Authority the care order.  Before granting a placement order, the Act requires me to consider contact.  The proposal is an entirely conventional one for indirect contact with mother and sibling.  Direct contact, I am afraid, would be detrimental to the finding and success of the proposed adoptive placement.  In those circumstances, it is clear to me that H's welfare throughout his life will be best served by the granting of the placement order sought.

 
I turn finally to T.  For her, the alternatives are placement with grandmother or return to mother.  The very factors to which I have already referred at length mean that it is not possible for a child to be in the mother's care for the foreseeable future.  In T's case, the balance is even clearer in that she has the advantage of remaining in the birth family, she has the advantage of continuing contact with mother, she is safe and, of course, a residence order does not have the permanent legal consequences which adoption would bring.  All the welfare factors drive me to the conclusion that T should be the subject of a residence order in favour of the grandmother.

 
There is an issue concerning contact.  Mother has exercised contact with T twice a week hitherto.  The Local Authority's medium term plan is for contact to be reduced to a monthly frequency.  Mother would like contact to continue preferably every week.  Mother is able to draw attention to the fact that contact is enjoyable for all concerned.  Those issues that there have been have been small and relatively manageable.  However, the important point is that T must now understand for the first time that her permanent future is with the grandmother rather than with the mother.  Residence with grandmother is not new and grandmother played an important part even before September 2013 but since then she has been acting as a temporary carer.  The message now needs to be understood by T that this is a permanent arrangement.  Roots must go down and she must understand what her future entails.  I am persuaded that an important element of this is a significant curtailing of the existing contact. The current contact carries with it expectations of a return to the old regime.  I am afraid this is not the case and reducing contact is justified.  

 
The Local Authority suggested monthly, the guardian was perhaps a little more generous than that, but there was no professional support for contact at the level for which mother contends.  Everybody anticipates that with grandmother in charge there is going to be some flexibility in relation to this contact with extra contact in holiday times and periods of celebration.  The grandmother herself is going to be in the best position to decide what this should be.  What I propose to do is accept the guardian's advice that contact should be not less than monthly, providing the grandmother, therefore, with an argument that she can use in the event of disagreement with the mother, but at the same time inviting grandmother to use her best judgment so far as the contact regime is concerned.

JUDGE VENABLES: 

This is the adjourned final hearing of the application of the London Borough of Enfield for care orders and placement orders relating to three children, namely ME (D.O.B 25.06.09), ML (D.O.B 28.04.11) and MCL (D.O.B 29.10.12).

 

The matter was last before me in December 2013 where I�heard evidence over five days.  This judgment should be read in conjunction with my earlier judgment given on 17th December.  It has been agreed between counsel that I�deal with the balance of matters today by submissions.  

 

Within my earlier judgment I�set out my assessment of the evidence.  However, I�felt unable to undertake an evaluation of the competing options for the children as I�considered that the court needed further information before it could do so.  The information I�considered outstanding was as to:

 

i)	The resources available to support the family if they moved to Redcar.
ii)	Family support to be achieved through a family group conference if practicable.
iii)	Assessment of sibling attachment.
iv)	Re BS analysis of all placement options.

I gave a clear timetable for the work and I�directed the parents to identify the names of family members they sought to look to for support by 23rd December 2013.  The timetable was necessarily tight.  These proceedings had been ongoing for almost 9 months by the time they were first allocated to me.

 

The parents' case was founded on a plan to move to Redcar to be supported by family members.  This plan had first been formulated in June 2013.  Unfortunately, the parents were only able to produce the name of one further family member during the adjournment.  The local authority gave two extensions of time for names of individuals to be produced by the parents so as to enable an effective family group conference to be set up.  

 

Sadly, the parents were unable to produce any other names.  Thus, the local authority, by agreement with the children's guardian and the parents, called a network meeting in place of the family group conference I�had ordered.  The purpose of this meeting was to look at what support the family could provide for the parents.

 

Mrs.�RL and Mrs.�PG were provided with a copy of the judgment given by me on 17th December to enable them to understand the issues for the court.  The note of the network meeting has been produced by the local authority and is contained at p.G44 of my bundle.  

 

During the meeting, the extended family offered the following support:

 

a)	Mrs.�RL (now 73) would move in with the family for at least two years.

b)	Mrs. PG would provide emotional support and parenting advice on the telephone.  She further agreed that she would visit occasionally.

Mrs. JD, the paternal grandmother's friend (aged 55), was unable to attend the network meeting because of work commitments.  It is acknowledged that she can only give support remotely for the family and that support being given principally to the grandmother.  

 

Mrs. PG has some 30 years' experience in children's services.  She has not seen Mr.�AL for 22 years.  The last occasion on which she saw him was at a family funeral.  Mrs.�PG has offered to help the parents make contact with other family members.  I�am told that there is to be a meeting of the wider family on 9th March.  

 

Before the network meeting, Mrs.�PG wrote to the local authority to set out details of the support she could offer and a copy of her email has been provided to the court.  In her email of 15th�January, she says this:

 

"As we have discussed in our previous conversations, I�would like to clarify the precise nature of what I�am prepared to offer AL and his family should the decision be made to return the children to their parents' care and the family move to live in the North of England.

My role would be quite limited in its contribution to the robust and overarching multi-agency protection plans which will be put in place for all of the children.

I would offer some telephone support to Mrs.�RL as well as the occasional face to face meeting with her.  Depending on how the situation develops, I�would probably have some contact with Mr.�AL and his wife when, hopefully, the family's support network starts to be more firmly established."  

The local authority has made extensive enquiries of the Redcar local authority resources.  With my permission, the London Borough of Enfield disclosed the court bundle to Redcar.  The head of children's services referred the matter to the manager within the children's services team who confirmed:-

 

i)	The local authority would conduct their own initial assessment.

ii)	In view of the children's ages, the family would be supervised under the local authority's "early help" scheme which enables families to access support groups and child development groups.  

iii)	A family support worker would be appointed.  The family support worker would not be qualified but would be supported by qualified staff.

iv)	Monthly visits under a supervision order.

v)	Fortnightly visits under a care order.

vi)	There would be no financial support under a supervision order.

vii)	Access to a health visitor.

viii)	Mrs.�CL would be invited to a mental health centre for an initial assessment.

ix)	The local authority has its own community mental health trust.


The London Borough of Enfield obtained a list of housing agencies.  The London Borough of Enfield do not anticipate that housing would be a difficult matter to resolve.


The local authority has also reported on its assessment of sibling attachment in line with the court's direction.  Mr.�Croft and Mrs.�Grover have liaised with CAMHS, with the contact supervisor, with the foster carers and have further observed contact before completing their assessment.

 

The local authority says ME is increasingly showing signs of an emotionally neglected child.  At para.26, p.C152 of my bundle, they say this:

 

"This has been highlighted by the CAMHS worker who states that during sessions carried out with ME, she will show no bond or positive attachment towards her brothers, despite constant encouragement to talk about them or show her affection towards them through play or art activities.  

This is also something that has been highlighted by the foster carer for ME, who states that she does not interact with ML at all within the home.  When encouraged to talk about her brothers and what they did during contact, for instance, she has never once replied.  The carer tries to encourage ME to interact with ML and show him some affection.  However, she reportedly has never shown any level of interest towards him despite being placed together for a year. 

ME is described by her CAMHS worker as a child who is very shut down and closed off, and someone who shows similar characteristics to those of a neglected child.  In the opinion of CAMHS, ME has not had a positive and consistent parental mind available to her in order for her to develop her own identity which results in her acting closed off and being unable to form positive attachments.  This would correlate with the amount of times she has been in and out of care at such a young age.

ME is a child who requires a great deal of one to one work and nurturing from a carer or an adoptive family that will work at her pace and allow her to continue to develop within a stable and permanent placement.  Careful consideration will need to be given to the exact type of care and support she will require in the future, but CAMHS are very committed to working with ME and any potential adoptive family to ensure that when a placement is sought for her, either alone or with her brothers, then it will be the right placement that will allow her to thrive and reach her full potential in all aspects of her life."

As to MCL and ML, their relationship has been impacted by their separation in their foster placements.  They are full siblings.  However, at para.29 of Mr.�Croft's statement, he says this of their relationship:

 

"ML and MCL currently see each other for several hours per week during contact.  It has been noted that, at times, the two boys argue and show little attachment to one another.  It is clear that MCL is jealous of ML in the attention that he gets, often resulting in MCL acting aggressively towards ML and pushing him over, for instance.  

However, it would be fair to say that this level of jealously between two such siblings would be normal and will be heightened by the fact that they not only have to share their parents' affection during contact times but also because they are currently placed in separate placements which has not allowed them the chance to develop a strong attachment to each other."

The local authority's plan for the children remains for  all three children to be placed together in an adoptive placement, but if they cannot be placed together the London Borough of Enfield would look to a separate placement for ME where she would be the youngest child.  

 

ME is delayed in speech and presents as closed down.  The local authority say her level of need will require very sensitive, focused and stable care.  She has been in care three times in her short life.  Firstly, in July 2010, then from May�2011 until February 2012 and since�January�2013 to date.  

 

The boys are more robust than ME but they, too, have been affected by the history of their care.  MCL has been in care from�January�2013 to present, and before that from May 2011 to February 2012.  The local authority has made further enquiries as to the Borough's success in placing sibling groups made up of two or three children.  At p.C154, para.2 of Mr.�Croft's statement he says this:

 

"The local authority thought the court may find it useful to have an idea of placement statistics.  So after further consultation with Enfield's adoption team, we were able to analyse the team's past success rate regarding the placement of sibling groups.  Over the past five years, the team has only managed to place one sibling group of three.  With regard to two siblings, between 2009 and 2010, there was one sibling group of two placed.  In 2010/2011, there were three.  In 2011/2012, there were two.  In 2012/2013, there were three and from 2013 to date, there have been two sibling groups of two placed."

Thus, the local authority's plan is founded on a recognition that the children are unlikely to be placed together, notwithstanding the local authority's primary aim to find an adoptive placement for all three children.  

 

The local authority's BS analysis of placement options does not recommend long term foster care.  The children are very young.  The possibility of the children remaining "looked after" for their minority was not actively pursued by any party.  It is noteworthy that the local authority were unable to obtain a three sibling placement for the children's time in short term foster care.  The local authority remain firmly of the view that long term foster care does not offer the lifetime security that the children require.  

 

The local authority now invites the court to find that the deficits/gaps in the parents' care, as identified at para.60 of the judgment of 17th December, cannot be satisfactorily met by the resources that would be available in Redcar, nor, indeed, by the support of the family.  Thus, when conducting the necessary holistic evaluation of all of the placement options, the local authority say that the only one which meets the welfare needs of the three children is that of adoption.

 

The children's guardian, Ms.�Weekes, readily engaged in the follow-up enquiries set in train by this court.  She travelled to the network meeting in Redcar on 27th�January, but because of problems with the train, she was delayed.  Nonetheless, she managed to speak to Mrs.�PG by telephone. 

 

Ms. Weekes acknowledges that Mrs.�PG has extensive knowledge of child protection services and welfare issues.  She notes that Mrs.�RL senior is prepared to move in with the family for at least two years, that is, until the children are 7, 5 and 4 respectively.

 

Ms. Weekes accepts that there are services within Redcar that are aimed at safeguarding the children and supporting the parents in meeting the children's emotional and physical needs.  However, the guardian, like the local authority, does not feel that the resources and the family support offers sufficient safeguards to protect the welfare of the children.

 

Mrs.�RL is now 73.  She is prepared to be present within the family home for up to two years.  The guardian observes that the physical presence of Mrs.�RL senior does not address the underlying conflict within the parental relationship and its consequences for mother's mental health and the children's care.

 

Ms. Weekes is concerned that Mrs.�RL was not open about Mrs.�CL's psychotic episode in July 2010, and that her loyalty to her son, Mr.�AL, compromises her ability to robustly monitor and protect the three small children with whom I�am concerned.

 

The children's guardian is concerned that the time-limited nature of Mrs.�RL's intensive support will end when the children are still very much in early childhood.  The fundamental issue for the children's guardian remains the parents' insight, motivation and engagement.

 

Ms. Dixon, on behalf of the children's guardian, submits that the package of support proposed and the support offered within the family does not meet the risks identified by the court in December 2013.  The guardian reminds the court that at a very practical level, the parents have persistently refused to release the children's "red books" to enable the children to have their immunisations.  

 

This issue was brought to the attention of the court in September and again in December.  On each occasion the parents offered to surrender the "red books" or to provide copies.  They did not do so.  In consequence, ML is still behind with his immunisations.  

 

The children's guardian further notes that the parents first raised the possibility of moving to Redcar to be with family in July 2013.  In December, Mr.�AL asserted that they had family there who would support them.  Yet, when the court created the opportunity for  a further  family group conference he was unable to  provide the names of family members who would attend such conference  save for the sole name of Mrs.�PG.

 

It would appear that Mrs.�PG is prepared to offer assistance, albeit on a remote basis to the family, but she has not seen Mr.�AL for some 22 years.  Put simply, the children's guardian has no confidence that the wider family and external agencies can meet the identified risks and further has no confidence in the parents' abilities to engage with professionals in a way that would ensure the safeguarding needs of the children can be met.

 

These proceedings have been ongoing since�January�2013.  The children have been in and out of care since May 2011.  ME has been removed from her parents' care on three separate occasions.  Looking at the sibling attachments and the individual profile of the children, the guardian shares the concerns of the local authority as to the presentation of ME.

 

At paras.10-13, in the report prepared for this adjourned hearing the children's guardian says this:

 

"I visited the children at their foster placements on 4th February 2014 and requested and received updating information about ME's progress at school dated 17th February 2014.

ME, during my visit, engaged well with me on a one to one basis to complete her puzzle, and whilst talking about her friends at school.  However, the view expressed by her foster carer is echoed in the letter from her school.  That is that ME is generally very much on the outside of events around her.  She talks about her friends but actually rarely engages with them.  With her brothers, and in particular ML, she does not talk about them and makes little to no effort to engage with them.

The information from CAMHS suggests that ME presents as an emotionally neglected child.  One has to question how much ME's early life experience in the care of her mother at a time when her mother's illnesses were not managed well and her mother was physically and emotionally vulnerable has impacted on ME's early attachment development.

One has to question how much the removal from her mother's care and placement with foster carers has impacted on her attachment development.  One also has to question the impact of parental alcohol misuse and domestic violence on her attachment development.  It will only be through further work with ME that answers will become clearer.  ME needs to be placed within a family setting where she can learn and experience on a consistent basis, that there are people/carers that are emotionally and physically available to her, that she can rely on adults to protect her and to meet her needs whether or not she seeks it out.

When considering the local authority's placement for adoption and her specified needs, I�would argue that ME is likely to benefit from a placement where she is the youngest or only child."

Thus, the guardian argues that the particular needs of ME suggest that she would benefit from placement where she is the youngest or an only child.  As to ML and MCL, the children's guardian highlights the emotional distance between the boys which is, in part, a consequence of their separation in care.  Both  boys are meeting their developmental milestones and there are no major concerns, save that ML is behind in his immunisations because his "red book" has not been available.

 

Mr. AL and Mrs.�CL are both very disappointed that they were unable to provide the names of any other family members who might support them.  Mr.�AL says, as he said to me in December, he had found the whole concept of telling family and friends about his family problems embarrassing and shameful.  Mrs.�Bradley, on behalf of the father, tells me that he has travelled to Redcar five times to try to find family members who might be able to help.  I�am told that the large family gathering set for 9th March has been initiated by Mrs.�PG.

 

Mrs. Bradley tells me that Mrs.�PG has spoken to Mr.�AL and Mrs.�CL about the need for openness and cooperation and, as a consequence, Mr.�AL has a better understanding of what is required of him.  Mr.�AL's latest statement of evidence stresses his regrets about his lack of openness in the past and asks the court to give him and his wife another chance.

 

Counsel for Mrs.�CL has filed a long and detailed position statement which reminds the court of its positive observations about mother's developing insight into the management of her mental health difficulties.  It also reminds the court that mother has maintained abstinence from alcohol since February 2013.  

 

Mr. Ageros further reminds the court  that Mother loves the children very much and asks the court to give the couple a last chance to show that they can work cooperatively with family and with agencies.  

 

In any public law proceedings where the local authority invites the court to make a care or supervision order, s.31(2) of the Children Act 1989 says this:

 
"(2) A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied - 

a)	That the children concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; and

b)	That the harm or likelihood of harm is attributable to � 

i)	The care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him."

In this case, the threshold has been agreed between the parties and there is an agreed statement of threshold contained at p.A73 of my bundle.  That threshold statement records as follows:

 

1)	All parties accept that on 26th�January�2013 (the relevant date) the children were suffering, or likely to suffer, significant harm.  The harm was attributable to the care being given to the children by the parents, not being what it is reasonable to expect a parent to give.

2)	Previous harm  

The children are the subject of supervision orders made on 12th�September�2012 during care proceedings.  Within those proceedings it was accepted that the children had suffered owing to the mother's mental health problems, numerous incidents of domestic violence between the parents, periods of imprisonment in respect of both parents and alcohol misuse.  A copy of the agreed threshold is attached.

3)	Domestic violence  

On 26th�January�2013 at 5 a.m. the mother was arrested by the police following an allegation that she had assaulted the father.  The parents accept that there was an assault with an implement that caused substantial bruising/cuts to Mr.�AL.  The children were present in the home at the time of the attack.

4)	Alcohol misuse/mental health issues

At the time of the assault on 26th�January�2013, the mother was under the influence of alcohol.  Alcohol affects the mother's anti-psychotic medication and is known to make her angry and violent.  Both parents have previously admitted drinking alcohol knowing that this can fuel arguments.  Mother admits to using alcohol as a mechanism with stress.

5)	 Non-cooperation with child protection services

The parents have a distrustful and volatile relationship with social services.  They did not cooperate fully with the arrangements for monitoring and support of their care of the children under the supervision order. 
 
6)	Neglect

On attending the family home on 26th�January�2013, the police found the home environment to be extremely untidy with brandy and flour on the floor as a result of the incident.

In my judgment of 17th December 2013, I�went on to make the following findings:

 

i)	The societal, medical and emotional pressures on the parents have been enormous.

ii)	Mrs.�CL has remained abstinent from alcohol from February 2013.

iii)	Mrs.�CL engaged with services in an attempt to address her maladaptive use of alcohol.

iv)	There is no evidence that mother is not currently compliant with the psychiatric services and, in particular, with regard to her medication.
v)	She has a developing insight into difficulties within the relationship.

vi)	She has an enduring psychiatric condition in the form of paranoid schizophrenia.

vii)	Mr. AL has continued to have difficult and challenging relationships with professionals within these proceedings as he  did during the currency of the earlier Supervision Order. 

viii)	Mr. AL uses complaints against professionals as a defence mechanism.

ix)	Mr. AL has no or limited insight as to the impact of domestic conflict on mother's mental health.

x)	Mr. AL  failed to engage in any meaningful work with Mr.�Clark or the Moorfield Centre around the underlying cause of marital conflict.

xi)	Mr. AL is challenged by the competing vulnerability of his wife and his children, and has repeatedly failed to prioritise the children's emotional and physical safety as demonstrated  in�January�2013.

xii)	During Mrs.�CL's psychiatric episodes, the children have been exposed to episodes of explosive violence.

xiii)	Mrs.�RL's principal concern is for her son and that she did not report events of July 2010 to social services.  In consequence, the court must be extremely cautious about her ability to work transparently with the agencies.

ME, ML and MCL are all very much loved by their parents.  Mrs.�CL and Mr.�AL have continued to attend contact regularly since this matter was last in court.

 

ME, ML and MCL have been the subject of proceedings for most of their lives.  ME has been in care three times, MCL and ML for almost the whole of their lives.  A decision must be made for the children without further delay.

 

Counsel for mother and father each invite the court to make an "in principle" decision that the children should be returned to the parent's care, but for the proceedings to be adjourned to enable the relevant authorities to be invited to prepare a support package.  Such submissions tacitly acknowledge that the court has as much evidence as is necessary as to the support the family can offer.  

 

No application for an adjournment is made to enable any further enquiries to be pursued within the family.  Indeed, the court would be bound to reject such an application in any event, since the court first invited the parents to provide names of family members who could support/be assessed back in May 2013.

 

Mr. AL and Mrs.�CL are in the very early stages of  establishing/renewing  relationships with the paternal family.  Mr.�AL has not seen Mrs.�PG for 22 years.  He last had contact with other significant members of the family, with whom he hopes to meet on 9th March, some 38 years ago.  

 

The course of his relationships with family members if renewed, and the strengths of the individuals and the robustness of the relationships cannot begin to be assessed within the children's timescales.  I�must therefore focus on what is currently available to the family.

 

The Court of Appeal has given guidance to the family court in a series of recent authorities which confirm the need for the court to ensure that a proper and effective evaluation is undertaken of all the realistic options at the welfare hearing.  

 

Recent case law

In Re W [2013] EWCA Civ.1227, Ryder LJ said at para.76:

 

"The welfare evaluation and the question of what, if any, orders are to be made, engages Article 8 of the Convention and the proportionality of that intervention must be justified.  One cannot have a clearer description of the imperative than that contained in the Supreme Court's judgments in the matter of Re B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33.  A court cannot apply the yardstick of proportionality in its consideration of what is necessary without having evidence about the options to which it can apply a welfare evaluation.  As McFarlane LJ said in Re G at [54]:

'What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options.'"

This authority served to remind the court that it should adopt the least interventionist approach consistent with the child's welfare.

 

In Re BS (Children) EWCA Civ.1146, the Court of Appeal said this;
"22. The language used in Re B is striking.  Different words and phrases are used, but the message is clear.  Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are 'a very extreme thing, a last resort', only to be made where 'nothing else will do', where 'no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interests', they are 'the most extreme option', a 'last resort � when all else fails', to be made 'only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short, where nothing else will do'. See Re B paras.74, 76, 77, 82, 104, 130, 135, 145, 198, 215.

23. Behind all this there lies the well-established principle, derived from s.1(5) of the 1989 Act, read in conjunction with s.1(3)(g), and now similarly embodied in s.1(6) of the 2002 Act, that the court should adopt the 'least interventionist' approach.  As Hale LJ (as she then was) said in Re O (Care or Supervision Order) [1996] 2 FLR 755, 760:

'The court should begin with a preference for the least interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach.  This should be considered to be in the better interests of the children� unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary.'

25. Implicit in all this are three important points emphasised by Lord�Neuberger in Re B.

26. First (Re B, paras.77, 104), although the child's interest in an adoption case are paramount, the court must never lose sight of the fact that those interests include being brought up by the natural family, ideally by the natural parents, or at least one of them, unless the overriding requirements of the child's welfare make that not possible."

The threshold having been agreed in this case, the court must now look at the options for the future of these three small children.  In order to complete that evaluation in the context of applications for both care orders and placement orders, the court must consider the provisions of the Children Act s.1 and s.1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.

 

Under s.1 of the Children Act, the welfare of each child is paramount in the court's consideration of the upbringing of that child.  In this case, the parts of s.1(3) of the welfare checklist which I�consider to have particular relevance  for the three children are:

 

Section 1 The Children Act

(a)	The ascertainable wishes and feelings of the children concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding)

The children are all very young and therefore unable to provide an articulate expression of their wishes, but it is apparent that the children, by and large, enjoy seeing their parents.  The children have been in care for such a long time that it has had an impact on the relationship between the boys and ME.  ME, whilst settled, has been noted to be shut down.  This has impacted on her relationship with the two boys from whom she appears detached.  ML and MCL have a distant relationship but one which is capable of improvement with effective social work.

 

(b)	His physical, emotional and educational needs

ML and MCL are meeting their developmental milestones but ME is delayed in her speech and social interaction.  She presents as a neglected child in that she is closed down and has difficulty in establishing attachments.  The level of her difficulty will require consistent monitoring and professional input.  Her primary need is for stability and security with carers who are physically and emotionally available to her.  The children's guardian considers that she should ideally be parented as the youngest in a placement or as an only child.  

 

(c)	The likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances 

Any change of circumstances will be unsettling.  The boys have a distant relationship and work will need to be done to repair that.  Both boys appear to be meeting their developmental milestones.  ME's exposure to her early life in her mother's sole care at a time when her mother was vulnerable both physically and emotionally, coupled with the repeated moves into care, has left her emotionally fragile.  

 

Whilst ME may appear to cope with change on a superficial basis, it is likely that any further changes in the arrangements for her care are likely to have a significant impact on her psychological development.  She needs security, stability and consistency.  She is unlikely to manage multiple changes in care arrangements.  She is furthermore likely to require ongoing support from CAMHS. 

 

(d)	 His age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant

ME is Nigerian and Malawian.  She has a unique heritage within the family.  Her ongoing developmental delay will need to be supported through professional input and enhanced primary care.  ML and MCL are both Malawian/white British.  Their cultural and developmental needs coupled with their ages suggest that it would be difficult for there to be an exact cultural match outside of the family.  

 

(e)	 Any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering

ME continues to demonstrate features of emotional neglect which are likely to continue throughout her life, but may be ameliorated by stability and security and ongoing professional input.  

 

(f)	How capable each of his parents, and any other parent in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs

Mrs.�CL has an enduring mental illness which is currently managed.  Historically, she has experienced psychotic episodes when non-compliant with medication.  Dr. Ratnum, when reporting in April 2013, said her mental health will impact on her day to day functioning when she experiences a relapse as:

 

a)	At times when she is experiencing psychotic thoughts, her ability to meet the needs of the children would be impacted due to preoccupation with her symptoms;

b)	If depressed, she would be remote;

c)	If intoxicated, the children will be exposed to explosive situations;

d)	She needs to remain compliant with her medication for the foreseeable future;

e)	Mrs.�CL understood her diagnosis and was able to identify symptoms;

f)	Mrs.�CL had a history of non-compliance but this was linked to her mental health.

Thus, it is probable that irrespective of mother's maladaptive use of alcohol, there will be periods when she is unwell.  Mr.� AL does not act as a protective factor as he has historically been unable to prioritise the needs of the children over the needs of their mother.  Very sadly, his current acknowledgement of previous failings and his commitment to work differently in the future comes at a time when that wish to change falls outside of the children's timescales.

 

The local authority and the children's guardian have made the enquiries I�directed to see whether other resources can be put in place to ensure the children can be safeguarded in the care of their parents.  Mrs.�RL's offer to move in at 73 is a time-limited support.  Mrs.�RL loves her son, he is her priority.  She has struggled to prioritise the children as was evident when she did not share her account of the events of July 2010 during the viability assessment.

 

Mrs.�RL is developing a relationship with her daughter-in-law but her presence in a family home with the parents and the children, cannot and does not offer the fundamental protection required to address the problems within the parental relationship.  Mrs.�RL is no longer young.  She offers two years of her time and that takes the children only a little further into their childhood.

 

The distant support offered by Mrs.�PG and Ms.�JD to the parental grandmother is not enough to address the risk factors within the family even if external agencies are brought in, because, very sadly, the court cannot be confident of the level of the parents' engagement in light of the events of the last three years.

 

Turning now to the relevant provisions of the Adoption and Children Act, it is significant that the court is required to consider the child's welfare throughout their life, rather than just to the end of their minority.  The relevant sections of the checklist under s.1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 are as follows:

 

Sections (a), (b), (d) and (e) have been addressed by me above but the balance of the checklist that requires further examination is as follows:

(c) The likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become and adopted person

The consequences for the three children will be very significant if they cease to be members of the family.  The children each have a unique heritage which is significant for their personal identity, social and educational development.  The court is bound to recognise that the children's family makeup is unlikely to be replicated outside the birth family.  For ME, this is likely to be a particular challenge in view of her current presentation.  

 

The local authority's analysis makes clear that whilst the local authority will look for a placement for all three children on an adoptive basis, it is unlikely to be successful.  I�note the children's guardian's view as to ME requiring a separate placement, and on the local authority's case that that is the likely outcome if the efforts to find a placement for all three children together proves unsuccessful.

 

Thus, my consideration of the placement options for the children is made  on the basis that it is unlikely all three children will be placed together if they are  not returned to the family.

 

(f) the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, including:-

(i) the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so.

The children have a close relationship with their mother and father.  They have not had the opportunity of establishing a meaningful relationship with their grandmother as their opportunities to meet her have been limited.  

 

(ii) the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the children's needs. 

There is no one else who offers themselves as carers within the family.

 

(5) In placing the child for adoption, the adoption agency must give due consideration to the child's religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background.

The children have important dual heritage.  They have not been in the care of their mother and father for long enough to establish an understanding of the underlying cultural values of those cultures, and it is important that they are given the opportunity to gain that understanding.

 

Thus, looking at the placement options through the prism of the welfare checklists of the Children Act and the Adoption and Children Act, I�consider the realistic placement options are:

 

Placement with mother and father supported by Mrs.�RL, Mrs.�PG and Mrs.�JD with a support package from Derbyshire

A family placement is the placement of choice provided it is consistent with the children's welfare.  There is no doubt the children are well loved by both mother and father, and that they are very keen to care for them.  It is likely that this is the only placement where the children could all be together and where the children's cultural needs will be met. The paternal grandmother wishes to be involved in the children's lives. The children have half siblings through the Fathers first marriage. It has not been possible for those relationships to flourish because of the strained relationships within the Fathers first family and the fact the children have been in care for most of their lives. 

 
Within these proceedings the children have been out of the family for 14 months .  The children have lived most of their lives in care.  ME is going to need high quality consistent care in view of her delay and emotional vulnerability.  The disconnect between her and her siblings and the friction between the boys will need external support.  

 

The re-introduction of the three children to a household where the parents have been unable to address  underlying difficulties within their relationship increases  the risk of  parental conflict, and the consequential risk to Mrs.�CL's mental health.

 

Mr. AL has been unable to demonstrate that he can prioritise the needs of the children and to act protectively.  The support proposed by Mrs.�RL,  and the agencies is time-limited, untested and does not address the fundamental issue as to the father's lack of insight and his persistent failure to prioritise the children's needs. The children need plans to be made for their future lives. They cannot wait any longer for their parents to demonstrate change when they have been unable to do in the 3 years since May 2011.

 

	Adoption 

It has been clear to me from the outset of this final hearing that the local authority's plan is likely to result in the separation of the children.  The local authority has only been able to place one sibling group  of three in the last five years. Thus, when the children's heritage, their ages and the delay and detachment noted in ME, is taken into account, I�consider it highly unlikely that the local authority will find a cultural match for all three of the children together.  The court directed the local authority to pursue its further enquiries of support options for the family to ensure all possibilities had been properly examined.

 

Adoptions do not always succeed.  There is conflicting evidence as to the success rate of adoption but the recent BAAF report of Saunders and Selwyn  of 2011 suggests that siblings groups in placements lasting more than 12 months have an enhanced chance of success.  

 

All three of the children with whom I�am concerned need an end to the uncertainty in the arrangements for their care.  They need to know who their primary care givers will be, both now and into the future.  The local authority do not consider long term foster as an option for the children in view of their ages.  Indeed, that is not an option that has been pushed by either mother or father.  

 

Long term fostering may or may not enable the children to be placed together.  However, the difficulties the local authority have had in placing the children together on a short term basis would suggest that placing the three children together on a long term basis will be equally challenging and in my view unlikely. 

 


The question of the relative merits of adoption and long term fostering have been examined most recently in the case of Re V (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ.913.  The Court of Appeal held that fostering could not be equated with the security of adoption.  The material differences between the two types of placement were articulated and placement orders were made on appeal.  

 

The court in Re V reiterated the need for the court to ensure that it makes the least interventionist order required to meet the children's welfare needs.  The court went on to identify material differences between fostering and adoption whilst making clear that each case should be considered on its facts.

 

The principal differences noted were:-

 

a)	Adoption ensures a child is a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he or she will belong.  To the child it is likely they will feel different to when they are fostered.  The commitment of the adoptive family is of a different nature to that of a local authority foster carer whose circumstances may change however devoted he or she is, and who is free to determine the caring arrangements.  ME is a child who requires certainty and security in the care arrangements for the whole of her life.  The Guardians analysis suggests she will require significant remedial work supported by committed and supported lifetime carers. The boys relationship needs to be nurtured and supported in a robust and committed forever family.

b)	Parents may apply for a discharge of a care order with a view to getting the child back to live with them, whilst an adoption order is made for ever. These three children have been in and our of care throughout their lives. It is essential that the uncertainty in the arrangements for their care is brought to an end.

c)	Contact in the context of adoption is different to that in the context of a fostering arrangement.  The local authority is obliged to allow contact in the context of long term fostering .  The contact position can be regulated by alternative orders, but the situation is still in marked contrast to that of an adoptive child.  

Open adoptions are unusual.  There are open adoptions where parents see the child but it would be fair to say that generally, contact only happens in the context of an adoption where there is full agreement.  Once the adoptive order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.

d)	The local authority no longer has a role in the life of an adoptive child which means the child escapes from the ongoing administrative burden of reviews, meetings and consultations. ME, ML and MCL are still very young. It would not be appropriate for these three children to be burdened with the administrative demands of a fostering arrangement throughout the rest of their minority when weighed against the limited benefits of long term fostering for them.

Adoption offers permanency but at the cost of an ongoing connection with the birth family, and whereas here the siblings are likely to be separated, there is a further disconnect between the child and their family of origin.

 

I remind myself that the parents' and the children's Article 8 rights are engaged and that the court can only interfere with the family's right to respect for private and family life if it is proportionate to do so.  The court must make the least interventionist order consistent with the children's welfare needs.

 

I have considered this case very carefully.  I have weighed in the balance the inherent positives and negatives of a supported placement within the family and  adoption as set out above.   I am very alive to the   likelihood of the children being separated. Very sadly, I�am compelled to find that the only arrangement for the children which is consistent with their welfare needs is adoption. The local authority supported by the children's guardian invite the court to endorse a programme of reduced contact with contact reduced to letter box contact twice a year. 

 
 The challenge of finding adoptive placements for the children leads me to the view that the court should not fetter or anticipate the prospective adopter's attitude to face to face contact. To do so would be inappropriate as it may result in further reducing the pool of carers who would make themselves available for all or some of the children. As a consequence I approve their plan for the reduction of contact.

 

Thus, I�make care orders to the London Borough of Enfield in respect of all three children on the basis of their plan to seek an adoptive placement for the three children together. In the event that the local authority cannot find a suitable placement for the children together the local authority will go on to seek a placement for ME where she is the only or youngest child and the two boys will be placed together. In the event the children have to be placed in separate placements the local authority will seek to secure regular sibling contact. 

 

I further go on to make placement orders dispensing with the consent of each parent on the basis that the children's welfare requires me to dispense with their consent in order for the plan for permanence to be implemented. I have considered s52 of the Adoption and Children Act in reaching this decision and conclude that such  orders are necessary for and consistent with the children's welfare, not simply through their minority but throughout the whole of their lives.

The proceedings
	These proceedings concern two children who I shall refer to as S and T. S is a little girl born on [a date in] 2009, now aged 4 � years. T was born on [a date in] 2011 and is just 3 years old.  The applications before the court are for care orders and placement orders in relation to both children.  This is the final hearing.

 
The parties 
	The applications are made by Wiltshire Council (LA) in whose area the children reside. The children's mother is (M).  She is currently in a relationship with (F) who is T's father.  DNA testing carried out in 2012 established that S's father is (AB). He does not share parental responsibility for S.  Numerous attempts have been made by the LA to make contact with him in relation to these proceedings, but he has failed to respond to all communications and it has not been possible to serve him with the required formal notice.  In view of his failure to engage in previous proceedings or to take steps to be involved in S's life since his paternity was confirmed, I have directed that the LA need not continue to try to serve him.  F does not share parental responsibility for S, but in view of the 'parenting' role he had adopted in relation to her, I consider it appropriate that I refer to him as a parent.  The children are represented through their Childrens Guardian, Jerry Hawkins (CG).

 
Background
	The children were previously the subject of care proceedings commenced in 2011.  The LA was concerned about injuries to S in the form of bruising and a torn frenulum. Both children were removed to foster care and placed with (H), agency foster carers, where they remained for nearly 2 years while investigation into the cause of S's injuries continued. In September 2012, the LA concluded that the expert evidence commissioned to assist the court was insufficient to support the threshold findings.  Blood testing had identified the presence of a transient lupus anticoagulant, possibly related to a viral infection, which the jointly instructed experts agreed was the most likely cause of the extensive bruising to S.  In May 2012 when S was tested, no abnormalities in her blood clotting were detected, although it is not clear that S was specifically retested for the lupus anticoagulant at this time.  Dr Debelle, consultant paediatrician, reconsidered his advice and concluded that the torn frenulum could well be an accidental injury, S being a toddler with an unsteady gait. 

 
	In the course of the proceedings, the LA had become concerned about the basic parenting skills of both M and F, who appeared to need a high level of advice and guidance.  The sought to amend its threshold statement to reflect these concerns, citing developmental delay identified when the children first came into care.  S and T were observed to have thrived while in foster care.  Dr Debelle was asked to consider this issue and reported in August 2012.  He concluded that there was some evidence of developmental 'catch up' in S's case since she had been in care.  In addition, he raised concerns about S's behaviour in contact visits over a number of months, which he thought might indicate possible attachment issues indicative of parental neglect.  He did not feel able to give a definitive opinion on this matter which would need to be sought from a child psychologist.

 
	A revised threshold finding based on developmental delay was not accepted by the parents and was to be the subject of further legal argument.  But in the meantime, the LA had indicated to the court that in any event it intended to embark on a programme of rehabilitation of the children back to the parents' care, with extensive work and support to be provided that would take into account the concerns identified and the parents' individual learning needs. The proceedings were further adjourned to allow this plan to be implemented, and several extensions made to the timetable to allow the plan to be taken at a pace appropriate to the children's needs.  The LA informed the court that the parents "had made significant progress in building confidence, understanding and ability to parent the children" and S and T returned home on 26 March 2013.  

 
	In April 2013, the proceedings were finalised by permission being granted to the local authority to withdraw the case.  The LA would continue to support and monitor the family without the need for orders, and had no concerns about the parents' willingness and ability to work with them.  It was not felt necessary for the court to consider or make any findings on the matters contained in the LA's threshold statements in the light of the progress made.  This step was agreed by all parties, including the CG at that time, Sylvie Reeve.  

 
	Various agencies continued to be involved with the family, including  the health visitor and social worker, and Mrs Penny visited twice weekly from the Intervention Service.  S and T were attending nursery and M's mother (MGM) was helping out.  The records suggest that, overall, this period was positive, although T appeared to manage the transition more easily than S.  In particular, it was recognised that as the children had been in foster care for almost two years, support was needed in relation to behavioural management and putting routines in place.  After a few weeks, the social worker, Miss Tubbs, was concerned that F was often unavailable, still in bed, when a number of social work visits took place, and that M was being left to manage the children on her own.  

 
Precipitating events  
	On Tuesday 28 May 2013 when Mrs Penny visited she was informed that S had been unwell at the weekend. Mrs Penny describes S as "whimpering" when she arrived, although she had brightened during the visit. S was reported to have been sick on Saturday evening, following which M and F had noticed bruising on S's face and were concerned it might be a repeat of the lupus problem. In further discussion, the parents described how S would get out of her bed at night and try to climb into T's cot, getting herself caught in the bars and hurting/bruising her legs.  Having observed the bruising to S's face, Mrs Penny advised the parents that they should take the child to see her GP and assisted in making the appointment.  When she revisited two days later she was told by the parents that the GP, Dr Pemsel, had said the bruising to the face was as a result of the vomiting and the bruising to the body and legs was consistent with play, including getting her legs caught trying to climb into the cot. The LA contacted Dr Pemsel who confirmed that she had accepted the parents' explanations.  The parents agreed to the LA's request that S be seen by a paediatrician at Salisbury district hospital.

 
	S was seen by Dr Lwin on 1 June 2013. He was very concerned about what he described as extensive bruising. He prepared a report in which he concluded that while some of the bruises were likely to be accidental, there were concerns in respect of the bruises on S's face and around her knee and he recommended further investigation.  S was admitted for further tests to be done. Blood tests for abnormal clotting were negative, but did not include a repeat of the earlier test for the lupus inhibitor.  After the intervention of the LA, this was later carried out and no inhibitor identified as being present.

 
	S and T were made subject of police protection orders and immediately returned to the care of H. Photographs of the bruising were not taken until 2 June 2013 when they were recorded by a police photographer.  It appears that the hospital was unable to facilitate making such a record over a weekend.

 
	M and F were arrested and interviewed by Wiltshire police on 2 June 2013 and subsequently charged with criminal offences which the CPS has indicated will be discontinued at a hearing later this month on the basis that there is insufficient evidence to support a prosecution.  

 
	The children remain in the placement with H.  Not surprisingly their experience of being removed for a second time has had a major impact on them.  Observations by H and Miss Thomas, the social worker, suggest both children have struggled to understand what has happened to them and are at times bewildered and confused. S initially presented as very insecure and controlling, at times defiant and aggressive.  Over the last few months her behaviour has stabilised but she continues to require a lot of reassurance, as does T who has become insecure and clingy and finds it difficult to be out of the foster home.  

 
	Following the commencement of these proceedings, the parents' relationship has been under pressure, and an incident took place on 19 July 2013 between F and M, during which F kicked M on the leg and punched her to arm.  M was very distressed when describing the incident to Miss Thomas.  M confirmed that nothing like that had happened previously, although she is reported to have said F was verbally abusive and controlling towards her.  In their statements both parents suggest the police were called to the incident, but it appears no formal complaint was ever made although M had told Miss Thomas she would do so with the support of MGM.   

 
The LA's case 
	It is the LA's case, as set out in their threshold document filed in these proceedings, that S has sustained bruising to her face, body and legs some of which may be attributable to active childhood play, but bruising to the face and the right knee are more likely to be inflicted than accidental. The court is asked to make a finding that some or all of the injuries were caused by M or F, or both of them, either by way of direct or deliberate force or by way of neglect. The LA further relies upon the children's presentation and an assessment by Dr Richer, jointly instructed child psychologist, to support a finding that both S and T have suffered significant emotional harm whilst in the care of their parents between 26 March 2013 and 1 June 2013, and as a result of neglectful or abusive parenting in the care of their parents before they were removed in June 2011. 

 
	I am not asked to make findings in relation to the injuries first raised in the 2011 proceedings which it was not thought necessary or proportionate to determine at the tine the LA sought permission to withdraw the proceedings.  To do so would have significantly extended the time estimate for this hearing and introduced yet more delay.  I am satisfied that it remains not necessary or proportionate.

 
	The LA asks the court to find that threshold is now met in relation to both these children, and that sadly the evidence points to these parents being unable to meet the children's needs and that they should be found an alternative family placement. The LA seeks care orders, the care plan being permanency by way adoption for both children.  Application has also been made for placement orders to be immediately considered if the care plan is approved.

 
	At the outset of the proceedings, it was not clear whether the current foster carers would be in a position to adopt the children.  That issue has now resolved and the LA has amended its care plan adding the following:  The LA placement plan is for the children to remain placed with H who will be applying to adopt the children. The LA supports their application and has reached a financial agreement which has enabled H to put themselves forward as adopters.

 
The parents' case
	In the earlier proceedings, M was assessed as lacking capacity, but a further assessment by Dr North carried out in relation to these proceedings concluded that M does have capacity and she has been able to give her own instructions to her legal representatives.  I note that her full-scale IQ of 65 places her in the  mild learning disability range for IQ.  Although F does not meet the criteria for learning disability, his IQ scores were borderline, and he is said to have very poor social and communication skills and avoids social interaction. The difficulties M has with cognitive functioning and the support both parents needed was recognised within the previous proceedings and taken into account by the LA when working with M and F.  

 
	The parents do not accept that S's injuries are anything other than accidental, caused by normal childhood play of an active 4 year old.  Further, the relevant date is of considerable importance.  As at date of removal in June 2013, it is their case that there is no evidence that their care of the children was deficient or of any real problems following return of the children to their care. The rehabilitation programme was going as expected and had it not been for the bruises, would not have been brought to an end.  The behaviours displayed by the children after this second removal are more likely to be attributable to this confusing and damaging experience than to the short period spent in the care of their parents.  

 
	The incident that occurred between the parents in July 2013 took place after the children were removed and was an isolated incident at a time of stress.  There is no evidence of any other such incidents.  It is accepted that in 2011there were arguments between them, but there is no evidence of that continuing since that time up until the children were removed.

 
	It is therefore submitted that the threshold test is not met, and that the children should be returned home.  Even if the court does find threshold met, the parents rely on the progress made under the plan and ask the court to consider returning the children to them, or to the MGM.  If that is not possible, they fully support S and T remaining with H and are pleased that the LA has indicated that it does not intend to move the children and that H will be making an application to adopt them.  

 
The CG's position
	The CG leaves it to the court to determine the facts with regard to the injuries.  The CG agrees with and adopts the evidence of Dr Richer that a move from their current placement for the children would be harmful and not in their best interests.  For these reasons, he has been unable to firmly support the LA application until it became clear that H would be applying to adopt the children.   

 
The evidence 
	I start by setting out the evidence relied upon to support the findings set out in the LA's threshold statement.  I shall deal firstly with the medical evidence.  The hospital notes containing the observations and recordings made by the treating physicians are available in the court bundle, together with reports from the court appointed experts, Dr Ward and Dr Leisner.  It was only necessary to hear oral evidence from Dr Ward, a consultant paediatrician appointed to provide expert opinion on the issue of S's bruising.  She provided a written report in September 2013 which contains a review of the medical evidence.  At the time of reporting the quality of the photographs provided was poor. Descriptions and body maps completed by treating physicians were available within the hospital records and Dr Ward made it clear that her discussion of the bruising was based on those descriptions and maps as well as the photographs she was confident enough to interpret.  'First copy glossy photographs' were made available when she gave her oral evidence.  

 
	Dr Ward referred to the research literature in relation to bruising, noting that it is no longer considered reliable to predict likely age of bruises from their colour, which she had therefore not attempted.  Likely timing of bruising will therefore have to be determined in so far as it can from what accounts there may be of who saw what, and when.   She referred to two common characteristics separating abusive from non abusive bruises; location and pattern.  She noted that S's age and development was such that she was likely to sustain some accidental bruising as a result of her daily activities and play.  Taking a holistic view, Dr Ward observed that S had more bruises than one would expect for an active child of her age.  The bruises to the forehead, forearms, left hip, back and shins could have been sustained as a result of active play.  However, bruises to both cheeks were unexplained and not consistent with bruising due to increased venous pressure in the course of retching and vomiting.  S also had extensive bruising on the lateral and medial aspects around over and under the right knee joint.  She noted that no plausible explanation for these injuries was offered, indeed she commented on the fact that for a number of these injuries the parents seemed to be unable to give an account of the circumstances in which they occurred which might be expected if S was being properly supervised. She concluded on a balance of probability that these bruises were non-accidental in origin.  The likely mechanism for both the facial bruising and the bruising around the right knee was forceful gripping or grasping by an adult.  On these issues she maintained her opinion in cross-examination.    

 
	Having had an opportunity to consider the rather better copies of the photographs, Dr Ward amended her opinion in relation to the bruising on S's forearms.  She was concerned that the pictures showed more extensive bruising on the R forearm than she had appreciated and above the wrist over the muscular soft tissue on the front of the arm, a site less likely to be banged by a child.  She revised her opinion of this injury and considered it more likely a gripping or grasping injury.  Although she could not make the same observations in relation to the injury to the L forearm if considered on its own, taken together with the R forearm as symmetrical sites, she concluded that it was less likely that this too was accidental.  

 
	She considered the explanation given for the knee bruising to be possible, but unlikely.  The bruises were well-defined and circular in nature and she again postulated a gripping type injury.  Again, symmetry with similar but less extensive bruising to the L leg increased suspicion. 

 
	Dr Ward considered the previous evidence in relation to the presence of a positive lupus anti-coagulant identified as present in 2011 and concluded that it was likely a transient effect possibly related to a viral infection.  Dr Leisner, consultant paediatric haematologist specialising in bleeding disorders, reported after Dr Ward, in August 2013 and confirmed this conclusion.  She was able to offer her opinion based on many years experience in managing children with easy bruising and bleeding and investigating them for possible blood clotting disorders.  She advised that the tests done at Salisbury hospital in June 2013 conclusively showed that the lupus anticoagulant demonstrated in December 2011 has now disappeared.  The presence of lupus anticoagulant causing increased tendency to bleeding and bruising is typically transient and self-limiting and rarely lasts as long as 6 months, and the period in which it causes easy bruising is much more short-lived, a few days or weeks at most.  However the lupus anticoagulant may remain persistently positive for 3-4 months causing no particular symptoms.  Dr Leisner also advised that she had never heard of or come across a case of a relapse or recrudescence of the condition triggered by childhood infection.  She concludes that there is no evidence of persistent haematological cause for S's bruising.  Previous tests done in 2011 had already ruled out any inherited disorders.

 
	I turn next to the parents' accounts.  M gave evidence, telling the court that she did not cause any bruising to S, or see that done by anyone else.  It was clear that she wanted to believe that S was again suffering from a medical condition similar to that which she had been advised was the cause of bruising on the last occasion.  She exhibited some understanding that the medical evidence effectively ruled that out as a possibility.  

 
	M described how she saw S's cheeks become very red and purple in colour as she strained to vomit on the Saturday night, and that the bruising started to come through then being clearer the next morning. There was some confusion as to whether she had previously said that she first saw the bruising on the Sunday morning, and she was unable now to recall clearly.  She confirmed that the bruising appeared as seen in the photographs, not initially as pinprick red dots then changing over time, as was suggested by her counsel to Dr Ward.  M told the court that Dr Lwin had agreed that the bruising might have been caused by vomiting.  When MGM later gave evidence, she also said the same.  However, in an e-mail Dr Lwin states that this is not the case, and I note the content of his report and the steps he took in admitting S.  M described S as not her usual lively self that night, and added, rather worryingly, that S had been "floppy, like a doll".  When asked why she had not taken S to the GP, particularly given the previous concerns, she said she thought S was OK, and took her when asked to by the social worker.

 
	M explained how she thought that the bruising to the knee was caused by S trying to climb into T's cot, something she had only seen once, but thought F had observed on a few occasions.  M appeared to suggest that S had got her knee stuck and that she had to help S pull her knee back out, before putting her to back to bed.  She said she noticed bruising to S's knee the next day.  In terms of timing, she said this occurred a few days, possibly a week, before the vomiting incident.

 
	M was unable to give an explanation for the marks on S's arms.  She knew S had banged her head against the cot; otherwise she could not help with how S sustained the bruise on her temple.

 
	M denied having dressed S in tights to cover up the bruises to her leg.  She explained that although it was a hot day, she had run out of clean socks for S.  There was a concern in the earlier proceedings that makeup had been applied to S's bruises before she was seen at the hospital.  M maintained the account given in the earlier proceedings that S had applied the make up herself. 

 
	M had been happy to work with the LA and to have their help and advice.  The MGM had also been providing support.  She did not see any particular difficulty with F not assisting her with the children in the morning at times when he was unwell or catching up with sleep having stayed up in the night.  She described how F had difficulty sleeping which became worse when the children returned.  She described herself as a heavy sleeper and that it was F who would wake to the children and if necessary stay up through the night.  M described her loving relationship with S and T, describing S as 'more cuddly' and T as preferring to turn to F for comfort.  She accepted that work had been done to try to 'even out' their roles with each of the children.

 
	M accepted that concerning bruising to S had occurred only while in their care.  When asked to consider if it was possible that F had hurt S, she told the court that she "knew for a fact" that F had not done so saying "I have that trust in him, he wouldn't".  She was asked to consider why she still had such a level of trust given the incident in July 2013 when F had injured her arm, something that had greatly upset her, was a real shock to her and she had not believed he would do.  M adhered to her belief that F would not hurt S.  She accepted that having said she would, she had not reported this incident to the police.

 
	M was full of praise for H who she described as 'doing a lovely job'.  She told the court how she was always kept informed about what they were doing and the good communication at contact handovers.  It was clear that this was a placement both parents would be happy to support and would not disrupt if the children could not return to their care. Both parents were keen to keep a greater level of direct with the children if they were to remain out of their care, and confirmed their commitment to it.  

 
	F gave evidence about the incident in July 2013.  He confirmed that it occurred because he thought M had deliberately stood on his ankle to wind him up, and so he jumped up and hit her, delivering what he described as "a play fight punch".  He denied that this had happened before.  When it was put to him that this had caused a similar sort of injury to that seen on S's arm he replied "it is similar to you, but no".  He continued to deny that the incident should be considered as serious, saying it was not a "full-on proper hit", was through a blanket, only caused one little mark and it had not been meant in any nasty way. 

 
	He was asked about the bruising to S and denied having caused it or having seen M cause it.  Like M, he too wanted to believe that it was due to the lupus anticoagulant, although he knew it wasn't.  He had first noticed the bruising to S's face on the Saturday night.  When asked if he was worried about it, he said he was and he wasn't.  He accepted that S had only been taken to the GP when they were asked to, and volunteered that they had "not been quick off the mark". 

 
	F confirmed that he "loved S to bits" as if she were his own child and called her "his princess", T being the "little man".  He explained how S would try to climb into T's cot and would slip.  He thought this had happened a couple of times between the time S saw the GP and when S was seen at the hospital.  He described how sometimes he would go into the children's bedroom and S would be there "shocked and stunned" when he came in.  He was unable to explain why S would appear that way, but thought it might be something to do with night terrors. He denied that S was frightened of him or that he would do anything other than put her back into her bed.  The other bruises he put down to rough play including 'play fighting'.

 
	He dismissed as "rubbish" concerns about his lack of support or motivation to help around the house.  

 
	It appears that S has given no direct account herself to anyone about how she got her bruises or indeed said that either of the parents has hurt her.  She declined to respond when spoken to at the hospital; indeed she appears to have been quite silent before falling asleep.  However, Miss Thomas includes information in her statements about comments reported to have been made by S since she returned to H's care.  These include "don't bang my head" when she was being settled into bed, "get off me, don't hit me"  when mis-behaving, and aggressive behaviour such as kicking and making fists, including towards T, accompanied by words such as "come nearer and you'll get it", "I'm not having it", "I'll kill you", "I'm not caring for you, I'll send you back".  Further accounts of what S has said are contained in a letter provided by solicitors acting for H dated 10 February 2014.  That S has said these things does not appear to be challenged.  It also appears to be accepted that S was not seen to have extensive or concerning bruising at any time while she was in the care of H.  

 
	I set out next Dr Richer's evidence in relation to the children.  Dr Richer, who is a very experienced consultant clinical child psychologist, was asked to assess and report on S and T.  He provided his report in October 2013, as ever a model of brevity and clarity, as was his oral evidence.  Dr Richer identified that both children behave in a strongly avoidantly insecure way towards both parents.  He expanded on this in evidence, setting out in some detail how he had identified this from observing the contact visit, and explaining why those not attuned to assess such matters could easily miss or misinterpret a child's behaviour. This was in contrast to their behaviour with their excellent foster carer which was much more secure.  

 
	Dr Richer identifies that S's early experiences before she was taken into care have left her deeply insecure.  He discounted that this might be the result of the earlier removal, S's behaviour on going into foster care being much more disturbed than could be accounted for by that fact alone.  In addition, S's fear exhibited at the first contact after her earlier removal, particularly of F, was significant and showed disturbed, avoidant and resistant behaviour.  I note that this was a concern that Dr Debelle had raised in 2012.  A child who was securely attached would not be expected to behave in this way.  T having been moved at 5 months was unlikely to show later consequences of any early attachment deficient parenting. 

 
	He suggests that there is evidence that the parents lacked skill and commitment early on and found it difficult to sustain nurturant care.  Crucially, S's behaviour when first in care, taken with both children's behaviour after the failed rehabilitation attempt, indicates that they were highly stressed, if not traumatised. S's attachment system is the most damaged, T's behaviour more indicative of post-traumatic stress than deep insecurity.  Dr Richer identified that H has worked skilfully and hard to correct S's insecurities and achieved considerable success, although the rehabilitation attempt set matters back.  He considers H to be very sophisticated in her understanding of how to improve attachment security, and that she is the best source of therapy for the children. 

 
	Dr Richer was unequivocal in his recommendation that the children must not move from their current placement.  He set out clearly the problems that had occurred particularly for S as a result of the age and developmental stage she had reached when the first rehabilitation was attempted.  The same mistake might apply to T, given that he was now just over 3 years old.  Rehabilitation home for a second time he assessed would be highly damaging and virtually guarantee that the children would develop psychological problems and underachieve educationally.   A move to another placement carried similar risks which Dr Richer set out in his evidence, including drug abuse, early pregnancy, placement breakdown leading to further insecurity and general life failure.

 
	On the issue of contact, he saw little value in the current frequency of contact and described it as something the children endure rather than gain from.  A substantial reduction would be of benefit.  In evidence he was rather unspecific about what that substantial reduction should be, talking about 6 � 12 times a year, but when asked to consider it in terms of benefit to the children, struggled to find much benefit, other than what might be derived in later years.  He identified that seeing birth parents consistently over the years can be beneficial, rather than suddenly having contact not having seen them for some time.  Once or twice a year would be enough.

 
	I heard from Miss Tubbs who was the children's social worker during the previous proceedings and up until Miss Thomas took over in June 2013.  She had worked with the parents during the rehabilitation phase and described how M and F had made significant progress, although M perhaps showed more engagement than F.  She had seen a positive bond and attachment between the children and the parents, which was a significant change in that period.  She confirmed that the LA had engaged psychological advice in relation to the children's needs and to direct the work done with the parents, and that generally the progress being made continued to be in the right direction.   Contact improved over time to the point where S was saying that she wanted to go home. 

 
	Her experience of visiting during the period the children were returned to the parents was that for the first few weeks, F was up and supporting M to care for the children, but this changed.  M she described as happy and well and enjoying her time with the children, asking questions and seeking guidance.  The children were clean and well presented and the house tidy.  However, she was concerned that the parents did not have a good understanding of the children's needs as a result of having been in foster care and their need for a high level of emotional reassurance.  

 
	Miss Tubbs confirmed that T managed the transition rather better than S, both children finding it difficult to leave their foster carers.  However, it was her assessment that while the parents continued to need a lot of support in their care of the children, there was nothing to indicate that this plan was not working until concerns were raised about the bruising.  She confirmed that there had been no other child protection concerns raised throughout that nine week period. 

 
	She told the court that issues the foster carers had experienced with S when she came into their care in 2011 were re-presenting when S returned to them in June 2013.  This included S not wanting anyone to touch her face, particularly her mouth, and over eating.  Miss Tubbs had visited the children in foster care in June 2013 and noted S's very difficult demanding and aggressive behaviour.  T too was exhibiting changed behaviour in not wanting his nappy changed, either by H or at nursery.  He has also found it very difficult to leave the foster home for any period of time.

 
	Miss Tubbs confirmed that the LA's plan was for the children to be adopted and that contact should be restricted to the usual indirect letterbox contact.  T's contact has already been reduced as he was finding weekly contact too difficult.  The LA considered direct contact would be confusing to the children and that it would be important that they were able to settle into any permanent placement with reassurance that there would not be a future move.  It was her view, which she acknowledged differed from that of Dr Richer, that contact was affecting the children as demonstrated by their behaviours both in and out of contact. 

 
	The CG evidence, once he had confirmed his position in supporting the children remaining with their current carers by whom they would be adopted, was confined to the issue of contact.  He was unequivocal in his view that it would be "entirely wrong" for the court to make any contact orders as the situation required flexibility in the future to respond to the children's developing needs.  It would be wrong to make an order that might not be appropriate in the future.  He identified that for S and T the purpose of future contact would be to address the issues that any child in an adoptive placement is likely to have about identity, and to have a sense of reality about their birth family.  It was not in their interests to continue to have a relationship of some significance with the parents, but it might well be that some minimal contact would be beneficial at an appropriate time for S and T.  The CG had no concerns that M and F would be unable to support this or would seek to disrupt the placement, they having always acted in a reasonable and considered way in relation to the children's placement with H.  Indeed the CG had been impressed by the parents on a number of levels in accepting without challenge the anxieties shown by the children in contact and waiting patiently and gently encouraging them to engage.  The CG was also confident that if placed with H, they as very skilled and able carers with a good understanding of the children's needs were in the best position to determine if and when direct contact would be of benefit for the children and to make the appropriate contact with the parents via the letterbox system.  It was important that they should be in a position to make those decisions.  It was of considerable benefit that H already knew the parents and were used to supporting the children in contact with them.      

 
Factual Findings
	I have reminded myself of the relevant legal principles that apply in relation to factual findings which I summarise as follows.  The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. If the court finds that a fact is proved, the court will treat that fact as established and all future decisions about a child's welfare will be based on that finding. Equally, if a particular finding sought is not proved, the court must disregard the allegation completely. There is no room for a finding that something may have happened. 

 
	Findings must be based on evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the evidence and not on suspicion or speculation. When considering cases of suspected child abuse the court must take into account all the evidence and consider each piece of evidence in the context of all the other evidence. Judges are guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations of the witnesses. 

 
	The evidence of the parents is of the utmost importance. It is essential that the court forms a clear assessment of their credibility and reliability. They must have the fullest opportunity to take part in the hearing and the court is likely to place considerable weight on the evidence and the impression it forms of them.

 
	Witnesses may tell lies in the course of an investigation and when giving evidence and that a witness may lie for many reasons.  The fact that a witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything.  The court will need to consider carefully how such evidence should be treated.

 
	Appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of medical experts, but it is not the only available evidence and expert opinion needs to be considered in the context of all the other evidence. The roles of the court and the expert are distinct. It is the court that is in the position to weigh up expert evidence against the other evidence and there may be cases, if the medical opinion evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of non-accidental injury, where a judge, having considered all the evidence, reaches the conclusion that is at variance from that reached by the medical experts. The court must resist the temptation to believe that it is always possible to identify the cause of injury to a child.  

 
	It is always desirable, where possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in the public interest and in the interest of the child.  In order to make a finding that a particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. However, it may not always be possible to make a determination, and a judge should not strain to do so, but identify who should remain in the pool of potential perpetrators.  The test of whether a particular person is in the pool of possible perpetrators is whether there is likelihood or a real possibility that he or she was the perpetrator.  

 
	I have applied these principles, as I have considered the evidence in relation to the factual findings sought.  

 
	I start with the bruises to the face.  The bruises to the cheeks are sited symmetrically on each side, and I would describe them as being on or below the cheekbone, which fits with Mrs Penny's description.  The parents' oral evidence was that this bruising appeared as it is seen in the photographs, almost immediately after S had been vomiting on the evening on 25 May 2013.  They did not suggest the bruising had changed in any way and had assumed it was caused by S retching.  It was certainly visible the next morning and was seen by the nursery and Mrs Penny at the beginning of the following week.  I accept Dr Ward's evidence that the symmetry and site of these injuries is unusual, albeit I note that they are not in the fleshy centre of the cheeks. 

 
	The injury over the temple does not appear to be recorded by any observers until S was seen at the hospital, however, it may not have been visible under her fringe which I note was held back for photographs to be taken.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to say when this bruising occurred, and whether it occurred at the same time as any of the other bruising.  Dr Ward raised some concerns in her evidence about the position of this bruise and lack of explanation.  I note that M said she thought S might have hit her head on the cot, but there did not appear to be any clear indication as to when this occurred.    

 
	I turn next to the bruising to the legs.  This bruising could represent one episode of injury or several over a period.  If the latter, it gives some weight to the cause being a repeated action, although I note Dr Ward's observation that one would not expect to see such a broad spread of bruising.  Both parents have given accounts of seeing such bruising after S got her knee stuck between the cot bars.  M said this had occurred some days before the vomiting episode, which ties in with what was said to Mrs Penny on 28 May and F says this happened on a couple of occasions after S had been seen by the GP.  On 29 May when S was seen by the GP she noted only bruising on the anterior aspect of the shin.  By 30 May, the more extensive bruising to the knees was observed and recorded by Mrs Penny.  I am satisfied that the GP would have noted such extensive bruising had it been present.  I therefore find that the knee bruising seen in the photographs occurred during the period between 29 May and 30 May 2013. I find it is likely that this cluster of bruises resulted from one incident rather than being a collection of bruises of differing ages.  I accept Dr Ward's opinion that the site of these bruises is unusual and note her comments about possible symmetry with marks around S's left knee.  

 
	The bruising to the arms does not appear to have been noted until S was examined by Dr Lwin.  However, Mrs Penny did not remove S's top, and it is not clear whether the GP carried out a full observation of S's arms.  I am unable to say when these bruises appeared.  I accept Dr Ward's opinion that a child is less likely to accidentally hit their forearm causing bruising in this area and note her comments about symmetry being more suggestive of a non-accidental cause.

 
	The remaining bruises have no features suggestive that they may have been deliberately inflicted.  The amount of bruising seen on S is a concern.

 
	I turn next to the issue of likely causation.  Tests carried out in the previous proceedings have ruled out any organic or inherited blood disorder.  I have considered the possibility that the cause of these bruises is the presence of a transient lupus anticoagulant.  Dr Leisner's evidence is unequivocal on this issue and based on testing carried out within a very few days of the bruising having first been observed.  If the lupus anticoagulant is not present, it cannot be the cause of the bruising, and I can immediately rule that out.  

 
	In the absence of an underlying medical cause for the bruising, Dr Ward identifies the likely cause of the bruising as blunt trauma, whether deliberately inflicted or otherwise.  I have considered whether the bruises to the cheeks might have been caused by S vomiting.  The medical evidence was that forceful vomiting might potentially lead to pinprick red spots, but none of the experts accepted that it could cause the bruising seen in the photographs, or that initial petechial bruising could develop into those marks.  I do not accept M's and MGM's evidence that Dr Lwin agreed the cheek bruising was due to vomiting.  I find it is unlikely that these bruises are the result of S having vomited.  Their origin is more likely than not the result of a blunt trauma to both sides of the face.

 
	None of the bruising is pathognomic of deliberately inflicted injury.  There are no clear hand prints or finger marks requiring explanation.  The bruises that Dr Ward suggests are more likely than not caused by a gripping or grasping action are consistent with that mechanism, but could also be consistent with a number of alternative mechanisms.

 
	Where it is suggested that parents may have caused injury to a child, detailed observations of the parents, both in giving evidence and the way in which they have conducted themselves throughout the proceedings, obviously assists the court in determining whether that is likely or not.  I have found both M and F to be co-operative and engaged in the process throughout.  Their desire to have the children returned to their care is sincere and undoubted.  However, I had a number of concerns about the accounts that they gave.  It a concern that both parents continued to raise the lupus inhibitor as a potential explanation for the bruising long after the medical evidence had effectively excluded that possibility.  I accept their evidence that the cheek bruising occurred at around the time when S was unwell and vomiting, although I have found it is unlikely to have been caused by that.  Neither parent is able to give an alternative explanation for how these injuries have occurred at that time in a very unwell child, described as limp and not her usual lively self.  

 
	The parents did not appear to appreciate why there was concern that it was only when S was in their care that she appeared with such a significant amount of bruising.  F's explanation that it could have been caused by rough play, or play fighting raises issues of lack of appropriate supervision given S's age, and should also be considered in the context of how he similarly described his assault on M.

 
	Their evidence that they had no difficulty in managing the children once they returned to their care is not credible in the light of the evidence about how the children presented when returned to H's care, and in the light of Dr Richer's assessment.  The LA was aware that S was finding the experience more difficult than T, and a high level of support was being provided.  The LA was concerned at the parents' level of understanding of S's emotional needs at this time.  

 
	I accept the parents' evidence that S was trying to climb in to T's cot and that she was hurting herself when doing this.  I have considered their descriptions of how S would get her knee stuck in the cot bars which appears to have happened on more than one occasion and I do find that credible.  I accept Dr Ward's evidence that it is unlikely that getting her knee stuck in the cot bars would cause these injuries, but I note the parents describing having to push S's knee back through.  This might well have involved a gripping or grasping action to be applied to the knee, which if done with excessive force could be a cause of such bruising.  

 
	It is most concerning that the parents took no action when these bruises appeared.  On 25 May, S was obviously extremely unwell.  M's description of her being "limp" is very worrying indeed.  It seems no medical advice was sought.  The bruising around the knees it appears was simply covered up; no further appointment had been sought with the GP.  The parents should have been concerned about such extensive bruising suddenly appearing within such a short time. Covering up bruises was a concern raised in the earlier proceedings.  M's account that on the previous occasion S applied the makeup herself is not credible.  At the time, F admitted in his police interview that this had been done as M was worried about what people might think.  F confirmed that in May 2013, they were again worried about what might happen as a result of S having sustained more bruising in their care.  I find it is significant that S was sent to the nursery in tights on 31 May 2013, which on my assessment of the evidence would be the day after the knee bruises are likely to have first appeared.  M's explanation that this was because there were no socks I find not truthful.    

 
	The incident in July raises obvious concerns about F's volatility and the fact that he inflicted injuries to M, including bruising to her arm that appears to have similarities to that seen on S.  It is also of concern that when giving their evidence, both parents and MGM sought to minimise it, raising the possibility that they might also take the same approach to other matters.  It did not seem to have given M any cause to reconsider her view about F, who she continues to believe would not have harmed S. I found F to have shown no sign of taking any responsibility for his actions.

 
	Finally, the evidence of what S has said strongly suggests that she has either been hit, or been afraid of being hit, and been worried that T might be hit.  I can be confident that this has not happened while she has been cared for by H.  S's aggressive behaviour is linked to words that are likely to be repeats of what she has heard adults say.  While some of that could be due to watching inappropriate material, other comments such as being sent back are most likely to have been directed at her.  Again, I can exclude these comments having emanated from H.    

 
	Having carefully balanced all of the relevant evidence, I am satisfied that taken overall it does support a finding on the balance of probabilities that some of the bruising is likely to have been inflicted on S by one or both of the parents, as follows.  I find that the bruising to the cheeks is more likely than not inflicted during the evening of 25 May.  I am satisfied that it is unlikely that this was caused accidentally.  How it was caused I am unable to say; it may represent a gripping injury, or she may have been hit to both sides of the head.  The bruising to the knees I find to have occurred between 29 and 30 May, and likely to be the result of S's knee having been gripped with inappropriate force.  The injuries to the arms I also find likely to have been inflicted.  I find it unlikely that S would have caused these injuries to herself given their location.  These injuries may be the result of inappropriate gripping of the forearm as Dr Ward suggests, or could be the result of a direct punch or hit.    My findings in relation to these injuries suggest that S has been subjected to rough handling, likely by an adult in temper, under stress, and struggling to provide appropriate care in such circumstances. This raises a distinct possibility that these are not the only such incidents to have occurred.  I make no findings in relation to likely causation of the remaining bruises.

 
	I have considered whether it is possible to identify the likely perpetrator, the parents being the only potential perpetrators in the pool.  Within the proceedings, neither parent has blamed the other, although in M's statement she suggests that they were doing so immediately after the children were removed.  

 
	The evidence suggests that F was finding it more difficult than M to cope with the children after they were rehabilitated.  The difference seen in his relationship with T from that with S was of sufficient concern that the LA included some work in the plan to address this.  F himself points out that there have been no injuries to T.  His increased difficulty sleeping and being unavailable to assist in the mornings left M to manage on her own, but ongoing observations of her with the children raised no concerns.  The parents agreed that it was F who was left to manage S when she woke up at night, and his evidence about how S would appear when he went into the room suggests a child in a state of fear.  This behaviour must be considered in the context of S's apparent fear of F at the first contact visit after she was removed in 2011.  The incident in July when he lashed out at M, albeit an isolated incident, demonstrates that F is capable of inflicting a similar type of physical harm to that inflicted on S, when angry and under stress.  There are no such indications in relation to M. These considerations support a finding that it is more likely than not that F is the perpetrator of these injuries to S.  I find it unlikely that M would not have been aware of F's inappropriate handling of S, and the evidence supports a finding that M has failed to act protectively.      

 
	In addition to finding that F has caused injury to S, the evidence supports a general finding that S's physical safety and well-being has been grossly neglected by both M and F.  This finding is made in the context of the previous history, known to both M and F, that concerns had been raised previously about excessive bruising to S.  Being aware that S was covered in bruises they took no steps to treat them, protect her from further injury, or seek medical advice until directed to do so, and this at a time when they themselves were apparently expressing concern that the injuries might once again be due to the lupus defect.  M's reaction was to try to cover them up.

 
	Finally, I have considered the finding sought that the children's emotional needs have not been met while in the care of M and F, including prior to being removed in 2011.  I am satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that the parents found caring for S and T prior to the LA first becoming involved in 2011 a difficult task, and failed to meet their emotional needs.  Similarly, following rehabilitation, both parents were again overwhelmed at times in managing the children's care and meeting their needs.  Their inability to properly understand the children's emotional needs as a result of having been in foster care has almost certainly contributed to this.  These findings are supported by the evidence from the earlier proceedings and Dr Richer's assessment which I accept and rely on.  The fact that it is made with the benefit of hindsight does not detract from his conclusions.  I have considered how such a finding fits with the LA's observations during the period the children were with the parents and note that there remained concerns and a high level of support continued to be provided.  The report of the psychologist instructed by the LA during the rehabilitation process, but not previously disclosed, sets out those concerns and gives the background context within which the LA thought it was working.

 
Threshold findings
	On the basis of these findings, I am satisfied that the required threshold criteria under s.31(2) Children Act 1989 are met.  S has suffered significant physical and emotional harm and neglect, and T has suffered significant emotional harm and neglect.  This harm has occurred while in the care of M and F, and is attributable to their not giving the children the care it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give.  

 
Welfare considerations
	I turn now to consider the LA's application for care orders, and if granted, placement orders.  I remind myself that the welfare of the children is the paramount consideration and the matters set out in the welfare checklist in s.1(3) Children Act 1989 must be considered and balanced.  As the LA care plan is for adoption, it is also necessary to consider the provisions of the welfare checklist provided in s.1(4) Adoption and Children Act 2002.

 
	The children are not expressing any desire to return to the care of their parents, indeed S has said that she does not wish to return home, and T is finding it extremely difficult to leave the foster carer's house which appears to be a place of some security for him.  Dr Richer described how they 'manage' contact with their parents.  This expression of their current wishes and their relationship with their parents must be considered in the light of their experience of being removed twice from the care of their parents, and having spent a considerable period in the care of H.  When the LA was previously working towards returning the children to the care of their parents, S was said to have expressed different views, however I have found since then that she has been subject to physical ill-treatment.  The children will have no understanding of the longer term issues to be considered by the court at this time, including in relation to adoption.

 
	S and T have suffered a disrupted childhood and neglect of their needs which has impacted on their development as identified by Dr Richer.  The children are now in need of therapeutic parenting which in his view is best provided by the children remaining with H.  He has set out the risk of harm and the possible long-term implications for the children if there are further disruptions to their attachments at what he identifies as critical stages in their development.  It is his firm opinion that the children should not experience any change in their circumstances, except in so far as that reinforces and supports the placement.  He is supported by the CG in these views.  The LA does not intend moving the children now that a way forward has been found to underpin this placement with permanency.  The LA relies on and accepts Dr Richer's conclusions and Miss Tubbs told the court how important it is that S and T are parented by carers who know about and understand the children's attachment difficulties, have an awareness of the children's experiences to date and have the skill and ability to read and manage their complex behaviours.  The current carers are in a particularly strong position in being able to meet the children's needs as skilled foster carers with a good understanding of attachment needs, and in having experienced with S and T the changes in placement and understanding the background to and reasons for the court proceedings.

 
	S and T are half siblings, but have grown up together and will have no understanding at this age of such issues.  Sibling relationships are generally considered some of the most important in a child's life, particularly where there are shared experiences of upbringing, and indeed normally endure long into adulthood providing mutual support.  The LA does not intend that they should be separated and this would not appear to be in either child's interest. 

 
	If S and T were to return to the care of M and F it is likely that they would be at risk of suffering further similar harm to that which I have already identified has occurred.  I have no doubt that M and F are genuine in their love for both S and T and have tried to do their best taking into account their own limitations and parenting abilities, and more recently in the extremely difficult circumstances of the children having returned to their care after an extensive period in foster care where they received a very high level of care.  However, the sad conclusion has to be reached that these parents could not cope, and are simply unable to manage parenting these children to a good enough standard where they would be safe in their care.  That is unlikely to change given their inability to manage even with a high level of support and guidance which was provided during the rehabilitation phase and continued during the time S and T were in their care between March and May 2013.  I have taken into account Dr Richer's evidence about the relationship the children have with their parents, the insecure attachments both children exhibit. I have considered the CG view as to the level of relationship that is appropriate for the children with their parents in the future. 

 
	I have considered whether the MGP's could offer a permanent home for the children.  MGM gave evidence which left me in no doubt that they are sincere and have the best of motives in putting themselves forward; indeed they are described by the LA as loving and committed grandparents with whom the children have a positive relationship.  In spite of that, the conclusion of the viability assessment is negative.  I am asked to consider whether this is a report that should be relied upon given the positive special guardianship report which is to be filed in separate proceedings in relation to another granddaughter currently being looked after by the MGP's.  That report is, of course, considering matters from the perspective of the child to which it relates, and in these proceedings, I must consider matters from the perspective of S and T, and taking into account their needs as I have already identified them. 

 
	There are very clear difficulties in relation to this proposal, not least the number of children that MGM would be caring for within the household.  They have two children of their own living in the household, as well as their granddaughter who is 2 years old.  To accommodate S and T, into an already no doubt busy household will be a challenge.  That challenge is increased by their need for a high level of attention and therapeutic parenting.  Listening to the MGM's evidence, I found her unable to properly understand the concerns of the LA, particularly in adhering to the lupus inhibitor as a possible cause of the bruising, suggesting that she had heard Dr Lwin agree that the cheek bruising was the result of S vomiting, and down playing the difficulties in the relationship between M and F, specifically the incident in July 2013.  The LA questions their ability to properly understand S and T's attachment difficulties and the impact their early life experiences and changes have had on their emotional development, and to provide sufficiently protective parenting.  I accept the LA's concerns in relation to this potential placement.

 
	I have considered the implications for S and T if they are not to return to their parents' care or that of the MGP's.  This would result in them growing up outside their birth family with all that brings in the form of a need for a sense of identity and understanding of how that comes to be necessary.  Dr Richer has identified that the success of such a placement is likely to be dependent upon the skill and commitment of the carers and that although both foster placements and adoptive placements carry a risk of breakdown, there are a number of factors in this case that attach to the placement with H that would mitigate against such risks. I remind myself that the severing of family ties is only to be taken in circumstances where it can be said that is necessary and proportionate to meet the children's welfare.  The court should consider carefully what links might be appropriately retained if such a placement is found to be required.    

 
	I have considered whether there is a realistic option for the children to remain in long term foster care.  Such an option would mean the children retained a legal link with their birth family, and possibly some limited contact.  The LA's view is that long term foster care is insufficiently secure for these children who, given their attachment difficulties, will have a high need for a sense of identity and permanence which can only be provided by them being adopted.  Dr Richer was rather less convinced that this needed to be provided by an order, rather than by the reality of the children's experience living with their carers, but I understood him to be giving a psychologists view of the situation.  The difficulty with such an order is the inability to ensure in the long term that the children remain in that placement, a particular difficulty where H are agency foster carers, and the on-going and potentially stigmatising experience for the children of being 'in care' with all the intrusive monitoring that involves.  I find it a significant disadvantage that their actual carers would not hold parental responsibility for them rather than the LA being their corporate parent.

 
	I have considered whether a Special Guardianship Order might be appropriate to meet these children's needs.  A legal link with the birth family would be retained, but the ability of the parents to exercise their parental responsibility would be limited.  The Special Guardians would hold parental responsibility and the disadvantages I have identified of being 'in care' would not apply.  I take into account that a SGO is an order that is capable of being reversed.  Unlike an adoption order, no permanent legal link would be created for the children with the Special Guardians.  Their status within the placement would be dependent upon the order remaining, and ends when they reach adulthood.  For these particular children, their experiences to date create a particular need for them to have a sense of permanency about a future placement, and this factor must be given a great deal of weight.                  

 
	Finally, I have considered the implications for the children of them being adopted and becoming full members of their adoptive family, who will have sole parental responsibility for them.  Such an order would extinguish all legal ties with the birth family but provide the sense of permanence and identity it is suggested that these children will need, not only throughout their childhood, but as adults.  The LA would only be involved in supporting the adoptive placement and any contact.  This is the most far-reaching interference in the parties' article 8 rights and where they may be in conflict, those of children take precedence.  In this case, I take into account that the parents themselves support this placement if the court concludes that the children cannot return to their care.

 
	I have considered and balanced the various options and reminded myself of the very high level of justification required to allow a court to approve a plan for adoption as being necessary and proportionate.  I conclude that in this case, the evidence is clearly in support of a conclusion that both S's and T's welfare will only be adequately met by them remaining where they are in the very capable care of H.  The permanency needed for this placement can only be secured through the making of adoption orders.  I am satisfied that the LA has taken all appropriate steps to retain the children within the family, considered all reasonable alternative family placements and that this is a case of last resort, and that 'nothing else will do'.   I have framed my conclusion on the basis that the plan is for the children to remain with H.  I should add that, were the option of a placement with H not available, then the evidence would still support an adoptive placement for all the reasons I have set out. 

 
	On the issue of contact, I have considered the representations made and do not consider that the court should make any order in this regard.  I agree with and adopt the views of the CG that H is well-placed to make appropriate decisions about contact for S and T.  They will want to take into account my findings, the evidence of Dr Richer and the CG, as well as discussing matters with the LA's adoption team.   

 
	I approve the LA's care plan for adoption, and make the care orders required.

 
The placement application
	I turn next to consider the LA's application for a placement order.  The conclusions that I have reached in approving the care plan for adoption, and making the care orders apply equally in relation to this application.  I have already given consideration to the s.1(4) welfare checklist and remind myself that the welfare of the child is paramount.

 
	I am reminded by the case of Re A [2013] EWCA Civ 1611 that a placement order is an order which permits the LA to place a child for adoption with any prospective adopters who may be chosen by the authority.  In this case I am satisfied that the LA intends to place with H, as the amended care plan makes clear and the children's IRO, who should be provided with a copy of my judgement and the approved plan, has responsibility for ensuring that the plan is adhered to and any changes made to it are in the children's best interest.  In those circumstances, there seems to be no difficulty with the court granting a placement order so that the LA can formally 'place' the children with H as soon as matching has been completed.  The intention to place with named persons does not amount to a condition on the placement order.

 
	However, a difficulty arises in relation to dispensing with the parents consent to adoption, which is required under s.52(1) Adoption Children Act 2002.  The indications from the parents are that they will support H adopting the children.  This is a hugely important factor for children, parents, and H, and likely to contribute to the stability of the placement in the long-term that should be recognised.  I recognise they may not wish to consent to a placement order.  I cannot find that it is appropriate to dispense with parental consent to adoption in such circumstances where the parents would consent to an adoption application made by H.

 
	Refusal to make a placement order will prevent the LA formally placing the children with H as prospective adopters, but does not prevent H applying to adopt.   The court can give permission for an early application to be made if the statutory time-limits under s.42 ACA 2002 that determine when such an application can be made would result in delay.   It is likely in this case that such permission would be given. 

 
	The LA is concerned that the issue of parental consent may still need to be dealt with if the parents fail to give that consent.  Representations have been made by the parents that the court should not make the placement order for the reasons I have set out, and I propose to invite the parents to consider granting advance consent under s.20 to adoption of S and T by H.  I would hope this can be dealt with by the CG.  If necessary, I can adjourn the LA's application rather than dismiss it at this time.  If consent is forthcoming, the LA's application can be withdrawn or dismissed, if it is not, I will reconsider the application and the issue as to whether it is appropriate to dispense with parental consent.

HHJ WATSON: 

The representation today is as it was during the hearing.  I have the local authority, Coventry City Council, represented by Ms Greaves, who is a solicitor with the City Council.  Mother, Mother,  is represented again by Ms Collins of counsel, and father of A, Father, is represented again by Ms O'Reilly of counsel, and the children are represented, through their guardian, Sarah Parker, by Miss Moseley of counsel.

 
The local authority seeks care orders and placement orders in relation to both children.  C, born on the 27th April 2007 and A, born on the 1st August 2012.  

 
The birth father of C is unknown and has played no part in the proceedings.  C is now six and will be seven in April this year.  C has been brought up to believe that Father is his father and it is unclear whether he knows that this is not the case.  Some urgent work is required to assist him with his identity and knowledge of his parentage.

 
A is 18 months and she is the child of Mother and Father.  Mother, who is 22, Father, who is 30, have been in a relationship since October 2011, and very shortly after starting the relationship became engaged.  It has always been a volatile relationship which has been peppered by violent outbursts.

 
The allocated social worker, who became involved with the family on the 6th November of 2012, referred to a number of violent incidents reported to her by Mother.  I refer to these as a snapshot of the children's experience in the family home.

 
On the 20th December of 2012 she described how Father had kicked off and smashed a laptop and phone when both C and A were present, and on the same occasion, had broken the Moses basket stand, a light fitting and lampshade in their bedroom.  C was spoken to by social care and reported that he had not slept and that daddy had hit him hard six times.  He later stated that he had not been hit by his father.  

 
On the 18th January 2013 Mother called an ambulance at 9pm from the paternal grandmother's house and reported to the control room that C was out of control and had been biting and kicking.  When the paramedics arrived they noted that Father had his hand over C's mouth.  C was sitting quietly and crying.  C said to the paramedics that he did not want to go home to his flat because he was scared.  C was kept in hospital for observation.  The hospital observed that C was fine when mother was not present.  CAMHS completed an initial assessment and reported that C did not have ADHD nor autism.

 
On the 23rd January Mother agreed to Section 20 voluntary accommodation for C.  Care proceedings were issued on the 26th February and on the 1st March the court made an interim care order in respect of C.  A remained at home in the care of her parents. 

 
A further incident was reported to the police on the 23rd March of 2013 by Mother, of Father hitting the computer when A was present.  On the 9th April the team manager called both parents into the office to discuss concerns raised during home visits.  Mother reported another incident when Father had smashed up the flat.

 
On the 12th April the duty social worker attending the family home was concerned about Father's behaviour during that home visit, and she commented that voices had been raised, but A did not react.  Father said he was leaving the family home, but by the 16th April the parents had reconciled and both reported they wanted the relationship to continue.  However, later the same night Mother contacted the police to say Father was kicking off and had thrown the house keys at her.  The following day, the 17th April, The Haven Women's Refuge completed a risk assessment, but Mother was not suitable for assessment because she was still in a relationship with Father and had told the women's refuge that she was not frightened of him.  The matter returned to court on the 17th April and an interim care order was made in respect of A, and at the contested removal hearing on the 19th April, that was confirmed.  A was taken into foster care, but a separate placement to C.

 
When the court made the order for A to be removed into foster care, Mother left the court room screaming and crying.  Father was calm, and when coming out of court gave A a kiss.  Mother was loud and shouting and approached A and snatched her from the pushchair saying, nobody was taking her daughter away.  A did not react at all, she did not cry, she showed no reaction when placed with the carers and did not appear upset, she was indeed calm and placid.

 
During the course of the community-based assessment both parents disclosed a high level of inter-partner violence within their relationship, although Father had not been as forthcoming as Mother, and had tended to minimise his and Mother' behaviour.  Arguments resulted from disagreements over their parenting, over Mother' emotional difficulties and over Father's anger.  

 
On the 9th July of 2012, a few weeks before A was born, Father appeared before Coventry Magistrates on a charge of disturbance of the peace and was bound over to keep the peace following an incident in the home between him and Mother.  

 
The difficulties have been longstanding and follow a pattern of violent outburst followed by a resolve to leave and separate, which in the end is short-lived and the parties become reconciled.

 
On the 6th August of 2013 the parents decided to separate.  This decision coincided with a meeting to discuss the conclusion of the community-based assessment, which was negative.  Miss Gladys Chinniandur, the CBAS assessor, in her oral evidence to the court, described how the parents presented as a couple that day, but she was later told that they had decided to separate.  During the course of the assessment she had been told that they had separated but then, the next day, she was told they were back together again.  Miss Chinniandur was therefore sceptical about the parents' ability to maintain the separation.

 
She described their relationship as one of co-dependency, and that a very high level of contact was maintained with Father attending several times a day to walk Mother' dog.  When Mother was recently in hospital he had moved back into the flat to look after the dog.  Mother is pregnant with their child and wants to maintain a friendship with Father.  

 
Miss Chinniandur gave evidence of the risk that the relationship will resume.  The new baby is due on the 27th February and Mother is next due for a scan tomorrow, on the 22nd January, when it is anticipated a planned caesarean section will be arranged.

 
I turn now to the hearing.  Mother does not oppose the local authority's plan for C.  She accepts that she cannot provide the level of parenting necessary for C and she has taken a brave but child-focussed decision to allow the local authority to make the necessary arrangements for C.  He is described as a lovely little boy who should not be difficult to place, but his age and, at times, challenging behaviours might cause some delay in finding the right placement.  C has clear recollections of life at home and will need some therapeutic help to make sense of his experiences.  It is proposed to cast the net as wide as possible and to allow for a referral to CAMHS, the local authority will place his profile in the publication 'Be My Parent' to enable a nationwide search to be made.  A limit of 12 months will be put on the search for an adoptive placement.  In the meantime he was moved on the 11th January of this year to a new long-term foster placement.  This is an agency placement which is local and where C is the only child in the placement.  C can remain at the same school and the placement could become a long-term placement if not suitable adoptive placement is found.  C will receive the one-to-one attention all the professionals recommend that he needs.

 
Father does not put himself forward as a carer for C or A, but supports Mother in her wish to parent A and the unborn baby.  The guardian supports the local authority care plan for C and indeed for A.  There are no family members who are assessed as suitable to care for C.  Maternal grandmother was joined as a party to proceedings as a potential carer for C.  She had significant involvement with C throughout his childhood, and had brought private law proceedings for residence prior to the issue of care proceedings.  She was assessed by the local authority and also by an independent social worker, but the outcome of both assessments was negative and maternal grandmother was discharged from proceedings.

 
There are no alternative family members and the guardian, in her final analysis, recommends the making of a placement order for C with a reduction in contact, followed by a goodbye visit.  

 
It is necessary for a placement order to be made to ensure that a comprehensive search can be made.  The absence of a placement order would impede the search for prospective adopters, and the local authority have indicated in the care plan that if a 12-month search does not result in an adoptive placement being found, an application will be made to revoke that placement order.  In these circumstances the welfare of C requires that parental consent is dispensed with and a placement order is made for C.  

 
I turn now to A.  The local authority seek a care order and a placement order in respect of A, which is supported by the guardian but opposed by both Mother and Father.

 
Miss Collins, on behalf of Mother, sought an adjournment of the hearing because Mother has recently been in hospital following a concern that she might have gone into early labour.  She is tired and in some discomfort and would prefer to deal with the contested hearing after the birth of the new baby.  It has been said that there would be no prejudicial delay for A as it is intended that care proceedings be initiated in respect of the new born baby and to seek removal at birth and placement with A in foster placement, with a proposed care plan of adoption of both children together.

 
The adjournment was resisted by the local authority and the guardian as the dates for the final hearing had been set for some time, and it was always known that mother would be in the later stages of her pregnancy.

 
The proceedings of course are stressful and will be whether heard this week or whenever the baby is born, that is the nature of care proceedings.  Despite some early concerns about premature labour the medical position is clear, mother is not in early labour and there is no risk to her or the unborn baby in the proceedings continuing.  There will be prejudice however to A in further delay.  A has now been in foster care since April 2013 and will be two in July this year.  There is an urgent need for decisions to be made about her future placement.  

 
I refused the adjournment but said I would ensure that the hearing is conducted in such a way to ensure frequent breaks and time for Mother to properly conduct her case.  Mother coped well with the proceedings and was a confident and articulate witness.  

 
I turn now to the threshold.  The threshold is not in dispute in this case.  The parents have filed response to threshold in which they comment on some of the facts raised in the threshold, but do not dispute that there was justification for the initiation of proceedings.  

 
At A53 in the bundle, Father, whilst denying that he has an anger management problem, accepts that he has an emotional needs problem, and is receiving therapy from the Lighthouse Ministry charity.  He fully accepts that his behaviour is inappropriate on occasions and that he has had problems with anxiety and depression in the past, which the GP was treating with medication until January 2013 when Father was advised that he no longer needed that medication.

 
Mother accepts her diagnosis of personality disorder and depression.  She has been referred on one occasion to CRISAC, the crisis team.  She has, in the past, deliberately self-harmed, including self-cutting with a knife up to the age of 18 years.  On the 31st January of 2012, when C was in her care, she describes losing control to such an extent that she had thrown a glass across the room, so that it shattered.  She was put on medication to regulate her behaviour.  On the 9th February of 2012 she tried to take an overdose of tablets.  

 
Both parents accept that the children are put at risk of emotional and physical harm due to the volatile relationship and behaviour of both of them.  

 
The family had pet dogs which were causing problems in the home.  On the 9th March of 2012 social care described the home as being in a poor state and furniture torn or shredded by the dogs.  Although this is described as an exaggeration, the parents both agreed that the property was in a bit of a mess, but say that this is no longer a problem because the problem dog, Trigger, has been rehomed.  Unfortunately, problems continued with a request that the dogs be placed at the home of the paternal grandmother because the dog fights were putting C at risk in June of 2012.  This suggestion met with refusal because the dogs would fight with the paternal grandmother's dogs.  

 
One dog has remained in the family home, it is the family pet, but it has continued to cause problems for Mother who, because of her pregnancy, has been unable to walk the dog.  The dog she describes as boisterous.  It is only in her oral evidence on the final day of the hearing that she says for the first time that she has made arrangements for the dog to be rehomed, and that it would be going on Sunday, that is Sunday of the weekend just gone.  

 
The dog has continued to bind the parents together as it has been the reason given for Father needing to visit Mother' flat three times a day, despite the fact that both parents are adamant that their relationship is over, that they have separated, and that it is their joint wish that A be returned to the sole care of Mother, with Father staying away and being restrained by injunction from returning to the property.

 
Social care had concerns that the parents were unable to manage their finances in order to ensure the children's needs were met.  Both parents accepted that was the position, but in June of 2013 said that they had now worked things out together, and that Father had taken sole control of the finances in 2012 when FABB were involved.

 
There is, as a consequence, little evidence to suggest that Mother can manage her finances independently and her oral evidence suggested that Father was giving her money for electricity and to meet the expenses relating to the unborn child, certainly up to December and possibly up to the final hearing.  

 
The issues for the hearing were these, the court has to resolve a number of issues in order to decide what is in the best interests of the children, and it is of course the children's welfare which is the court's paramount consideration.  Do the parents recognise the deficiencies in their parenting?  Do they have insight into the local authority's concerns?  Can they make the necessary changes to their parenting?  Can they put into practise what they have learned in order to sustain the changes made?  Can that progress be maintained?  Ultimately, the question for the court is whether the parents can make the changes in the children's timescales.  In order to make that judgment I have to have regard to the evidence.  I heard first from the social workers.  I heard evidence from two social workers, Helen Fisher, who became the allocated social worker in November 2012, four months before the issue of proceedings.  She continued to work with the family until she went on maternity leave at the end of September of 2013.  Her successor, Lorraine Welch, took over responsibility on the 1st October of 2013, but she was a very familiar face to the family as she had co-worked the case previously with Miss Fisher.  

 
In my finding, the continuity of personnel in this case has benefitted the family and it is one of the positive features in the case that both Father and Mother are described as engaging well with both social workers.  They kept all their appointments with the community-based assessment team.  They have demonstrated a commendable commitment to contact and have opened up their home and been welcoming to visiting professionals.  I am satisfied that the parents' willingness to be assessed and commitment to the process cannot be questioned, and I am equally satisfied that they have been fairly and comprehensively assessed by the social workers.  

 
Helen Fisher developed a close working relationship with the parents, and I accept her professional observations and judgment.  She described her scepticism about the parents' ability to maintain separate and independent lives.  She describes how, on numerous occasions, they had told social care that they had separated where this proved not to be the case.  This was said by Mother, in April 2013, after the contested interim care order.  A was removed from her care into foster care and there could not have been a clearer indication of the need to separate, but Mother did not maintain the separation and Mother and Father presented as a committed couple in an enduring, long-term relationship for the duration of the CBAS assessment.  It was at the conclusion of that assessment, when the recommendations were outlined to the parents, that the decision to separate was made and said to be, this time, for good.

 
Miss Fisher acknowledged that the decision was taken on the 6th August and she did not have any evidence to suggest that they had resumed an intimate relationship, and there was no suggestion that Father and Mother were again living together.  However, Miss Fisher reported regularly seeing Father visiting the flat.  She saw him going in and out of the flat on her way into the offices as the flat is very close to the offices.  

 
Miss Fisher described how the parents are very dependent upon each other.  Mother has no family support and relies on Father and his mother.  Mother has said to her that she will separate for one year to allow Father to get help and then they will resume their relationship.  

 
When cross-examined on behalf of the children she listed the risks to the children from the continuation of the relationship as a real concern about the dynamics of the relationship, which has erupted into violent behaviour in the home, which has been witnessed by both children, and this was reported even during the CBAS assessment.  She also said Mother was very isolated and she described how she is emotionally, physically and financially dependent on Father.  Further, that she is pregnant with his child.  That it is a very significant level of contact, in that Father comes around two or three times a day to walk the dog and that Mother is still dependent on him.  This was evidenced by the fact that in the week preceding the hearing, because of concerns about the pregnancy, Mother went into hospital and Father moved back into the property to care for the dog.  

 
Miss Fisher was asked whether mother could care for A, and Miss Fisher was clear that she could not.  There were too many concerns around the pattern of the parents' relationship and their mental health.  The concerns were teased out further in cross-examination; there have been no reported incidents of domestic violence since August 2013.  Mother has self-reported in the past but there have been no such reports since August of 2013.  However, Miss Fisher pointed out that there is the protection that we are currently in proceedings.

 
Mother has significant emotional traumas from her childhood and has made allegations that her adoptive father sexually abused her and her younger adopted sister.  She disclosed that she had become pregnant with C as a consequence of gang rape.  To Miss Fisher, these are very significant and very troubling events for which Mother needs professional help.  

 
Miss Fisher gave evidence that a resource has been identified in the Olive Tree, which is a National Health Service referral, which can provide the necessary long-term therapy and also give individual support and advice and the intensive tailor-made work to effect changes.  However, Mother needs to access the service.  Miss Fisher herself had made appointments and tried to encourage Mother to attend.  The FABB team, who provided an intensive package of support to the family in 2012, a total of 86 sessions, also made appointments for Mother to attend the Olive Tree, which were not kept.  

 
At H24 in the bundle, the written report from the Olive Tree personality disorder service records that treatment is voluntary and usually lasts an average of three to four years.  To access the therapy there is an initial assessment where a team of 12 therapists from different backgrounds assess whether the individual has the minimum potential psychological mindedness to explore their relationships and have the courage and capacity to face necessary changes in their relationships.  This first assessment is therefore a crucial first step.  Mother was originally referred on the 30th January of 2012, but she did not respond to appointments made and her file was closed.

 
Her community psychiatrist re-referred her in November 2012 and she went back on the waiting list, and was offered seven appointments, but she only attended two and only for a limited period of time.  She was told clearly that she would be offered one further appointment, but that appointment was not kept and the assessment has not been completed.

 
In the week before the final hearing she was offered yet another appointment on the Tuesday, but she cancelled it and rearranged it for two weeks' time, on the 28th January, because of problems with her pregnancy.  Everybody is sympathetic to the intensity of this piece of work and the painful memories it will address, but the issue remains that it is work that needs to be done to effect change, and Mother has not even begun the process.  

 
I am satisfied that social care have done all within their power to facilitate the referral, but it is voluntary and Mother has to engage herself, and she has been unable to do this.  

 
Miss Fisher was clear in her evidence that Mother knew how important it was, knew how important social care thought it was but chose to prioritise other aspects of her life.

 
The truth of this assessment by Miss Fisher became very apparent when, in response to questions on behalf of the children through Miss Mosley, mother said that she had cancelled the appointment on the 14th January, two days before the final hearing, but she would be going to the rearranged appointment on the 28th January, but thought that the session would demonstrate that she did not require further work.  Her reason for not attending was because of difficulties in her pregnancy, but agreed, in cross-examination, that she had attended contact on the Monday before and the Wednesday after the Tuesday appointment.  There could not be clearer evidence that the Olive Tree appointment was a low priority and that Mother had no understanding of the need for therapy or the intensity of what is involved.  Further, that she has been putting off engagement with the Olive Tree for two years and that nothing has changed.

 
Miss Fisher was clear that her position and that of the local authority remains that adoption is in A's best interests and that social care have exhausted working with both parents.  Her concerns specifically related to A were that although the parents were recognising that they could not cope with C's behaviour, and Mother had shown insight into her attachment with C, neither Mother nor Father had insight into the impact of their behaviours as parents not just on C but also on A.  Their parenting style had also been harmful to A.

 
Miss Fisher said there were concerns about basic care currently as when received into foster care.  A, when received into foster care, aged nine months, was at the developmental stage of a five month old baby.  A had not been weaned.  Mother had been concerned about tongue-tie, but had not sought advice about weaning and it was questionable whether follow-on milk was necessary.  Within one week of placement in foster care A was fully weaned.

 
Mother has sadly not made significant progress.  Looking back to April 2012 when the FABB team were involved, the progress was described as extraordinary by Miss Fisher, but there was an over-dependency on the support workers.  When the intense level of support was withdrawn the parents could not cope and could not sustain the progress made or continue to implement the skills learned.  Miss Fisher described how the case had come full circle within three months of the nurturing support being put in place, within three months of that finishing the progress that had been made and had been evidenced by FABB, had not been sustained.  

 
I turn now to the views of other professionals.  Kate Brady, the Cafcass adviser in the case, at the interim care order hearing, at paragraph 25 of her report to the court dated the 15th April 2013, said: 

 
'It is my professional judgment, based on the information available to me, 	that Mother and Father lack insight and motivation to adequately parent their children safely.  In my opinion, this would be irrespective of any and all support services that have and would be offered to them.  They have not shown that they are capable of sustaining the necessary changes to prioritise their children's needs over their own.  They will not therefore be able to meet C's and A's needs now and in the future'.  

At the interim contested hearing A was removed and placed in foster care.  That was understandably a very distressing time for the parents, and mother's anger is perhaps to be expected, but it is the impact on A of their behaviours on the 17th April which has caused the professionals such concern.  Father came out of court, he was visibly upset but sufficiently controlled not to allow that to undermine his behaviour towards his daughter.  He remained calm and approached A to give her a kiss.  Mother was distraught, crying and shouting and picked A up.  Mother was unable to regulate her emotions and others had to intervene to take A from her.  A was impassive, remaining calm and unperturbed by her mother's outburst.  She showed no distress when taken and placed with strangers.  This total lack of an emotional response from A, then aged nine months, which had been witnessed by social care in the previous few days on another occasion, was a very significant concern to all the professionals involved in the case.

 
I turn now to the community-based assessment with CBAS.  The parents were fully assessed by the CBAS team consisting of the social worker, who came to give evidence in court, Gladys Chinniandur, and the support worker, Amanda Grumbly.  The assessment took place over 10 sessions and included four observed contact sessions.  At paragraph 260 and paragraph 261 there is a summary of the interventions by social care, significant input from Family Action, Building Bridges, the FABB team, between June to December 2012, followed by one-to-one support from Family Links and nurturing, interventions put in place to improve parenting capacity across all domains.  FABB offered 86 sessions totalling 224 hours.  At the conclusion of the FABB sessions the parents were reported to have acquired the skills to adequately ensure the children's physical needs were met.  However, the CBAS assessors describe how, over and above those basic needs, the children also need love, care and commitment, consistent boundary setting and facilitation of their development; but the assessment, at paragraph 264, is that in the parents' case there has been a consistent and persistent inability to provide the levels of parenting that are required for both C and A and their differing needs.  There is an abundance of evidence to suggest that they continued to struggle with setting boundaries for C, maintaining routines for both children, showing emotional warmth, particularly in relation to C, and providing their children with a stable family environment.  Each blames this on the other's parenting style.

 
The assessment, at paragraph 275, is that the parents would not benefit from any further parenting classes.  This is because the parenting classes will not be effective in equipping Mother and Father with the sensitive parenting that their children need.

 
Gladys Chinniandur gave oral evidence to the court.  She was clear that the parents had been assessed both jointly and individually and the recommendation was the same.  They are two emotionally damaged and needy individuals who are parenting their children with little or no insight into their children's needs, because their own needs overwhelm them in the parenting tasks.  Their lack of insight leads to an inability to reflect on their functioning as parents, and this inability is a barrier to change.

 
Of Mother, the assessment paragraph 307 is that she has multiple preoccupations which are enduring features in her life history, and sadly until she can address these work in developing her parenting skills, particularly with regard to building safe and nurturing, emotional relationships with the children, she will, in the view of the CBAS assessors, have little effect.

 
In cross-examination it became clear that there was another aspect of mother's parenting A alone which was not fully addressed in the report.  Reference had been made that Father, who came into C's life when he was three, had said to the assessors that it was he who had potty-trained C and had weaned him off his pushchair.  

 
In her oral evidence, Miss Chinniandur expanded on this to say that she had been told by the parents that Father did all the childcare because Mother needed to rest.  He took the children to the park and played with them.  This was challenged on behalf of mother, it's been suggested that the parents shared the care of the children 50/50, and that Mother would be up in the night caring for A.

 
A has now grown older and she has become more challenging than she was in April 2013 when she was received into foster care.  Even though mother would not have to care for C as well, Miss Chinniandur gave evidence that Mother did not have the capacity to deal with the pressures of A and a new born baby.  She had never cared for either of her children alone.  With C she had had her mother and then Father, and that Father had always been there with A.  Mother needs to show that she can stand on her own two feet, she needs to demonstrate that she can look after herself.  

 
During the last six months Miss Chinniandur said that Mother has not had the care of either child but has not demonstrated that she is able to distance herself from Father, to demonstrate that there is no co-dependency and that she can sustain a separation.

 
Miss Chinniandur also said there were some attachment difficulties between mother and A which had become apparent during the three minute intervention video, when a piece of work was done which demonstrated that there had been minimal stimulation of A by mother.  Although it was recognised by the CBAS assessors that mother has a better relationship with A than she has with C.  It was also said in evidence that Mother had told the assessors that she expected to bond even more with the new baby.

 
I also heard evidence from Lorraine Welch, the current social worker.  Her oral evidence and recommendation mirrored that of the other professionals, and her own observation of contact on the 27th November of 2013 was of a very similar nature to earlier contact.  It was chaotic with an absence of boundaries set for A.  The parents had been asked to bring food for A and brought soup.  When A played with this they laughed at her and did not correct her.  Boundaries were set for C but these were inappropriate and confusing for him.  Father put in place methods learned from 'Triple P' but he did not and has not consistently maintained those methods, which have become confusing for C.

 
It is perhaps not surprising that the foster carers of both children have reported to the LAC reviews, the looked after children reviews, that there has been a noticeable worsening of C and A's behaviour after contact.  A's foster carer has had to turn the television to the wall to stop A switching it on and off, and describes how A will scream when she is told no; behaviours which this experienced foster carer has found challenging.  

 
I also, of course, heard evidence from Sarah Parker, the children's guardian.  She readily accepted in her evidence that the parents' engagement with professionals and cooperation is a positive factor, and that it took courage to agree that C is beyond his mother's capacity to care.  It was also recognised by mother that C's knowledge of his paternity should be handled sensitively, that Father should not tell C that he is not his dad without some preparatory work for C.  

 
However, Miss Parker could not agree that these were steps or building blocks, as they were referred to, upon which a fuller assessment of Mother' parenting skills as a single parent could be explored.  She referred to the extensive work with FABB which demonstrated the parents could, under close supervision, implement better parenting skills, but failed to maintain that change after the support was withdrawn.  

 
Miss Parker drew a distinction between Mother' vocalisation of A as her princess, but her inability to stimulate A or engage with her in the contact environment.  A was described by the guardian as 'Bumbling around, not interacting or playing with the adults or C'.  Miss Parker did not accept this was entirely due to the artificiality of contact, but was more to do with the failure to put in place any structure or boundaries in contact.  

 
For Miss Parker, the failure to engage with the Olive Tree, even through the proceedings, was another significant factor.  Miss Parker comes from a background of mental health and notes how intensive the intervention to effect change in personality disorder is, and she said 'It will be extremely intrusive and distressing work for Mother'; and of course reminded the court that Mother has not even completed the first assessment and there is a very long way to go.

 
Before Miss Parker in fact, I heard evidence from mother, from Mother.  The guardian described Mother as 'wearing her heart on her sleeve' and I would concur with such a description.  Mother was a very open and straight forward witness.  She told the court that she is no longer together with Father, but then went on to describe what they still do together.  They attend contact together on Monday and Wednesday; this is so they have maximum time with their children.  They do not live together but both catch the same bus to and from contact, but from different bus stops.  Father comes to her block of flats frequently because they have mutual friends in the same block, and he helps her by walking the dog.  

 
She explained that she is having his child and so he should help her with her pregnancy, and he has a right to be involved with the unborn child whom she has named L.  He helps financially with baby stuff and he used to give her �10 for the electric.  She said she cannot control the dog while she is pregnant; it is too strong, so Father takes it out.  

 
She told the court she gets on well with his family but she has not seen his mother since before Christmas.  She had her sister, aged 17, to help her and she has friends in her block of flats.  Her main support is from her friends who live in the Tamworth area.  For the first time, in her oral evidence, she spoke of returning to Tamworth and living in a hostel with A and the new baby.  She said she would get an injunction to keep Father away and she will not tell him or his family where they are living.  

 
She described the division of the parenting tasks, when she was with Father, as her caring for A and doing all the night time feeds, and doing school work with C.  She described how, when they were together, it was very chaotic and Father would be a little too strict with C, whereas she herself was too soft and she used to give in to C.  She described how her mother looked after C so A was like a first child for her.  She loves A 110%.  

 
She agreed that the health visitor was concerned about development delay because A could roll over but couldn't pull herself up.  She had not spoken to the health visitor about weaning A but had taken advice from the speech and language therapist who, I understood, had called about twice, one or two occasions, to the home, who she had been referred to because of the tongue-tie.

 
Mother said she had cancelled the appointment with the Olive Tree because she had been in hospital, but had not wanted to cancel the contact because she did not know the outcome of the final hearing.  She knew that she should have separated from Father before, she reported the violent behaviour but she told the court she was not strong enough to end the relationship at the time.  

 
She described how she struggled with C after the FABB team left, describing how her mental health was all over the place.  Her relationship with Father was bad and she had hit rock bottom.  She was very clear, 'I can't cope with C'.  

 
At the time of the CBAS assessment she said that she and Father were still together and she had felt very isolated, she did not want to split up with Father because she loved him, and she thought she owed him something.  She agreed that A had witnessed arguments and that she had been affected by the arguments.  She said that 'This is why A does not react to raised voices'.  Both C and A, she told the court, had been damaged.  She said, 'My children should never have been subjected to domestic violence'.  She described how the incidents were scary for her and would have been petrifying for A.  She agreed that, after, C would cower and be in floods of tears and that A would be jumpy, and she said that that is what she had told the CBAS assessors.

 
She was asked why her friends could not help her with walking the dog rather than Father?  She explained that they have families and it would be dangerous for them to walk the dog.  Similarly, her reason for calling Father to fetch the paracetamol from a high shelf in her flat at night, which she told the guardian about, clearly she could not climb because of the pregnancy, and she said that, again, she could not ask a neighbour to help because they had families.

 
She was later to describe how her relationship with Father had got in the way.  She described how she was in her own little bubble and was not spending time with A, playing with her and stimulating her.  However, now, she was not on medication, she felt brilliant, she was seeing her CPN and also Doctor Kumar every eight weeks.

 
She expected that the children had been affected and that contact was difficult.  She said C had kicked off and screamed in contact, which A had seen, and last week, Mother said, that she had said 'No' to her and that A started to head-bang and scream.  She told the court that this was behaviour that A has learned from C.

 
It was suggested to her that she was taking on too much with A and a new baby, a move to Tamworth and returning to Coventry to undertake the therapy with the Olive Tree, but Mother did not agree, saying that she had to move away to get away from Father.  She also identified her school friends as being a support network.  She clarified her proposal with Miss Mosley, who asked questions on behalf of the guardian.  She did not expect A to come home straight away, she said there would have to be a familiarisation process.  She did not have anywhere for her to go, for example, when she would need to go into hospital for the new baby.  Therefore, A would have to stay in foster care.  

 
She had not mentioned the move to Tamworth to the guardian; she agreed she had not done that.  Father, she said, had been out walking the dog when Miss Parker called round, and that the guardian had been invited to look round her flat.  Mother agrees that the guardian had raised some concerns about the unhygienic state of the bedding, but she said that this had now been changed and she had purchased new bedding.  She told the court that the dog was being rehomed on Sunday.

 
She was able to agree that A needed a permanent home as soon as possible, but in the same breath Mother said that she wanted A back with her on her own, because she believed she can do it, and she asked the court to be given the chance, the opportunity to care for A alone.

 
I turn now to my judgment on the basis of the evidence I have heard.  I have listened very carefully to all the evidence; and I have also read the reports and statements filed.  Father did not give evidence because he does not put himself forward to care for either child and supports Mother in her proposal that A be returned to her care.  In his final statement, his written evidence, he says that he remains separated from Mother, they are no longer in a relationship and he does not live with her at her property.  He is in fact homeless and is not in a position to be a carer for either C or A.  He describes how he would support Mother financially and emotionally if A was returned to her care.  He would like twice weekly contact at a contact centre.  He accepts that there was volatility in their relationship, the arguments and his emotional outbursts affected both children, but rationalises that as they are no longer in a relationship the difficulties that they had in their parenting at the start of the proceedings no longer exist.  It is his belief that it would be safe to return A at least to Mother' care.

 
None of the professionals support such a course and the evidence is overwhelmingly against such a placement being able to meet A's needs.  

 
I have to have regard to the welfare checklist, the particular needs of the child and the effect on the child throughout her life of having ceased to be a member of the original family and becoming an adopted person, the child's age and sex and background, any harm the child is at risk of suffering and the child's relationship with relatives, as of course the plan for A is adoption.  

 
What these children need, and A needs above all else, is a safe and secure home which offers good and nurturing care.  

 
I have to have regard to the threshold criteria and the risk of harm to these children if returned to their parents' care.  I am satisfied that the relationship between the parents is and was one of co-dependency in which each derived benefit.  Father, because he liked to care for Mother and Mother because he supports her emotionally and practically.  However, at the same time it is an unstable and volatile relationship in which, in the past, both parents have lost control of their emotions and their behaviours.  Neither parent was able to meet the emotional needs of their children and both children were exposed to domestic violence.

 
Mother was unable to put her children's needs for a safe and stable home ahead of her desire to remain in a relationship, and she failed to separate from Father.  The children were deeply traumatised and damaged by their experiences, which is now shown in their challenging behaviours.  

 
The professionals, in my judgment, are right on the evidence that I have heard to be sceptical that the parents have indeed separated.  There is clear evidence of an ongoing dependency by Mother which she has been unable to loosen, even when the children are in foster care.  

 
For me, that was highlighted by her calling Father to assist at night when she could not reach a box of paracetamol.  It matters not whether he stayed the night, as she told the guardian, or not, in my judgment it is the clearest pointer that Mother simply cannot function on her own.

 
Mother has not yet addressed her personality disorder, which is deep-rooted in her childhood and early adult experiences.  Until she addresses those very significant problems she will be unable to make the changes necessary to function on her own and to make the fundamental changes to her parenting style.  That is the conclusion of the assessment by CBAS and also of the allocated social workers and both children's guardians appointed within this case.

 
As Mother has only partially engaged with two appointments with the Olive Tree personality disorder service, it has not been possible to assess her capacity to change or to put any timescale on potential progress.  It is a voluntary service and mother needs to engage, but she has failed to do so and has failed for two years.  It is too late and hopelessly outside the children's timescales to say she will go to her appointments two weeks after the final hearing.  

 
I am satisfied that social care have done all within their power to assist and facilitate her attendance, but it was not important to her and other aspects of her life were given greater priority.  This piece of work has not even got off the starting blocks and is a marathon ahead for mother to complete.  This leaves the parents in the very stark and thankless position that the work that they did with FABB so successfully between June and December 2012 has unravelled.  The lessons learned could not be translated into change and improved parenting, and once support was withdrawn, as it inevitably would be because these are short-term intensive interventions to effect change, the parents could not sustain those changes.

 
The children were removed from their care, first C, whose behaviour was the most difficult, but even with the knowledge that C was in foster care the problems remained unchanged.  Domestic violence and inadequate parenting continued, A had to be removed and still changes were not effected.

 
CBAS concludes that until the parents learn to reflect on their parenting styles and make the internal decision to change, any parenting classes will be ineffective.

 
In my judgment the assessments are comprehensive, thorough and cannot be overcome by a very natural but, in the end, hopeless belief that things will be better this time.  There are no family members who have been assessed as capable of caring for either child, and the choice of placements are these: a rehabilitation home to mother, that is not a possibility for C as his behaviours have resulted in a recent change of foster placement because of the disruption he has caused to normal family life.  Mother, to her credit, recognises she does not have the capacity to care long-term for C and supports the local authority care plan.  She understands it is to be adoption, and I am satisfied, having considered the welfare checklist as outlined by the social worker and the guardian, that adoption would give C the best chance of a long-term family placement without continuing statutory involvement.  However, there are risks that such a placement might prove difficult to find because of his age and challenging behaviour.  His new foster placement could be long-term and any further moves are therefore minimised.  

 
Adoption is a serious and irrevocable decision and impacts on the rights of the birth family, but for C it is both just and proportionate.  I am satisfied that placement for adoption is therefore in C's best interest and his welfare now requires that mother's consent be dispensed with if it is not given.

 
A is younger and has had less exposure to her parents' care, but is still showing that she has suffered emotional harm and continues to be exposed to that home in contact.  She now needs a permanent home.  She has been placed away from her family since April 2013.  It is suggested that she should continue in foster care whilst mother adjusts to her new baby and begins the therapeutic journey.  

 
For the reasons I have already given, I am not satisfied that this is even a viable proposition.  Mother has, to date, failed to engage with the Olive Tree, she has not disengaged from her co-dependent relationship.  The changes necessary are fundamental and arise from flaws in her personality, which affect her ability to parent and to make the necessary changes deep-rooted in her.  In all probability mother will continue to avoid appointments and engagement and it will only result in unproductive delay.

 
It is said in closing submissions on behalf of mother that now that she has conceded the case in respect of C, she is better placed to care for A and her unborn baby when she arrives.  Also, it is said that there has been a significant change in that she has separated from Father.  It is argued that by maintaining a civilised friendship this is not indicative of an ongoing intimate relationship and is to be commended.

 
The nature of the concern is not that the parents have maintained a sexual relationship but that they are co-dependent, which prevents either of them from separating with any realistic prospect of maintaining that separation; neither parent desires it, and the relationship therefore persists.  When under pressure Mother turns to her only support, which is of course Father.  

 
C is not the only child with challenging behaviour and I am not satisfied, even without C to care for, that mother is in a position to provide the emotional care that A so desperately needs.

 
In my judgment there is emerging evidence that the behaviours exhibited by C are being repeated in the behaviours shown by A at contact and immediately following contact.  Mother has been unable to put in place strategies to deal with those emerging behaviours, choosing to laugh at A's antics instead of putting in place the boundaries and good parenting practises taught by the FABB team and the nurturing group in respect of C.  Mother recognises her inability to cope with C's behaviour, but is unable to see that A, as she grows up, is becoming more challenging; and that Mother has been unable to develop the skills to meet her changing needs.

 
The CBAS assessment highlighted the very significant parenting which was done by Father, and mother does not recognise that and is unable to identify any support network to replace his input.  Mother delegated the parenting of C to first her mother and then Father, describing herself to the court as a 'First-time parent' with A.  She is simply not equipped to provide that care because she cannot apply the skills taught to her.

 
As the CBAS assessment said, 'She needs to develop the insight to recognise the deficits and to show a willingness to change'.  Although mother expresses a willingness to do anything which is asked of her and who works with the professionals, she does not comprehend, in my judgment, the enormity of the task and has yet to take even the earliest steps.  

 
It is said that there is no assessment of her ability to parent A now that she has separated, but the CBAS assessment assessed both her and Father as a couple, but also the parents as individuals, and there has been ongoing monitoring of Mother' parenting within contact by social care.  Social care has been involved with Mother and the family for many years.  Given the very clear recommendations in the CBAS assessment, sadly I am unable to accede to the submission to give mother the chance to prove she is capable of caring for A and her new born sister.  I have no doubt that mother is genuine in her desire to show she can do it and nobody doubts her love for her children; but I have to make decisions which meet the needs of the children for a secure and safe placement now, and they cannot wait for Mother to develop a new parenting style.  

 
I am satisfied on the evidence that I have heard that sadly it is not the current position that she has made that change to her parenting style.  In my judgment the guardian is right when she says that a decision has to be made for A now.  A will be two in July, the impact of the parents' inability to provide good enough care, as outlined in the threshold document and referred to throughout the evidence, has had a significant impact on A, even in the nine months that she was in the care of Mother and Father.  The evidence of the assessments before the court of professionals involved in mother's life together with the children's guardian, both the previous reports of Miss Brady and the final report of Miss Parker, consistent and cohesive in the concerns identified are preventing the parents providing good enough care.  The parents have not addressed their relationship issues, mother has not begun to address her psychological issues.  The intensive six months with FABB input failed to achieve a safer home for these children.  Both children need a safe and secure permanent home as soon as this is achievable.  The mother cannot provide this in the timescales necessary for either child.  There is no family placement identified as an option for the children.

 
I have considered the care plans and the alternatives of rehabilitation now or in the foreseeable future, and indeed long-term fostering which would maintain the links with the birth family for A.  However, having analysed the evidence I have heard and the recommendations of all professionals, there is only one decision that I can make now, and that is that an adoptive placement must be found as a matter of urgency for A.  Adoption is a placement of last resort where no other course can be taken.  I am satisfied that there is no viable alternative and that a substitute permanent family is in A's best interest.

 
I have regard to the European Convention of Human Rights and the right for respect for family life and in my judgment the care plan of adoption is both just and a proportionate plan in respect of A.  I approve the care plans and make the care orders and placement orders for both children.  The welfare of A, as with C, requires that I dispense with parental consent.

 
End of judgment.

I am concerned with three children. X, a girl born on 6 April 2007. Y, a boy born on 31 May 2008 and Z, a boy born on 19 September 2012. X's parents are F and SH. Y's mother is M. His father is unknown. Z's parents are M and F. X's maternal grandmother is AH. The LA applied for Care orders in relation to all three children.   The children's social worker (SW) is Jim Clayton. The plans for the children proposed by the Local Authority, Bradford Children's Social Care, are that X and Z should be placed with AH under a Special Guardianship Order (SGO) supported by a supervision order and that Y would remain in foster care under a Care Order. The Children's Guardian (CG) is Julie Ross.

 

Parties and representation
The LA is represented by Mr Swiffen. M is represented by Mr Taylor, F is represented by Mr Brown, SH is represented by Ms McCourt and the CG is represented by Ms Kemp.

 
Background
X is now 6 years old.  She is the daughter of F and SH, who went through an Islamic marriage on 14 April 2006. They lived together until 31 October 2008, X remaining with her mother for a couple of months before moving to live with F in December 2008.  In November 2008 there was a s47 enquiry following discovery of marks on X's face and concerns about her being cared for by inappropriate adults. F was granted a residence order in respect of X on 18 March 2009 and she has lived with him in Bradford since then. She has had regular contact with AH, who was assessed as a very positive influence as part of those residence proceedings, and has had some contact with SH. Her half sister, Kr, lives with AH.

 
F started a relationship with M in 2008. M Lived in Humberside, where she remained until June 2013, when she moved to Bradford. F spent some weekends in Humberside with M. She came to Bradford on occasion. At some point before Z was born they had a brief separation. F resumed a sexual relationship with N, a woman who was known to them both. N later claimed that he was the father of her child.

 
On 31 May 2008 M gave birth to Y, who she says that he was conceived as a result of a sexual assault and his father is unknown. Y has significant complex health needs arising from Lissencaphaly. He has no verbal communication or mobility and is completely dependent on others to meet his needs. He is fed through a peg attached to his stomach.  Z was born on 19 September 2012.

 
On 8 October 2012, Hull City Council commenced a core assessment following a referral from Jane Lowther from the Child and Families disability team in June. Ms Lowther said that historically M had been reluctant to work with social services but is now coming to terms that she needs support to manage Y's care needs. The core assessment was completed in November 2012 and recommended no further action.

 
On 19 December 2012 a safeguarding meeting was held in Humberside. An initial assessment was commenced following a referral from an anonymous person who claimed the children were being neglected. The assessment was concluded on 30 January 2013. It concluded that both M and F presented as protective and caring of the children and it was felt that the referral was malicious.

 
In June 2013, M moved from Humberside to Bradford with Y and Z to live with F.

 
Liz Lyles, a nurse, visited the home on 8 July. Y was admitted to hospital. Nurse Lyles was concerned about the chaotic nature of the house and the fact that M was giving food to Y which she believed was contrary to advice. She found it difficult to engage with the family describing them as defensive and aggressive She was also worried about how F treated Y when he had a seizure. Ramadan started in the UK on 9 July.

 
Nurse Lyles visited again on 12 July. She recorded that the parents talked about the family travelling to Iraq by car.

 
On Monday 15 July M and F took Y to see Dr Wood. Nurse Lyles was present. Dr Wood prescribed a Hyoscine patch for Y to help control his dribbling. It was a sunny day and the weather report is that the temperature reached about 24 degrees in the vicinity.

 
On Tuesday 16 July Y had a mark on his buttock. M photographed the mark. M called the community nursing team and spoke with Nurse Farnell.

 
On Wednesday 17 July M spoke by telephone with Nurse Lyles in the morning. Nurse Lyles sought advice from Dr Bargett about holding a professionals meeting to discuss the situation. She also telephoned professionals in Humberside. Nurse Lyles then phoned M and suggested that she take Y to the GP as M described the site as blistered. M refused, but telephoned back to report purple marks around the blister. Nurse Lyles asked Nurse Barrett and Nurse Yaqoob to visit the home which they did. 

 
At that visit the nurses saw a wound on Y's buttock which was described as 10cm x 15 cm in size. The nurses observed that it looked like large blister had formed, burst and the skin had come away. They dressed the wound.

 
 On Thursday 18 July Nurse Yaqoob phoned M and asked her if she had given Y any pain relief. Nurses Yaqoob and Lewis then visited the home and following that visit, where both M and F were present, Y was admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary at 16.16. At 17.00 Y was assessed by Dr Newbegin.

 
Dr Jepps then saw Y at 19.40. Both M and F were present.

 
On Friday 19 July a social worker brought Y's sleep apnoea mat to hospital for Dr Jepps to consider as a potential cause of the lesion. Dr Jepps felt that the pad was unlikely to have caused the lesion and made a referral to the Emergency Duty Team at social services. An initial assessment was started which was completed on 15 August. The LA  then applied for care orders in respect of all 3 children and an interim care order was made on 16 August on the basis of a plan to remove all three children from their parents' care. Y was placed in a specialist foster placement with experienced nurses as his carers. X and Z were placed together in a separate placement.

 
The case was listed for a case management hearing before me on 5th September 2013. I directed that expert's reports were necessary to enable me to determine whether Y had suffered a non accidental injury and if possible to enable me to determine the cause of the injury. Expert evidence was filed by Dr Charles Essex, a Consultant Paediatrician and by Dr Sian Falder, a Burns specialist from Alder Hey Hospital. On 11 November, M filed a statement alleging that the wound may have been caused by Y's apnoea pad, which she described as sometimes becoming too hot to pick up. I authorised that it be tested by Mr Sykes, a Consultant engineer.

 
 Threshold 
Threshold is not accepted by either parent. Mr Taylor submitted on behalf of M that threshold is not crossed because the injury is not a burn and it cannot be ascribed to inadequate parenting. F's position was slightly different. His Counsel submitted that whilst F does not concede that the injury is a burn, he had said in his witness statement that "�I have to agree that it seems more likely than not that the injury sustained by Y is indeed a burn" Both parents sought to be excluded as the perpetrator of any non accidental injury to Y.

 
Issues for determination
 At the commencement of the case the parties were agreed that the main issue is whether the lesion to Y's buttock was caused by:

 

An allergic reaction to a Hyoscine patch



A burn caused by an overheating apnoea pad



Scalded skin syndrome



A thermal burn



An unknown cause


Mr Taylor conceded in his closing submissions that the lesion could not be caused by the apnoea mat or the Hyoscine patch. Both M and F in their oral evidence repeated the view that the patch could be a cause and M suggested that there were other pads, not tested, which may have heated up. The issues should therefore be considered by the court.

 
 A subsidiary question was whether I have sufficient expert evidence to determine causation or whether I should adjourn the case to enable the instruction of a Consultant Dermatologist to report on whether the lesion was caused by scalded skin syndrome or some other cause. 

 
In the event that I do not adjourn and I find that the lesion was caused by a thermal burn the issues which then arise for determination are:

 

Was the burn caused accidentally or non accidentally?



If it was an accident is threshold crossed?



Was the burn caused by contact with a hot surface, either by Y being placed on the surface or a hot object being placed on Y?



If the cause was a contact burn was it inflicted upon Y?



If so, is it possible to identify who injured Y?



If it is possible to identify who injured Y did the other parent know and collude with the perpetrator or were they unaware.



In the event that I find that the lesion was caused by a non disclosed accidental injury what is the future risk to Y, X and Z? Can they be returned to their parents or are there other risk factors which should be considered, including the alleged failure to obtain medical treatment and/ or administer pain relief?

 
In the event that I find that the lesion is a non accidental injury caused by one parent and that the other parent was unaware should there be a further assessment and if so by whom of whom and on what basis?

 
In the event that I find that the lesion is a non accidental injury caused by one or both of the parents and I am unable to identify the perpetrator should the case be adjourned for further assessment and if so by whom of whom and on what basis?

 
In the event that I find that the lesion is a non accidental injury caused by one or both of the parents and I am unable to identify the perpetrator and I determine that the case should not be adjourned where should each child live and which orders are in the best interests of each child?

 
Law
Statutory framework � Care orders and Special Guardianship orders
The threshold to there being a jurisdiction to make public law orders is that set out in the criteria of s.31(2) of the Children Act 1989.  In this case it is not accepted on the parent's behalf that these criteria are satisfied.  If I am satisfied that they are met on the evidence then, and only then, can I then go on to consider whether to make a care or supervision order. In order to do so I must consider the welfare of each child and apply the well-known provisions of s.1 of the Act, which also applies to making a Special Guardianship Order (SGO). This is not a public law order and so the threshold criteria do not have to be met for me to consider making an SGO

 
Section 1(1) provides that when determining any question with respect to the upbringing of a child, that child's welfare shall be the court's paramount consideration.  In determining what is in a child's best welfare interests the court is to have regard to each of the factors set out in the welfare checklist in s.1(3).  Section 1(5) provides that when considering whether or not to make an order under the Act with respect to a child, a court shall not make the order unless it considers that doing so would be better for her than making no order at all. 

 
 I am also bound to be mindful to the requirement to have regard to the general principle, set out in s.1(2), that any delay in concluding these proceedings is likely to prejudice the welfare of the children.

 

Burden and Standard of Proof
The burden of proving any fact in dispute rests on the party asserting it.  The standard to which it is to be so proved is the simple balance of probabilities, no more and no less.

 
In relation to the task of proving a future risk, I note the words of Baroness Hale in Re J (Care Proceedings: Possible Perpetrators):

 
[49] Having adopted a flexible test of likelihood, it became all the more important to hold that an objective factual basis was required from which to draw the inference that future harm was likely.  This was controversial in Re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) but has been firmly established ever since and for very good reasons. Care courts are often told that the best predictor of the future is the past.  But prediction is only possible where the past facts are proved.  A real possibility that something has happened in the past is not enough to predict that it will happen in the future.  It may be the fact that a judge has found that there is a real possibility that something has happened.  But that is not sufficient for this purpose. A finding of a real possibility that a child has suffered harm does not establish that he has.  A finding of a real possibility that the harm which a child has suffered is 'non-accidental' does not establish that it was.  A finding of a real possibility that this parent harmed a child does not establish that she did.  Only a finding that he has, it was, or she did, as the case may be, can be sufficient to found a prediction that because it has happened in the past the same is likely to happen in the future. Care courts need to hear this message loud and clear.

From the outset of my hearing this case I have reminded myself that an allegation of non-accidental injury should not be based solely on the premise that the parents cannot explain the causation of the injury.

 
I have reminded myself of the case of Re AA (A Child) [2012] EWHC 2647, where Mr Justice Baker gave a very helpful summary of the law.  He started off by referring to the words of Baroness Hale of Richmond in Re: B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35, where she said: 

 
"The likelihood of harm is the prediction from existing facts or from a multitude of such facts about what had happened in the past, about the characters and personalities of the people involved and the things which they have said or done,"
Baker J went on to address the burden and standard of proof.  The burden of proof lies with the Local Authority.  It is the Local Authority that brings these proceedings and identifies the findings that they invite the court to make, although of course it is open to me to investigate or make other findings if that is appropriate.  The burden of proving the allegations rests with the Local Authority and to that extent the fact finding component of care proceedings remains essentially adversarial.  The court has an important discretion as to the ambit of the inquiry, and in this era of greater judicial case management is under a greater obligation to ensure that only the relevant issues are litigated, but that does not alter the basic principle that the burden of proof rests with the Local Authority. 

 
In Re S-B (Children) (Perpetrator: Non-accidental Injury) [2009] UKSC 17 Baroness Hale stated "The first question listed in the statement of facts and issues is whether it is now settled law that the test to be applied to the identification of perpetrators is the balance of probabilities. The parties are agreed that it is and they are right" 

 
She developed this theme in Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35 when she said :

 
"The decisions  In re H, Lancashire County Council v B, and In re O fit together as a coherent whole. The court must first be satisfied that the harm or likelihood of harm exists. Once that is established, as it was in both the Lancashire and Re O cases, the court has to decide what outcome will be best for the child. It is very much easier to decide upon a solution if the relative responsibility of the child's carers for the harm which she or another child has suffered can also be established. But the court cannot shut its eyes to the undoubted harm which has been suffered simply because it does not know who was responsible. The real answers to the dilemma posed by those cases lie elsewhere - first, in a proper approach to the standard of proof, and second, in ensuring that the same judge hears the whole case. Split hearings are one thing; split judging is quite another." 
Lord Hoffman observed : 

 
"If a legal rule requires the facts to be proved, a judge must decide whether or not it happened.  There is no room for a finding that it might have happened.  The law operates a binary system in which the only values are nought and one."  
Baroness Hale continued: 

 
"In our legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place.  If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place.  He is not allowed to sit on the fence.  He has to find for one side or the other.  Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue.  The party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did, but generally speaking, a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely on the burden of proof." 
Accidental or non accidental injury
In some cases it is simply not possible to say what has happened to a child or what has caused an injury.  In the case of Re: R (Care proceedings: Causation) [2011] EWHC 1715 Hedley J stated:

 
"In my judgment a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither professional nor forensic failure.  It simply recognises that we still have much to learn and it also recognises that it is dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury merely from the absence of any other understood mechanism.  Maybe it simply represents a general acknowledgement that we are fearfully and wonderfully made."
Findings of fact in these types of cases must be based on evidence and I should be careful to avoid speculation.  I must take into account all the evidence and consider each piece of evidence in the context of all the other evidence.  As Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss observed in Re: T [2004] EWCA Civ 558

 
"Evidence cannot be evaluated and assessed in separate compartments.  A judge in these difficult cases must have regard to the relevance of each piece of evidence to the other evidence and exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to the conclusion of whether the case put forward by the Local Authority has been made out to the appropriate standard or not."
It is also important for the court to judge the causation of an injury in context, as Ryder J observed in A County Council v A Mother and Others in 2005:

 
"A factual decision must be based on all available materials, be judged in context and not just upon medical or scientific materials, no matter how cogent they may in isolation seem to be."
 In A County Council and K, D and L [2005] EWHC 144, Charles J said at paragraph 49:

 
"In a case where the medical evidence is to the effect that the likely cause is non-accidental and thus human agency, a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence that either a) on the balance of probability an injury has a natural cause or it is not a non-accidental injury; or b) that a local authority has not established the existence of the threshold to the civil standard of proof.  The other side of the coin of course is that in a case where the medical evidence is that there is nothing diagnostic of non-accidental injury of human agency and the clinical observation of the child, although consistent with non-accidental injury or human agency of the type asserted more usually associated with accidental injury or infection a court can reach a finding on the totality of the evidence that on the balance of probability there has in fact been a non-accidental injury or human agency as asserted and the threshold is established."

Pool of perpetrators
In a case of this type where there is more than one person who could be responsible for a non accidental injury it is necessary to identify the pool of perpetrators. In North Yorkshire CC v SA [2003] EWCA Civ 839 the child had suffered non-accidental injury on two occasions. Four people had looked after the child during the relevant time for the more recent injury and a large number of people might have been responsible for the older injury. The Court of Appeal held that the judge had been wrong to apply a "no possibility" test when identifying the pool of possible perpetrators. This was far too wide. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss P, at para 26, preferred a test of a "likelihood or real possibility" that A or B or C was the perpetrator or a perpetrator of the inflicted injuries". In this case both M and F concede that they were looking after Y at the relevant time and that nobody else could have inflicted the injury whether accidentally or not. 

 
Authorities have made it clear that wherever possible the court should identify the person who has caused or inflicted the injury, but it is important not to strain the evidence. In Re S-B (Children) (Perpetrator: Non-accidental Injury) [2009] UKSC 17 

 
In Lancashire CC v B [2000] 2 AC 147 the House of Lords was concerned with the proper interpretation of the second part of the threshold test, the "attributability" criterion in section 31(2)(b). A seven-month-old baby had suffered injury from having been violently shaken on at least two occasions. Care proceedings were brought in relation to that child and also in relation to the child of a child-minder who looked after the injured child during working hours. The judge found that the injuries had been caused either by the mother, or by the father, or by the child-minder, but he could not identify the perpetrator. He concluded that the threshold criteria were not met in respect of either child, but the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords held that they were met in respect of the injured child. The House held that it was not necessary, for the purpose of section 31(2)(b), to make a finding that an individual parent whose parental responsibility would be curtailed by the order was responsible for the harm suffered. It was enough that the harm was attributable to the care given to the child not being what it ought to have been and this referred principally to the primary carers

 

First principles
In Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 a strong Court of Appeal (comprising the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Family Division and Black LJ) provided a comprehensive review of the law in respect of cases where a non-consensual adoption is in contemplation.   The judgment went far beyond the narrow question of the proper application of section 47(5) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. It set out, consolidated and reinforced a number of fundamental matters of the greatest importance.  In particular the court took the opportunity to consider the implications of the decision of the Supreme Court in In re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria [2013]. 

 
The President reminded all judges that "it is necessary for us to go back to first principles and to emphasise a number of essential considerations that judges must always have in mind, and we emphasise this, at every stage of the process."  I have borne these principles (which I set out below) in my mind through every stage of this case, involving as it does the plan for the children to be placed away from M and F, albeit in the wider family for X and Z.

 
 I must, and I do pay the closest regard - and in relation both to M and F and the children and to the rights of each pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  In the context of public law family proceedings, the overarching principle remains as explained by Hale LJ, as she then was, in Re C and B (Care Order: Future Harm) [2001] 1FLR 611 at 34 as follows:

 
"Intervention in the family may be appropriate, but the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that, and the effort should be devoted towards that end. Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child or children and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child.
It was as long ago as 1988 that Lord Brandon identified in Re KD (A Minor) (Access: Principles)[1988] AC 806 that:
� the best person to bring up a child is the natural parent.  It matters not whether the parent is wise or foolish, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, provided the child's moral and physical health are not endangered.  Public Authorities cannot improve on nature. Public authorities exercise a supervisory role and interfere to rescue a child when the parental tie is broken by abuse or separation.
The Least Interventionist Approach
S.1(5) of the Children Act 1989 in conjunction with the notions of proportionality derived from or at least set out in the European jurisprudence, means that the level of state intervention should be no greater than is necessary in order to secure the child's welfare.  Honouring the Article 8 rights both of M and F and of the children requires me to arrive at an outcome which is both proportionate and in the children's best welfare interests.

 
As Hale J, as she then was, said in Re O (Care or Supervision Order) [1996] 2 FLR 755, 760: 

 
"the court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach.  This should be considered to be in the better interests of the children � unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary." [�]
Implicit in all this are three important points emphasised by Lord Neuberger in Re B. First (paras 77, 104), although the child's interests in an adoption case are paramount, the court must never lose sight of the fact that those interests include being brought up by the natural family, ideally by the natural parents, or at least one of them, unless the overriding requirements of the child's welfare make that not possible. 

 
Second (Re B para 77), as required by section 1(3)(g) of the 1989 Act and section 1(6) of the 2002 Act, the court "must" consider all the options before coming to a decision.  As Lady Hale said (para 198) it is "necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions".  What are these options?  That will depend upon the circumstances of the particular cases.  They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to the making of an adoption order at the other.  In between, there may be orders providing for the return of the child to the parent's care with the support of a family assistance order or subject to a supervision order or a care order; or the child may be placed with relatives under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order; or the child may be placed with someone else, again under a residence order or a special guardianship order or in a foster placement under a care order.  

 
Third ...Re B para 105), the court's assessment of the parents' ability to discharge their responsibilities towards the child must take into account the assistance and support which the authorities would offer. So "before making an adoption order � the court must be satisfied that there is no practical way of the authorities (or others) providing the requisite assistance and support." In this connection it is worth remembering what Hale LJ had said in Re O (Supervision Order) [2001] EWCA Civ 16, [2001] 1 FLR 923, para 28: 

 
"It will be the duty of everyone to ensure that, in those cases where a supervision order is proportionate as a response to the risk presented, a supervision order can be made to work, as indeed the framers of the Children Act 1989 always hoped that it would be made to work. The local authorities must deliver the services that are needed and must secure that other agencies, including the health service, also play their part, and the parents must co-operate fully."
That was said in the context of supervision orders but the point is of wider application. [�]
Sufficiency of Evidence and Analysis
The Court of Appeal has recently stressed the requirement for cogent, reasoned evidence and analysis.  This is summarised, consolidated and enhanced in Re B-S:

 
34. [T]here must be proper evidence both from the local authority and from the guardian. The evidence must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option. As Ryder LJ said in Re R (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1018, para 20, what is required is: 
"evidence of the lack of alternative options for the children and an analysis of the evidence that is accepted by the court sufficient to drive it to the conclusion that nothing short of adoption is appropriate for the children."
The same judge indicated in Re S, K v The London Borough of Brent [2013] EWCA Civ 926, para 21, that what is needed is:
"An assessment of the benefits and detriments of each option for placement and in particular the nature and extent of the risk of harm involved in each of the options".
McFarlane LJ made the same point in Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, para 48, when he identified:
"the need to take into account the negatives, as well as the positives, of any plan to place a child away from her natural family".
And (Re B-S) "In most child care cases a choice will fall to be made between two or more options. The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option. 
The linear approach � is not apt where the judicial task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for the child's future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare.
We need not quote the next paragraph in McFarlane LJ's judgment, which explains in graphic and compelling terms the potential danger of adopting a linear approach. 
44. We emphasise the words "global, holistic evaluation". This point is crucial. The judicial task is to evaluate all the options, undertaking a global, holistic and (see Re G para 51) multi-faceted evaluation of the child's welfare which takes into account all the negatives and the positives, all the pros and cons, of each option. To quote McFarlane LJ again (para 54): 
"What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options."

Final Care Plan and parties' positions 
The final care plan for X and Z is to place them together with AH, who is X's  maternal grandmother, under a Special Guardianship Order. They would have monthly contact with their parents, supervised by the local authority, and regular contact with Y.

 
The final care plan for Y is for him to remain in foster care subject to a final care order. It is proposed that he remain in his current specialist placement  and have monthly contact with his parents and additional contact with his siblings. The Children's Guardian supports the care plans. The parents oppose them.

 
Evidence
I heard the evidence of Dr Charles Essex, Consultant Neurodevelopmental paediatrician, Dr Sian Falder,Consultant Burns, Plastic and Reconstructive surgeon, Jim Clayton, the current social worker, Dr Jepps, Consultant paediatrician, David Perkins, a social worker involved in taking a history from M and F and from M, F and F's friend MG and the Children's Guardian, Julie Ross. I also had an extensive bundle of written evidence. This included viability assessments of those put forward by the parents as alternative carers, the parents themselves and SH, the parties statements, the unchallenged written evidence of Liz Lyles, palliative care nurse, Samantha Barrett, Julie Yaqoob and Daniellle Lewis, Children's Community nurses. The documentation also includes medical reports and records of treating physicians and assessments from Humberside City Council, together with medical and social work records.

 
Dr Essex explained that Y is 5 years old and has global developmental difficulties which mean that he functions at the level of a young baby. He makes some noises and moves "a fraction" but cannot move intentionally and requires 24 hour assistance and care for all his needs. The condition is life shortening, and there is a particular risk of aspiration and infection. 

 
Dr Essex gave evidence that scalded skin syndrome (sss) is caused by staphylococcus infection causing the skin layers to break down and blister. He said that he comes across sss once or twice a year, maybe having seen over 60 cases in total, and is able to give expert evidence on this aspect of paediatric dermatology because he had a particular interest in skin conditions and had undertaken dermatological training and read up on the area. He said that immuno depressed children are susceptible to sss but even in children with cancer the condition is uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus is present on many people's skin so the presence on Y's swabs taken on 18, 19 and 25 July 2013 was unremarkable in his view.

 
In Dr Essex's view it is important to note that Y was not significantly unwell when he was in hospital. He was not given intravenous antibiotics which would have been an indicator of greater infection and was given oral treatment by his peg feeding site which indicates lower infection than sss infection. Further, the site of the lesion did not spread, which he would have expected in over half cases of sss  and the skin did not recover reasonably quickly when Y was treated. When he saw Y a month after admission to hospital the lesion had not healed, whereas sss would have been "significantly improved".

 
Finally, he stated that in most of the cases of sss which he had seen there were several blisters, although he had seen some cases with just one.

 
Dr Essex gave evidence that the shape of the wound was significant because it had a linear edge and he had not seen sss blisters like that. The straight edges to the blister in his opinion made it much more likely to be caused mechanically. He had therefore concluded that sss was "highly unlikely" to have caused the lesion. He stressed that the treating physicians would be very alive to sss even though it is unusual

 
Dr Essex described the lesion as "pretty sizeable" and said that any 5 year old who could communicate would complain. With Y, Dr Essex felt that Y would cry and whenever he was moved the injury would hurt. He said of the injury "It was self evidently likely to cause pain. A carer would go to the doctor not just because of the way it looked but also because of its size, the pain it would cause and the need for treatment".

 
 Dr Essex agreed with the opinion of Dr Falder that the Hyoscine patch could not cause the injury. He did not defer to her opinion because, he said, he had great experience of children with disability and the use of Hyoscine patches. He said that the patches are roughly the size of a thumbnail and they occasionally cause skin to go red. The patch was placed on the neck, nowhere near the buttock lesion and he said it could not therefore cause the injury in question.

 
Asked by Mr Taylor whether liquid in a nappy could cause a straight line lesion Dr Essex said that modern nappies are very efficient and that urine is not of itself going to cause a burn. He distinguished nappy rash as more irritant than causing a breakdown of the skin as witnessed on Y. Even a "high tide" of urine would not explain the shape of the injury which Dr Essex felt was caused by something pressed against the skin or which had skin pressed against it.

 
Asked about unknown aetiology Dr Essex stated that there was nothing in the microbiology results which indicated an infection, although Y is prone to chest infections. He said that there are no retrospective tests which can show sss, and that the antibiotics given to Y were not, in his opinion, administered for sss but for a developing chest problem. He advised that a dermatological opinion at this stage could add little, and opined that the hospital had mentioned sss as a possibility because it is a very remote possibility and would be wrong not to consider it. When looked at holistically however he ruled it out  and felt that the most likely cause was a thermal burn due to the timing and the straight edges of the lesion.

 
Dr Falder stated that Mr Phipps, a treating physician saw Y's wound some 14 days after admission and had considered whether it had been caused by a hot flat object, hot liquid or pooled urine. Of these possibilities a contact burn was possible because the lesion had a well defined edge which is common because the object is uniformly hot so the burn takes the shape of the object. The subsequent healing time was also consistent with a thermal burn because the burn was deep and had taken well over a month to show significant signs of healing. 

 
Dr Falder's evidence was that a contact burn tends to be deeper than a scald and this was a deeper burn. She said as a rough guide a shallow (first degree) burn takes a couple of weeks to heal but a deeper burn, whether 2nd degree with burning of the dermis or third degree where the burn is down to the fatty tissue takes much longer.  In her view the photographs from which she came to her opinion demonstrated a shallow second degree burn which will scar, be very red and possible quite raised. She felt that a contact burn was more likely in Y's case because of the straight edge and appearance of a corner. There was a clear burnt/ non burnt demarcation on Y's buttock, especially in the early photographs. She had raised the possibility of the implement being an iron but the demarcation of the injury is such that she said "it is difficult to describe the implement". Dr Falder was asked why she favoured the view that this was a contact burn when the treating physician, Mr Phipps, had considered other types of causation. She responded that he was not asked for an opinion as to likely cause but was noting the differential diagnoses. His opinion was on an entirely different basis to that of her expert opinion. Although Dr Falder had not seen the acute stage of the injury she said that the large range of photographs available demonstrated features which might be missed in a clinical setting when the emphasis is on treatment.

 
When asked about the likely length of exposure to a hot surface Dr Falder explained that the depth of a burn depends on the temperature and the length of time exposed. She sees a great deal of burns which are caused in a second or so by contact with an iron, a hob or hair straighteners and accepted that a cooler temperature where there is longer exposure could cause the same burn. She was clear that the deep heat cream used by F could not cause a burn.

 
Dr Falder gave evidence that the timing of this lesion was difficult because there was no history. The original photos of Y taken by his mother showed an injury which was fresh and likely to be less than 24 hours old. On 15 July there was no injury. On 16 July at 2am there is a red mark noticed, which was consistent with a fresh burn, therefore Dr Falder felt that the known history supported her timing of the injury. She was very clear that timing of burns is an inexact science.

 
She stated that the Hyoscine patch on Y's neck could not cause a burn in another part of his body and that the sleep apnoea mat could not have caused the burn because it is cold and cannot heat up. 

 
Dr Falder has seen possibly 2 cases of sss in 15 years. She was not surprised that the swab taken from Y had grown staphylococcus aureus because it is present on human skin. There was insufficient data to know whether the bacterium was the type to cause the toxin which causes skin breakdown in sss. She said "I see a lot of children with staphylococcus on their skin and they don't get sss. A child with sss will have widespread inflammation and will be quite sick". She deferred to Dr Essex's view on sss as she said that it would be a paediatrician who would diagnose it, possibly with a dermatologist.

 
Dr Falder gave evidence that she did not criticise M for calling nurses rather than taking Y to the GP unless M had known that this was a contact burn and was serious.

 
Dr Jepps, a Consultant Paediatrician who had treated Y and had the opportunity to examine the injury gave evidence. She said that she had considered a range of differential diagnoses but that the instant impression was that this was a burn from contact with a hot object because there were straight lines and clearly demarcated corners. She had ruled out liquid as the cause because that would not be a straight line injury.

 
Dr Jepps gave evidence that she had considered infection as a potential cause of the lesion. She had considered sss which can present either as a rapid spread or a localised injury. She had seen about 3 or 4 cases of the rapidly spreading presentation and about 15 cases of the localised presentation. She always has staphylococcus aureus in her mind so that she doesn't miss sss. In Y's case she was clear that he did not have sss. He did not have a raised temperature, increased heartbeat, he wasn't clammy to the touch or generally unwell and the lesion's straight edges were not typical to the sss lesions she has seen. Dr Jepps stated that if she had been concerned with a possible sss case she would have taken blood to test and given intravenous fluxocillin. 

 
Dr Jepps had considered whether the lesion could have been caused by urine because the weather was hot. She had seen children who had been left 14 or 15 hours in urine but the effect was "nothing like this". She felt that if he'd been left for a couple of days in very hot weather a 'burn' might have occurred but since M and F were clear that Y was changed every 4 hours that could not be the cause. F had told her that he had changed Y at 8pm on 15 July. He said this with M present and she had not challenged what he had said. Whilst the parents had been upset and had spoken very quickly Dr Jepps said she had been careful to ascertain who was saying what and it was clearly F who was saying that he had changed Y at 8pm. The time had come from him and had not been suggested by her. She said that F had been clear that it was 8pm not 8am because it was after Y had been taken to the GP and had had the Hyoscine patch prescribed.

 
 Dr Jepps was aware that Mr Phipps had also queried a urine cause, but they had not discussed it. 

 
Dr Jepps had also considered the apnoea mat and any hot objects around the house. She believed that a flat surface was unlikely to make such a mark because of the corners she observed. 

 
Jim Clayton, the current social worker, did not use an interpreter in his conversations with F. He said that although F's English is heavily accented his grasp of the language is "not too bad" and F speaks in English to all the children, M and X's mother.

 
Mr Clayton gave evidence that the overall picture of the couple's parenting is good, and there has historically been a fairly positive view of them as parents. Although there had been some conflict with health professionals, especially the ward staff when Y was admitted, he had had full cooperation with the family. He said that the risk to all the children was unmanageable if placed with M and F because he did not know how the burn had been caused and what triggers there may be to such a serious injury. He did not feel that it was likely to be deliberately inflicted and said that the most likely cause in his mind was that it was an accident. He had gone through all the possibilities of accidental causes with M and F, who, he said, had remained consistent in saying that the Hyoscine patch had caused the burn, and felt that they had ample opportunity to tell him what had happened. The care plans for the children were based on a finding of non accidental injury to Y and a high level of risk as a result to all three children as a result.

 
He described M as a "fierce advocate for Y" and that she had strong views about him being cared for at home rather than in respite care or in a hospice towards the end of his life. He had seen M handling Y and did not have any issues about her handling which was confident and firm. He was aware that others on the ward felt that M was too rough.

 
Mr Clayton had considered whether the risk could be managed by putting in the intensive support team to help the parents but this would be of limited duration and since nothing was accepted as deficient by the parents there was little to work with. He said "They can't be there 24/7 monitoring the situation". He had considered whether it was possible to return X and Z to the parents but felt that the risk was severe to all 3 children. He accepted that Y attending school in future would be a protective factor and that Y is monitored consistently by professionals because of his condition.

 
Mr Clayton gave evidence that Y's current carers are being assessed as long term carers and it is likely Y would stay there in the longer term. He said that caring for Y is a "massive task" and that M had shown dedication in the way that she had cared for him. Y has a life limiting condition and both M and F worked as a team to care for him. He said that he was sure Y would want to be with them if it were safe, and that there were limitations to foster care even of the very high standard he is currently receiving.

 
Mr Brown suggested to Mr Clayton that it is important to balance Y's quality of life with the quantity of his life. The social worker agreed that whilst M may be prepared to take a small risk of infection by giving Y 'tasters' of food so that he could enjoy the experience, a professional foster carer could not act in such a way. He gave assurances to the court that M and F would continue to be involved in end of life planning for Y and in any significant medical decisions, rather than leaving the decision making to the foster carers. He had not spoken with the foster carers about how they would keep M and F informed of medical appointments and decisions. When asked about Y's current end of life plan he said "I don't know the plan but there is one in place. I'm not aware that it's been discussed with M".

 
Mr Clayton acknowledged that the starting point is always to keep siblings together, which would be possible if all three were returned to M and F but was not possible on the LA plans because AH could not care for Y. He said that contact would take place and that "�balancing the risk it's the best we can do".

 
Mr Clayton's assessment of AH was that she had had a reasonable relationship with F in the past, and has had good contact with X and Z. In his view they could move to her "in a matter of days".

 
Mr Sheikh, the initial assessment social worker, gave evidence that he had attended the hospital on 19 July to complete the initial assessment. He spoke with F and his colleague spoke with M. He took handwritten notes of the conversation which was conducted in English. He was happy to proceed without an interpreter although he was aware that English is not F's first language. Mr Sheikh said that F may struggle with complex English, for example technical terms, but his conversational language skills were good enough to describe the history of events. He said "He answered the questions and I understood his answers. I don't recall him using words like 'maybe'. He stated that F converses with M and the children in English. F had told him that he had seen the mark for the first time at 8pm on 15 July. 

 
Mr Perkins, who was also one of the initial social work team, gave evidence that he had spoken with both M and F together and separately about the events of 15 July. He had coincidentally met F in 2011 in relation to other proceedings. He recognised him when he saw him. Both in 2011 and in 2013 he had spoken to F without an interpreter. In 2013 he had asked F if he would like an interpreter present and he said no. Mr Perkins said that in general he was confident that they had communicated well and that F had wanted to talk. He said: "If he hadn't wanted to talk we wouldn't have had such extensive notes!" He had not met with Mr Sheikh or spoken to him about the case. Mr Brown suggested to him that communication can't have been so good because he had noted that F had said he had cleaned a baby's bottom with his tongue. Mr Perkins said he had been very surprised when F had said that but that it was metaphorical which is why he had used the phrase "lost in translation". Mr Perkins said he was aware that M had said they had gone to Leeds that day but F had not, and he was trying to clarify the chronology. 

 
M gave evidence that she is pregnant. She said that she has been in a relationship with F for a long time but initially she lived in Humberside and he lived in Bradford. They met in 2008 through an internet dating site. She thought Y was about 3 months old at the time. Y's father was Kurdish and F is Kurdish but she said that she had not met F before.

 
She said that F would come across for weekends and they had eventually decided to live together, following which she had moved to Bradford in June 2013. They had obtained a house across the street from F's home and the plan was for them all to live together at some point. In 2012 they had spent most of the summer and most weekends together. M said that she trusts F with the care of all the children, including Y, and that they had settled into a routine. She said that they speak English at home but she does have to repeat some things. 

 
The normal routine is that F would take X to school and when he returned he would start to deal with Y and Z whilst M remained in bed until 10am. F would prepare breakfast. The couple would share the cooking. Generally F would put the children to bed unless he was going out which happened 2 or 3 times per week. M said that she doesn't sleep properly, often not going to sleep until 5 am when she has gone to bed at midnight. She listens to the radio. She said that whilst F does much of the daytime care for the children she undertakes the overnight care, listening out for Y on his baby monitor and checking the nappies 2 or 3 times after midnight. She felt that Y preferred F to undertake tasks such as showering him.

 
On 15 July a friend had taken X to school and the family were up early because Y was going to the GP. F drove them to see Dr Woods who had examined him without his nappy. When they returned to the car it was hot so M opened the windows and doors to cool it down. She said that when they got into the car it was cool enough. It was close to dinner time when they left the hospital and they had been in the car park for a "good" 45 minutes. In cross examination M said that in fact it had taken about 10-15 minutes for the car to cool. 

 
M said that F drove to his friends shop. He went into the shop and she stayed in the car with Y and Z. In his absence M changed and fed both children. She laid Y on the back seat to change him. M denied that she was unhappy at being left outside the shop with the children in the car on a hot day for a long time. Mr Swiffen stated that M's statement had suggested that she had gone into the shop. She said that it may have been F who had told her that his friend was in the shop and said "I wasn't fully happy. I was a little bit cross. I didn't say anything while the kids were there." Mr Swiffen asked her why she thought F had initially said that they hadn't visited anyone that day. She replied "Maybe he forgot or he didn't have chance to see his cousin." He also asked her why F had said she had come into the shop if she had stayed in the car. She said that she must have forgotten. 

 
M raised the possibility that the heat in the car may have caused the injury. Mr Swiffen asked her if she had any worries at the time about the heat of the car seat would she have laid Y on it and she said that she would not. She said he was on the seat for a very short time and the windows in the rear of the car are dark glass which keeps the sun out.

 
Mr Swiffen asked M what they were doing between 1.30pm and 3.45pm as the time was unaccounted for. M responded that the traffic may have meant that the journey had taken longer on that day.

 
M stated that because they would be too late to pick X up from school she had asked a friend to pick her up. When they got home F had stayed there about 20 minutes and then had gone out at some time between 5pm and 6pm.

 
When questioning F, Mr Swiffen suggested that F had been clear with several people, including Dr Jepps, Mr Sheikh, Miss Nicholson and Mr Perkins that he had changed Y's nappy at 8pm on 15 July. F said "There might have been a misunderstanding. I didn't quite understand and in addition I was out that evening to visit a friend. I didn't ask what date they were asking me about". 

 
 When asked by Ms Kemp what X had had for her tea, M could not recall. She said that Y was put in his "peapod" seat in the living room where he stayed until about 6pm. There was no heat source in the room where Y was and she filled the paddling pool with water for X. She supervised X and Z in the pool and gave Y some juice at about 6pm. He remained there until about 8pm when she had given him his milk and his medication and completed his exercises and a nappy change. M stated that she put Z to bed at about 7.30 and X and Y to bed at about 8 pm. She said "I took him (Y) up. He was fine". She thought she had checked him again at 10pm and midnight.

 
Mr Swiffen asked F why he had told Mr Sheikh that he had noticed some redness when he changed Y's nappy at 8pm. He said that he had not said that but in fact had said that he had not seen it until 2am. Any references to changing Y at 8pm that evening were misinterpretations of the fact that he said he would generally change Y's nappy at 8pm. Mr Swiffen also asked F why he had said he had seen redness to Y's bottom when he took Y out of the peapod to which he replied "I didn't mean his bottom. I meant his tummy which was sore."

 
F said that he had taken the children in from the car, had a short rest and then gone out. He had been to the barbers and to a restaurant where he had seen friends and had a meal. It was Ramadan but he had dropped his fast that day and when he had left the restaurant at about 10pm he had taken two friends home and called to see his friend Mohammed who was drinking alcohol before going home after midnight.

 
Mr Swiffen pointed out that until the care proceedings started F had been clear with everyone that he had been in all night and had cared for Y but that this had changed to going out once the proceedings were issued. F said that he had installed more CCTV cameras when the proceedings started and had then tried to remember what had happened.

 
Mr Swiffen asked M why she had said she had bathed Y in her statement. She said "I might have said that but I didn't", and then said that in fact she might have bathed him but she was really tired. Mr Swiffen asked M why F had initially said that he had changed Y at 8pm and had later changed his story to say that he had gone out. M suggested that F may have been confused.

 
M told me that F had returned at about half past midnight. She said that when F came home he did not come straight to bed. There are baby monitors in each room of the house and she heard him make a cup of tea and she could hear Y gurgling happily. When F came to bed at about 2am "�he possibly said something about Y's bottom but it didn't register really. He said he had put Sudocreme on it." She said that she didn't ask him about the mark. Mr Swiffen suggested that that was because she was aware of the mark already. She denied that. She said that the next day was just a normal day. F took X to school and returned to sort Y out at which time he called her to come downstairs because he had seen something. He said it was worse than last night.

 
M stated that when she saw the mark in the morning she rang the medical team for advice. Mr Swiffen asked her why she had told them that this was a reaction to the Hyoscine patch � which was on his neck � when in fact he had a blistered bottom. M said that she couldn't tell the team that it was a burn because she didn't know that it was. She said that she had said Y wasn't in pain because she hadn't noticed that he was.

 
Mr Swiffen asked M why she had taken photographs of the injury. She said "It wasn't there on the Monday. I didn't want to be accused of doing this. She had not explained to F why she was taking the photographs. He asked why M had not returned the calls to the nurses at the medical team or taken Y to the GP which was "round the corner". M said that she had asked the nurses to come out and didn't know why she hadn't gone to the GP. She was asked why she had refused to take Y to the GP when the nurse had suggested it and she said: "I didn't. I asked for someone to come to the home. It does take me a while to take their advice."

 
M told me that it's not possible that F had caused the injury. She questioned in her evidence whether since it was a hot day the leather seats had caused the burn but was satisfied that the seat was not too hot.  She said that her relationship with F was good, although like any couple they have arguments. She gave an example of F being 10 minutes late for Z's birth but confirmed that she is not concerned about his fidelity.

 
Mr Swiffen asked M about a conversation she had had late at night in hospital with a nurse on the ward on 3 August 2013 when she had spoken about F "playing away". M's reaction was that a woman she knew in Humberside had said that F had had sex with her and she had had a baby. She said "She's a liar". Mr Swiffen explored this with M and she said that the woman used to babysit for her. F had told her that he didn't have sex with the woman and she said "She's had sex with most people in Humberside". They had received a letter alleging that F was the father of the child after she had moved to Bradford and she had read the letter to him. A DNA test had been arranged but had not been done and she had not asked F why it had not been undertaken. Miss Kemp suggested that there was a long history between F and the woman in Humberside which had caused tension. M agreed that she had seen a copy of a Daytime television show where both the woman and F had featured in respect to difficulties in their relationship. 

 
F explained that he had been on a Daytime television show with the woman from Humberside before she became pregnant. He said that he had not had a DNA test because his GP doesn't do them and that he had told the social workers involved with that child that he would look after that child if nobody wanted it. In cross examination F said that he had declined to take the test. 

 
F told me that he had been married and had had a child who he had had to leave. He had also cared for a refugee child. Mr Swiffen asked F how old the Humberside baby is. F said he thought the baby was 1 or 2 years old, and that it was older than Z. He accepted that he had had a sexual relationship with the woman, but not at the relevant time and said that the matter had not caused any difficulties with M.

 
M said that she does not swear at the children and she denied calling them little shits. She said that nurse Lyles was mistaken when she described M as aggressive and she may have misinterpreted the fact that she had said "He's had a shit". F's evidence was that in fact it was he who had smelt the nappy and said "He's had a little shit". 

 
M also denied that she had sworn at the children in front of Nurse Yacoub and denied saying "It's the only language they understand". F also said that M does not swear at the children.  She also denied that X often looked after Y when he was having a seizure as observed by Ms Barratt. She said "I've told her not to. She does it once in a blue moon".

 
 Mr Swiffen asked M about Y's pain reaction, and suggested that she must have realised that Y was in pain. She said "he jumps at the slightest little touch". He pointed out that M had told the nurses that she had not given Y any pain relief. She said that if she had been advised to give it to him she would have done. She could not recall Y being in visible pain as Nurse Lewis removed the dressing and she denied that she had been reluctant to take Y to the hospital. Mr Swiffen suggested that the only reason Y was taken was because F had said he should go. M denied this.

 
Mr Swiffen asked M about the apnoea mat, and asked her why she had said that at times it had been too hot to pick up when in fact it has no heating element. She said that it had got hot on occasions and that she had 3 mats and only one had been tested.

 
M said that despite the evidence she did not "fully" accept that the injury was a burn caused by contact with a hot object. She said "I don't see how it could have happened. I still say it's a reaction to the Hyoscine patch" She said "Nobody has burnt him and nobody would have put a hot object on his bottom. I haven't hurt him I love my children."

 
F said that he had not hurt Y and he didn't think M had. He said he was unable to say whether the cause of the lesion was an accident or not.

 
F said that his first language is Kurdish and that he is unable to read or write in English. He gave evidence through an interpreter. He agreed that he speaks to SH, M and the children in English and that he had not had an interpreter when he had appeared on the Daytime television show. He said that his English causes him difficulties when he has appointments which involve more formal language. He did not require an interpreter when he visited the GP but had struggled when he took his driving licence exam, taking 32 attempts to pass it. He explained that he had been ill when Y was in hospital and he had concentrated on Y when he was at the hospital, rather than on the conversations with nurses and doctors. He agreed that he had attended private law court proceedings in Bradford in respect of X and participated without an interpreter. He said he didn't need one because "The solicitor explained everything". 

 
Mr Swiffen asked F why he had asked to be attached to a heart monitor at the hospital. F replied that he has a cardiac monitor of his own but he had forgotten it and simply wanted to check his blood pressure. Mr Swiffen asked him why he had changed his story. He said that the information from Social Workers was a pack of lies and said that Jim Clayton was racist because he had refused to place the children with an Asian friend.

 
F denied that there had been any stresses and strains in the home when M had moved in and he had taken on the burden of the daytime child care. He said he had not been frustrated by it but had wanted to look after the children. He explained that his father had been killed when he was 9 years old and he had cared for his family. The fact that it was Ramadan had not made a difference to him either, in fact he felt that it was better to keep busy. He denied that he was ever aggressive and said that M had taught him how to deal with Y's seizures and he had done it how she had shown him.  

 
F accepted that he had been in a very emotional state when Y was in hospital. When told M had said he appeared to be scared he said "Why should I be scared? I had compassion for the kids. I told my mum what was going on. She lives abroad". He said that he was acting strangely because he was worried. He had asked M what had happened when he was out on the evening of the 15th and whether anyone else had been to the house, but denied discussing with her what to say about what had happened. He had asked her about why people were saying it was a burn to Y's bottom and she had talked about reactions to drugs and the patch. He said "I'm not sure who to believe" but was clear that if it was a burn it would be M who was responsible as he had not burnt Y. F produced a bundle of internet printouts from his jacket which were about reactions to drugs and Hyoscine patches. They were in English and he said that M had given them to him a couple of weeks before the hearing. He said that when he sees the documents he believes M but that he believes the doctors as well. Mr Swiffen pointed out to him that they were dated 8 December 2013 which was the previous Saturday night, in the course of the proceedings. F said that he didn't know when they had been printed. 

 
F said that he had installed CCTV in the home when Y was in hospital so that he could show nothing would happen to the children.

 
MG said that he had known F about 10 years. He said that since he works and F doesn't he sees F once or twice a week and that on most Saturdays they go to a particular restaurant for a meal. He was aware that X is not living with the family but said that F had not given him the reasons other than to say that one of the children had been unwell and social services had taken the children. 

 
He said the issue of him giving evidence had only come about recently but he was very well able to recall what had happened because it was the fifth day of Ramadan and he hadn't fasted that day. He had not discussed the day at all with F but had recently been contacted by a lawyer to ask him to attend court. He recalled F going to the restaurant on 15 July and offering him a lift home. The restaurant had closed at 10pm and they had chatted for an hour. He checked his watch when F dropped him home and it was 11.15pm. He particularly remembered the time because he had an appointment the next day. He also told me that a man called "Uncle Ibrahim" had also been given a lift home. 

 
Julie Ross, the Children's Guardian, said that she supported the Local Authority plans in the event that I find that the injury is a non accidental injury. She said that the injury is serious and in her view is equivalent to a child with broken bones. In her assessment the risk of harm would be too great to return the children to M and F. She said that if one of the parents is exonerated then that person should be assessed further, although she was concerned that neither M nor F seemed to be open to the possibility that this could be non accidental injury. 

 
In her assessment it is not possible to manage risk when there would appear to be deliberate infliction of injury. She felt that the evident stresses and strains, including money problems, infidelity and child care responsibilities taken together with the events of the day were insufficient to be regarded as triggers to such serious actions.

 
Ms Ross said that she had hoped an accidental cause for Y's lesion would be found. M and F have cooperated with her and they appear to have a loving relationship with the children, however on the balance of the evidence she was concerned that this was a serious injury in circumstances where the M and F had told differing accounts and therefore the ideal of reunification was not possible. She could not envisage any support package which could be put in place to enable the M and F to care for the children.

 
Ms Ross said that she agreed with the care plan for Y.  In her opinion there needs to be a care order to share PR with M and to place him in foster care, hopefully with his current carers who are nurses rather than in residential care. She did not feel that adoption was a realistic option for Y, especially since it is important to maintain sibling contact, it would mean another change for Y and it would be unlikely that an adoptive home would be found for a child with such profound life limiting difficulties. There is of course a risk of change of placement with foster care however Ms Ross opined that retention of family is important for Y. She was concerned that the LA must involve M with major medical issues and end of life decision making, and said that it would be important for M to attend appointments with Consultants but not routine appointments.

 
Ms Ross also supports the care plan for X and Z. Although Z is not related to AH he has been with X since his birth and they have a good attachment. Adoption would mean separation from his half sibling and would end contact with his family. Although he is young Ms Ross assessed that the benefits of a family placement outweigh placement for adoption. X will be placed in a home she knows with a half sister and she has a good attachment to AH. Ms Ross was confident that AH would promote parental contact and sibling contact. She said that in her view a care order is not necessary because a special guardianship order would support the placement and would mean that the children would not have a statutory parent, but she supported the making of a supervision order to assist with contact issues.  Ms Ross had never used an interpreter when speaking with F: "His English is heavily accented but is very good".

 
Ms Ross expressed surprise that X and Z remained at home without proceedings even though Dr Jepp had said from the outset that this was a contact burn. She felt that it would have been more prudent to seek removal of the children whilst enquiries were made. On receipt of the second opinion the LA had followed that course but it was some weeks after the injury.

 
Ms Ross said that the infliction of a burn in these circumstances would point to deliberate infliction rather than loss of control. She said that even though the parents otherwise seem to be loving and caring Y is defenceless and can't cry. In her opinion to burn him and then not give him pain relief, if that's happened, was cruel. Although this was a "one off" it was sufficiently significant to mean that all three children were at risk of serious physical harm even with parents who appeared to be affable and caring.

 
 Mr Taylor suggested to Ms Ross that her view had been obscured because she was so shocked by the injury and that she had not fully considered how the case could be managed.  Ms Ross said she had looked for an accidental cause and had wanted all options to be explored, including the apnoea mat, the Hyoscine patch and the question of a skin condition. She agreed that it is preferable for any child to be with his parent if it's safe but said "In this case, it isn't." More inconsistencies had been uncovered during the course of the hearing which was of concern for her.

 
Submissions
All advocates produced very detailed and helpful written submissions which I have read very carefully. The submissions were approved by their clients and I shall not set them out here but I do commend each for the effort put in. The advocates also agreed a short summary of applicable law. This again was very helpful and enabled them to concentrate on the factual matters so important to their clients. I am grateful to them all. They also had the opportunity to expand orally.

 
Mr Swiffen submitted that neither M nor F have provided any explanation for the burn and neither has indicated that anybody else could have been responsible for causing it. He said "�absent of any explanation, on the balance of probability this burn was non accidental, caused by a hot object being placed on Y's buttock, that it was inflicted by M or F". He also submitted that whoever was not the perpetrator of the burn failed to protect Y from sustaining this injury and that there has been collusion between the parents to try to cover up what has happened to Y, they both knowing the real cause of the injury. The LA do not suggest that I can identify the actual perpetrator of the injury, Mr Swiffen submitting: "The local authority has carefully considered whether it is possible to determine whether there is sufficiently cogent evidence to determine which of the 2 parents is the perpetrator. Its conclusion is that neither parent has given a truthful account of what has happened to Y. Both have attempted to cover up what has happened. It is impossible to identify the perpetrator on the evidence, but the court can conclude it was one of the two of them."

 
Mr Taylor urged me not to come to a finding against such caring parents. He said that grossly cruel behaviour is very unlikely from such an obviously caring mother. M has always been very loving towards Y and has ensured that he received the best attention. She had done "a wonderful job" and all were agreed that she loves her children very much. M has worked with the Guardian and the social worker and has cooperated fully with the proceedings. Mr Taylor made it clear that whilst matters had been raised about F's conduct, M did not wish to put forward a positive case against him. On the question of pain relief Mr Taylor submitted that M and F had administered Calpol to Y and had applied Sudocrem to the lesion, which was entirely appropriate.

 
Mr Brown echoed Mr Taylor's submissions that this was not a case where the parents blamed each other. F did not put forward a positive case against M, but stressed the positives about himself to demonstrate that it is unlikely to be he who inflicted the injury. 

 
Mr Brown urged me to ignore the references to F's behaviour in leaving his first wife and child and towards the refugee child he cared for when travelling to the UK, as irrelevant to Y.  He said that recent evidence shows that F was caring very well for these three children and has acted always in their interests.

 
My assessment of the professional evidence.
I found the evidence of Drs Essex, Falder and Jepps to be helpful. Each gave evidence in a balanced and professional manner and all had carefully assessed all the available evidence. None displayed "expert arrogance" and they were willing to discuss all the possibilities, however far fetched they may have seemed. Dr Essex impressed me with his willingness to concede that he should have included more on the differential diagnoses in his initial report and have been less dismissive of the suggestions made about impetigo and other dermatological conditions in his written responses to questions raised on behalf of the children. All maintained their professional opinions that the lesion to Y's buttock was most likely caused by a thermal contact burn and gave well reasoned explanations for the opinions they gave.

 
My overall concern about the evidence of Mr Clayton was that he had been over simplistic in his assessment of risk and in respect of causation. Mr Clayton clearly wanted there to be an accidental cause for the lesion and he was not as robust in challenging the parents during the assessment as he might have been. He seems to have accepted the assertion that the parents were very good carers without delving any deeper. He did not really investigate the strains in their household, including the alleged infidelity of F as evidenced by the enquires made by Humberside, nor did he analyse the impact of the enormous changes in location, routine and roles which had been implemented during the few weeks before the admission. His evidence was flawed in this regard.

 
I found the evidence of Mr Perkins and Mr Sheikh to be measured and balanced. They had not colluded and gave insightful and independent views about the version of events given by F shortly after admission.

 
Ms Ross gave clear, well considered and analytical evidence. My only criticism of Ms Ross evidence was that she had not given serious consideration to loss of control and had concentrated on an aspect of premeditated infliction of harm. It is incumbent on professionals to analyse all options. On balance however her evidence was otherwise very helpful.

 
My assessment of M's evidence
Given that M's care of Y had impressed some of the medical professionals in Humberside, I was surprised by her attitude towards the medical profession when she gave her evidence. I assessed her as someone who has little regard for the views of others if they do not coincide with her own, and it seemed clear that the "tenuous" nature of her relationship with some was due to this. 

 
Whilst perfect parenting is not required of anyone, there were indicators in this case that M does have a short temper with the children. I reject her and F's evidence that she does not swear at them. The evidence of Nurse Lyles there being lots of swearing in the home and the children being referred to as "little shits" is consistent with the evidence of Nurse Yaqoob that M was swearing at the children and said "this was the only language that the child responds to". The explanation that the parents were simply stating that Y had had a "little shit" was frankly unbelievable. Similarly, I accept that on occasions M let X do some of the caring for Y, as observed by professionals. 

 
M's evidence about what happened on 15 and 16 July was inconsistent and lacked credibility. She was unable to account for all her movements from leaving Dr Woods surgery late morning,  travelling to Leeds, which is usually a 15 - 20 minute journey,  to see F's friend to then returning after a 10- 45 minute visit  to Leeds at about 4 pm.  She gave varying accounts of what happened when they arrived home. In her oral evidence and in the core assessment she said she went to bed at 8.30 pm. In her Children Act statement she said she went to bed at midnight. In her oral evidence she said that at 8 pm she gave Y his milk and medicine and changed his nappy, then took him straight to bed, checking him at 10 pm and midnight. This was the first time she had mentioned checking him at 10 pm. In the core assessment M stated that F came up to bed at 1 am and he then got up when he heard Y grunt. In her Children Act statement she said he had come to bed at 2 am. Finally, in the core assessment M said F first showed her the mark at 9.30/ 10 am the following morning but in her Children Act statement she states he told her when he came back to bed in the night that there was a red mark and rash on Y's buttock and body and that he had applied Sudocream to it.

 
Many people are inconsistent when they give accounts of what has happened in stressful situations. In this case however I find that M's evidence goes beyond normal forgetfulness. At times during cross examination M was positively evasive. I have borne in mind that people lie for many reasons and that because they lie about one thing does not mean that they lie about another. In my assessment however M has deliberately tried to hide what happened to Y. I do not know her motivation for doing so. It was particularly telling that M could not explain why she did not follow her normal routine of checking Y every hour or couple of hours during the night. On one version of events she was in bed from 8pm until 9.30am without regularly checking on him

 
M told me that she photographed the lesion when she saw it in the morning, but has been unable to explain why. She suggested to the nurses that the lesion was akin to an allergic reaction when it was absolutely obvious to anyone who saw it that it was nowhere near the place where the Hyoscine patch had been and it was clearly blistered and very sore. She even said in one telephone call that the patch had pulled the skin off which was plainly untrue. Mr Swiffen submitted that careful analysis of the nurses' evidence indicates that M was "far from proactive in obtaining medical attention". I find that M  failed to return numerous calls from Miss Lyles on the 16th and that she did not call the hospital 4 or 5 times that day because  there is no record of any calls from her being received. 

 
Parents are often put in a difficult position when allegations of non accidental injury are made and they are asked to explain the cause. I realise that a parent in that situation may put forward all sorts of explanations which are later discredited. I am always willing to give such parents the benefit of the doubt and am very slow to criticise them for their actions. In this case however M has gone significantly further: In respect of the apnoea pad in her statement of the 11th July she said "the mat can become very warm and on some occasions if left on, it has been too hot to pick up." The engineer's report indicates the pad cannot generate heat. M's evidence that there were other pads which she used which may mean the wrong pad was tested was deliberate deceit. M has always referred to the pad. The pad was given to the police. The pad was tested. I find that she was engaged in an active act of deception designed to cover up what happened to Y, and that the reason for that deception is because she is hiding the truth, whatever that might be. This goes much further than slight exculpatory deception. I find her evidence to be a complete tangled web of deceit. 

 
My assessment of F's evidence.
Many parents give evidence through an interpreter. I am used to hearing evidence given in that way and do not draw inferences from it. Even where a person can speak some English the stress of a court situation can mean that they use an interpreter to ensure that their evidence is what they want to say. In this case F has used an interpreter, and I make no criticism of him for doing so. The reason his ability to understand and speak English is relevant is because he has raised it as an explanation for the fact that until the care proceedings started he told people that he was at home on the night of the 15th and since then he has said that in fact he went out. He states that those who recorded or recall the former position misunderstood him and should not be believed because he did not have an interpreter.

 
F has had three relationships with English women. He has spoken with them and his children in English, and in his statement F describes his conversational English as being good.  In the private law proceedings relating to X he engaged with professionals, including Mr Perkins, and with the court without an interpreter and in these proceedings he has been asked whether he wanted an interpreter (by Mr Perkins) but has not requested any interpretation until the hearings. Both Jim Clayton and Julie Ross have said that they have had no need to use an interpreter when conversing with him, and F appeared on the Daytime television show without an interpreter.

 
I was satisfied on the evidence of Dr Jepps and the social workers who took a history from F shortly after Y was admitted, that the information that F was at home on the 15th July 2013 came from him. He was able to give them considerable detail. The detail had to come from him, it was not something they could have made up or got from elsewhere. Dr Jepp in particular is meticulous about her note taking and attributing what is written to the person who said it.  I find that at the time F understood what was being asked and what he said in response. 

 
That of course leaves me with the issue of whether F was at home that night or not. He has told two very detailed and very different versions. At least one must be a lie. 

 
In the core assessment F said that on the 15th July they had not visited anybody, but this was changed in his Children Act statement to include a trip to see a friend in Leeds. In that statement F said that they had returned home in the early afternoon, which changed in oral evidence to around 4pm.

 
On 18 July he told Dr Newbiggin that Y was "washed and dressed Monday night by dad". On the same day Dr Jepps noted F  " �confirmed he had changed Y's nappy at 8 pm on Monday and 2 am early Tuesday morning." The next day he told Mr Sheikh that he had "�changed [Y] at 8 pm and noticed red to buttock at that time but not as much as it is now. Coughing up phlegm at 2 am next, when changed nappy saw a big massive red mark...". He maintained this position to Ms Perkins on 8 August, saying that he put Y to bed at 8-9 pm, taking him out of his pea pod and noticing a sore on his buttock. 

 
The alternative version is that he went out at about 5pm and was with friends until the early hours of the next morning. This is born out by MG, who I have to say I found to be a very unsatisfactory witness. He had an apparently detailed recollection of 15 July 2013, despite not being asked to recall what had happened for months. His version of the night's events was almost word perfect with F's, yet he was vague on other details. F could give minute detail about the evening whereas he was very sketchy as to what had happened during the day.

 
Mr Swiffen submitted "The court is left with 2 diametrically opposed accounts. One is a deliberately false account but it is very difficult to know which.  Did he see the injury at 8 pm or at 2 am ? Why lie about when he first saw it ?  It is very difficult to know why he has committed such a lie on such a grand scale. Either it is a part of an attempt by him to distance himself as a possible perpetrator of the injury or it is part of a collusion with the mother to try to cover up what has happened. Either way this lie should profoundly affect the court's overall view of his credibility." This submission encapsulates the problem of F's evidence about the events of 15 and 16 July. 

 
Sadly, this rather stark illustration of F's lack of credibility was not isolated. It permeated his whole evidence. Even the simple question of whether he had any other children was met with obfuscation and attempted deception. His feigning belief that the question was about children in England was unbelievable, as was his lack of candour in relation to his relationship with the woman in Humberside and his failure to obtain DNA evidence. His attempt to bolster M's claim that she had not called the children little shits by suggesting he had said Y "has had a little shit" was further evidence of his willingness to lie.

 
Collusion.
I am left in no doubt that both parents have lied and lied extensively. It seems clear to me that they have colluded with one another to hide the truth from me. The collusion runs throughout their evidence, with clear examples such as F's attempt to deflect criticism of M for denigrating the children and M supporting F's story change on the basis that he had been misunderstood. I am satisfied on the evidence that M and F are covering up. I do not know who is covering for whom. I do not know why they have both lied so extensively whilst claiming to love all three children and to put their needs above all else. 

 

Findings on disputed issues
I wish to make it plain that I have not looked at the issues in separate compartments or in a linear fashion but have considered them as part of the overall evidence in the case. I separate them out here only for clarity and to demonstrate my reasoning and analysis. Throughout I have borne in mind that these parents have been observed to be normal loving and caring parents by several professionals.

 
Was the lesion caused by an allergic reaction to a Hyoscine patch? 
The alternatives put forward by the parents have been carefully considered by the experts. The explanations include an allergic reaction to medication, in particular the hyoscine patch. This explanation is categorically refuted by the experts because the patch was in a different location to the site, at most it could cause reddening to the skin, and it could not cause a burn injury. I accept the expert evidence on this issue and find that the patch did not cause the injury to Y's bottom, nor was it caused by a reaction to any other medication, deep heat cream or sudocrem..

 
Was the lesion caused by a thermal burn incurred by placing Y on an overheating apnoea pad?
I agreed to the testing of the pad by an expert because M had described the pad as becoming too hot to handle on occasions. Irrespective of her continuing to use such a pad for Y in the knowledge that it could overheat, it seemed essential to find out whether the pad could provide a potential accidental explanation. The testing revealed that it could not heat at all. It cannot have caused the injury to Y's bottom and I find as a fact that it did not.

 
Was the lesion caused by scalded skin syndrome? 
In their evidence, Ms Falder and Dr Essex felt it was extremely unlikely that sss was responsible for the injury.  It is an extremely rare condition, but Dr Essex indicated he encountered around 2 cases of it each year and Ms Falder and Dr Jepps had knowledge of the condition. I have borne in mind the fact that Dr Jepps stated in her oral evidence that she had considered scalded skin syndrome as a differential diagnosis when Y arrived on her ward. She said that had she thought was a factor she would have required samples to be taken for testing. Dr Jepps had the benefit of seeing the lesion at the time. She was struck by the straight edges and the corners that were apparent on the edge of the lesion and was clear that the appearance was not characteristic of the syndrome

 
In addition, Y did not present with a raised temperature or feeling unwell, and M confirmed he had not been ill. Dr Jepps was clear that he would have been unwell if he had sss and would have required intravenous antibiotics, which he did not. Dr Jepps also saw photographs of the lesion taken by M earlier in the week, which confirmed her opinion that  Y was not suffering from sss because the lesion had not grown in size in the course of the week. The burns unit at Pinderfields did not test Y for sss.  Again, it is likely in my view that they would have tested for it had they felt it was a potential cause, although I do not place any weight on this as it is an assumption.

 
Dr Essex agreed entirely with Dr Jepps  and he highlighted the same issues which led him to the conclusion that this was not sss.  He said "I consider it very unlikely. Although this condition causes blistering and the skin can peel, it does not cause such straight edges to the lesions and does not look like the lesion shown in the photographs. The child is usually more overall unwell than Y is described as being at the time."

 
Dr Essex has a particular interest in the field of dermatology and based his conclusions both on his considerable clinical experience as well as the information from text books and studies. The written material from the texts provided by the experts confirms " recovery without scarring is usually within 5-7 days with or without antibiotics ..." , whereas Y's injury was still not completely healed in December 2013. Finally, Ms Falder ( whilst deferring to the paediatric opinion ) stated "I think this diagnosis is unlikely, particularly in view of the regular edges of Y's wound." In her evidence she has identified the same issues which had been identified by Jepps and Essex in coming to the conclusion scalded skin syndrome was "very unlikely".

 
I have considered the expert evidence very carefully and I am satisfied on the evidence before me that is very unlikely that the injury to Y was caused by sss because it had been considered as a differential diagnosis by the treating physicians, the lesion has uncharacteristically straight edges, Y was not significantly unwell and the lesion didn't heal in the way a patient with sss recovers. 

 
Do I have sufficient expert evidence to determine this issue or should I adjourn the case to enable the instruction of a Consultant Dermatologist? 
The Children's Guardian did not pursue an application for further evidence on this issue when she had heard the expert evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole. Neither Counsel for M or F made a formal Part 25 application giving details of any expert who they submitted should be instructed. Nonetheless I have considered whether I feel that any further evidence is "necessary" and I have concluded that it is not. Firstly, because diagnosis of sss does not always require the referral of a child to a dermatologist, as it is usually made by the treating paediatrician. Secondly, because there is no "retrospective" test for sss which could be undertaken now. In addition I have the evidence of Dr Jepp which is credible and unchallenged that she considered the diagnosis at the time and finally I have the expertise of Dr Essex who has a particular interest in paediatric dermatology and who has seen over 60 cases of sss. Their expertise is sufficient to guide me in this area, perhaps greater than some dermatologists. None of them suggested that any further testing, for sss or any other cause, or further opinion was necessary and for these reasons I concur with their view. 

 
Was the lesion caused by a thermal burn and if so how?
I have considered evidence from the treating team at Bradford Royal Infirmary, Dr Jepps and Dr Pye, information from the treating team at Pinderfields, including Mr Phipps a plastic surgeon and the independent paediatric overview given by Dr Essex together with the independent report of Ms Falder, who is a burns specialist.

 
All the medical evidence indicates that this was, on balance, a thermal burn. The measured, balanced and careful evidence given by the medical witnesses was cogent and compelling, and I accept it in its entirety. I find that this was a burn from contact with a hot object because there were straight lines and clearly demarcated corners to the injury, which liquid would not cause. The shape of the wound is significant because it had a linear and straight edges to the blister which means it is much more likely to be caused mechanically. This burn was described by Dr Essex as "pretty sizeable" and I accept his evidence that any 5 year old who could communicate would complain. Y of course cannot complain in that way, but I accept Dr Essex's evidence that Y would cry and whenever he was moved the injury would hurt. I find that any carer of Y would know from his facial reactions and his overall demeanour that this burn hurt, particularly when he was moved. 

 
Was this an accidental or non accidental injury?
The simple fact that this was a thermal burn does not prove that it was caused non accidentally. Y's circumstances mean that he could not have moved himself onto a heat source nor put one on himself. There were no heat sources in the car when the parents left Dr Woods surgery, especially since the windows in the back are of darker glass and because M cooled the car down before they set off. There were no heat sources in the room at home where Y was placed in his pea pod when they arrived home and nothing with which X could have picked up and placed on her brother to cause the injury in play. Y wasn't exposed to excessive sun and his nappy was regularly changed so there was no possibility of a lengthy exposure to urine even if that could cause the injury. The apnoea pad didn't cause the burn and the Hyoscine patch, sudocrem and deep heat did not cause it. He was supervised carefully by M or F as part of their daily routine and they report nothing occurring which could provide an accidental cause. They don't have to disprove the case however, and I have borne the burden of proof in mind throughout my deliberations in respect of this case. I am satisfied that there was no accidental cause for the injury to Y.

 
I have borne in mind that M and F are both parents who have been assessed as competent carers by the social worker. I have borne in mind that this is an isolated incident in parenting which has been accepted to be good enough. I am very aware that normally caring parents are less likely to inflict an injury on a child than those who have obvious anger problems or those who are generally neglectful. 

 
The conduct of the parents in these proceedings does however weigh heavily against them. They have lied and colluded and deliberately tried to hide the history of what happened to Y on 15 and 16 July 2013. 

 
There are some clues as to the state of their relationship. They had the pressure of recently moving into one home having lived apart for several years. They had the pressure of new routines, roles and responsibilities. They had the strain of caring for a very disabled child in addition to the demands of a baby and X. They had financial pressures, evidenced by F looking to borrow money from his friend on 15th July to pay for car insurance. They also had the exposed infidelity of F with the woman in Humberside and the investigations which arose from that. 

 
I have concluded that the local authority have proved on the evidence that this injury was caused non accidentally whilst Y was in the care of one or both of his parents and that both parents are in the pool of possible perpetrators of that injury.

 
Having found that the lesion was caused by an inflicted thermal burn can I identify the perpetrator of this non accidental injury?
I have tried to piece together what happened to Y, because it would be in all the children's interests for me to identify a perpetrator. I cannot do so. The evidence points to both and it is impossible for me to separate the strands of fact and fiction to identify which one. The people who could have helped me are M and F. They have decided to stick together and hide the truth.

 
Should M and F have obtained earlier medical treatment for Y and administered pain relief? 
Dr Essex said of the injury "It was self evidently likely to cause pain. A carer would go to the doctor not just because of the way it looked but also because of its size, the pain it would cause and the need for treatment". Anyone looking at the photographs would agree. Dr Falder said that she would not criticise parents for calling the nurse rather than taking to the GP providing they didn't know that this was a thermal burn. In this case I have found that the parents did know that this was a significant thermal burn. I find that rather than take the obvious action of taking Y to A and E or to the GP they delayed treatment by reporting the matter by phone to the nurse, with M clearly suggesting that this mark was caused by an allergic reaction. Whilst F was the parent who eventually insisted that Y was taken to hospital I find that he did so because he realised that there was no alternative at that stage because the nurses were obviously very concerned. I find that M and F would have known that Y was in pain and that he needed pain relief, yet they ignored advice to give it. I reject F's contention that it was M's role to decide about pain relief. He was in the role of a joint main carer. He professes to love Y and be concerned for him. He should have taken action to help Y but he did not. I reject M's assertion to the nurses that Y wasn't in pain. He self evidently was � as they witnessed him grimace. I find that M was aware of his needs but chose to disregard them and to minimise any suggestion that he was suffering. I find that both M and F knew that Y had been significantly injured and that they should have acted to protect him. Both chose not to, and chose instead to try to hide the real cause of his injury and thereby deny his pain.

 
Threshold
In the light of these findings I am satisfied that the threshold is met in respect of each child. In the case of Y because he has suffered significant physical harm at the hands of one or both of his parents, and in respect of X and Z because they are thereby at risk of significant physical harm.

 
Consideration of Welfare checklist

Parliament has provided that when determining where X, Y and Z should live and which order is appropriate I should have particular regard to the Welfare Checklist. I have done so, and have kept their needs paramount throughout my consideration of the case.

 
(a) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding); 
X has a good relationship with F and with M. She also has a good bond with AH and her half sister Kr who lives with AH. She is close to her brothers and cares for them. She clearly would like to be with M and F if possible but equally has said that she would like to live with AH. I imagine she is very confused about her circumstances and what has happened to Y.
Y has a good bond with his M and with F as far as one can tell. He cannot express his wishes but I am sure he would like to remain within his birth family if possible.
Z has a good relationship with his parents and although he cannot yet verbalise his wishes, I am sure that he would wish to be brought up by his parents and to remain with his siblings. Z has always been with his sister X and there is a bond between them. His contact with AH has been positive.
(b)his physical, emotional and educational needs; 
X has an urgent need for her circumstances to be clear and to know where she is going to spend her childhood. She has already had a change of residence from her M to her F therefore needs physical and emotional stability.
Y has very significant additional needs due to his disability. Those needs will change over time but it is particularly important for him to have his health and educational needs met in order for him to reach his full potential.
Z is still a baby. He needs emotional and physical care and stimulation to help him develop.
(c)the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances; 
X I am concerned that any change in circumstances for X needs to be permanent because of the disruption to her life thus far. 
For Y the most important thing is that he is cared for in a family setting by people who understand his profound needs. He should be with M and F if it is safe for him to be there. If he remains in foster care it is very important that his current placement is maintained as it takes time to understand his needs and interpret his feelings. Residential care would not be suitable for Y.
Z has formed good attachments to his parents and his foster carers. He is able to form good bonds with his carers but it is important that any change should be to a permanent home.
(d)his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant; 
X is close to her siblings and it is important that that closeness is promoted as she has had an unsettled past.
It is particularly relevant that Y is a little boy with serious cognitive impairment and developmental delay.
Z is a normal baby who is developing well.
(e)any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering; 
Y suffered a burn to his left buttock described by Ms Falder as a deep thermal wound. When examined by the treating paediatrician on the 8th July it was described as 9 x 11 cm in size at its maximum and consisted of a shape that had a straight edge and side edge at right angles to each other. The burn was sustained at some time following Dr Wood's examination of Y after approximately noon on the 15th July and prior to approximately 10 am on the 16th July. Y would have been extremely distressed at the time this burn was sustained, and those who knew him well would have known he was in considerable distress. Thereafter when the affected area was touched he would have been very uncomfortable and would show it through grimacing. Y has therefore suffered significant physical harm in the form of a contact burn and neglect of his needs whilst in the care of his mother and father. He is at risk of suffering significant physical harm and neglect if returned to their care.
X and Z have not been harmed. The case in relation to them is put that they are at risk of significant harm if returned to their parent's based on the harm suffered by Y. I do not have to be satisfied that such harm is more likely than not to happen. It is enough that there is "a real possibility, a possibility that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case". The feared harm in this case is very serious. Their brother had a serious contact burn inflicted upon him in unexplained circumstances. Without knowledge of whether M or F caused the injury and the triggers which made them act as they have, I am satisfied that there is a real possibility, which cannot be ignored, that they too could suffer significant harm.
(f)how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs; 
M or F or both together have injured Y by causing him to have a significant burn. They have lied about the surroundings so much that it is not possible for me to say what happened and to identify a perpetrator. I am satisfied that if one parent caused the injury the other knew and that they worked together to avoid detection until it became clear that Y had to be admitted to hospital. This meant that although Y was in pain he was not given appropriate relief. Their actions show an inability to meet the needs of their children by protecting them from harm and keeping them safe.
SH has been thoroughly assessed as able to care for X and Z both now and throughout their childhoods.

 (g)the range of powers available to the court under this Act in the proceedings in question.
I have a full range of powers available to me. I could make no order which would mean that the children would return to M and F. I could adjourn the proceedings and direct further assessment of M and F either with or without the children or any combination of the children in their care. I can make orders under s 8 including residence orders, which I could make in favour of M or F. If threshold is proved I can make care or supervision orders in relation to each or all of the children. I can make a Special Guardianship Order in favour of AH in relation to X and Z.  
Analysis of Placement Options
Placement of the children with M and F
Placement of some or all of the children with their parents should be the starting point wherever possible. It's what I am sure they would want and is what their parents want. The placement can only be in their interests however if it is a safe placement. In this case it would not be safe, and the risks to each of them, of significant physical harm cannot be managed under a care order. I don't know what triggered the injury to Y. I don't know who was responsible for it. I do know that the parents knew that something serious had happened to him and they have tried very hard to protect themselves and each other with lies and collusion. Neither has put the children first and admitted what happened. I cannot trust either parent to protect against the other and I cannot expect the Local authority to provide 24 hour monitoring in the home. Placement with M and F is not a safe option for these children.

 
Placement of X and Z with AH supported by a supervision order
The advantages to X and Z are that they would be in a family placement which would not be subject to the fetters of corporate parenting. Their carer will receive a support package which will enable her to care for them during their minority and I have no doubt that her attachment to them will continue far into their adulthood. The SGO gives AH the ability to exercise parental responsibility in a way similar to the Local Authority under a care order and these types of orders are much more secure than a residence order because they are more difficult to challenge in the future. The supervision orders give AH the additional support needed in respect of contact. The assessment of AH is thorough and can be relied upon.

 
Placement of X and M in foster care
The advantages of foster care for X and Z are that they would remain members of their birth family, and I am sure that X has a strong sense of identity about her family and attachment to Y and Z, while they would still be provided with appropriate nurturing care. All siblings could have contact. The real disadvantages for them would be that they would be looked after by corporate carers who could change careers and who would in any event hand over care to the community via the leaving care team at 18 or 21. The risks of breakdown of long term foster placements are well known and would make the placement particularly unsuitable for Z. Both children would also have the inevitable restrictions placed upon them which corporate parenting brings.

 
Placement of X and Z for adoption
For X and Z this would give them the option of becoming members of a new family, which would of course give them security. There may be difficulties in them seeing Y, who is very important to them and they would lose contact with Kr, M, F and SH. Further, they would cease to be, in law and fact, members of their birth family, and they clearly have attachments to those family members I have mentioned. For Z the chances of a successful adoptive placement would be good bearing in mind his age, but since adoption is a last resort and there is a wider family placement available, adoption would not on balance be in his best interests.

 
Placement of Y in foster care
Y's needs are very significant. His current placement is highly specialist and is very suitable. The disadvantages for him are that corporate parenting is risk averse and he may not have the opportunities to be exposed to riskier but life enhancing options which M may have taken for him and of placement breakdown in the event that his carers choose to stop fostering.

 
Placement of Y for adoption
The reality for Y is that he would be very difficult to place for adoption. He would lose the contact with his siblings which is very important to him and to M and F. M's contribution to his end of life planning would be lost and another move would mean he would have the trauma once again of placement with strangers.

 
Comparison of options
Having weighed each option and considered the internal positives and negatives I have compared them side by side. 

 
What X needs is a stable placement which will maintain her family identity but will also provide her with protection from harm. 

 
What Y needs is a family home which will safely provide good enough care in order to meet his needs. His mother cannot do so. Of the other options, placement in long term foster care is clearly better for him than adoption because links to his family can be maintained by direct contact.

 
What Z needs is a placement within his wider family which enables him to live with X, to whom he is attached and maintain safe contact with his parents.

 

Adjournment for further assessment
I have carefully considered whether it would be appropriate to adjourn for a further assessment of M and F. I can see no benefit in the delay that this would cause. In the light of my findings even if one of the parents now confessed to the infliction of harm and claimed that the other was entirely without knowledge or blame they simply could not be believed in the light of the obvious collusion which I have found. Similarly, in the light of that same sustained and clear collusion the non perpetrator could not be assessed in the timescales for these children, who need a decision to be made for them without further delay. 

 
Decision
 I have therefore concluded, taking into account all of the evidence both oral and written and applying the relevant law whilst keeping the children's  welfare as my paramount consideration, that their needs can only be met by placement as follows. X and Z shall be placed with AH under a Special Guardianship Order. I make supervision orders in respect of them for 12 months to enable support for contact to be put in place.  Y will remain in foster care as it is not safe for him to be returned to M and F. I ask that the IRO monitors this special little boy's placement very carefully to ensure that he is not moved around but is maintained in his current foster placement if at all possible.

 

Order

1. There shall be a Special Guardianship Order in favour of  AH in respect of X and Z
2. There shall be supervision orders in respect of X and Z in favour of Bradford City Council for 12 Months.
3. There shall be a Care order in respect of Y in favour of Bradford City Council.
4. There shall be no order for costs save Public Funding assessment of the Respondents' costs.

Introduction
	In these proceedings I am concerned for X, a child who is eight months old. He is the child of M and F and they both have parental responsibility for him.  X's paternal grandmother was a party to these proceedings as she had hoped to be able to offer X a long term home but she withdrew on 4 February, accepting she needed to focus on another grandchild in her care.  M has had two children prior to X.  The first was removed and placed with his maternal grandmother due to neglect and the grandmother obtained a special guardianship order in November 2011.  Her second child was subject to care proceedings just prior to X's birth, and on 22 March 2013 final care and placement orders were made in respect of her. 

 
	The local authority's concerns regarding the parents' ability to care for X stemmed from the issues which led to his half sister being removed from his mother's care after a failed residential assessment of her and X's father.  X was accommodated at birth by the local authority, a police protection order having been made on the day of his birth as his parents would not agree to him being accommodated. An emergency protection order was then made on 23 July, followed by an interim care order on 26 July. Interim care orders have been renewed regularly since that time and he has remained living in foster care.  The parents have had regular separate contact sessions three times a week since X went into care and have been very committed to attending those, ensuring they are always early to arrive.  They have also both attended his health appointments along with his foster carer. 

 
	X's case began life in the family proceedings court but was transferred in November 2013 to be heard by me due to the fact that I was hearing the proceedings regarding the paternal grandmother's other grandchild.  She was at that point seeking to care for both grandchildren and an overview needed to be taken of her ability to do that.  That meant some delay but it was important for X for the court to be sure whether there was any possible placement for him in his birth family, given the negative assessments of his parents over these proceedings and the proceedings regarding his half-sister.  In the event, an independent social work assessment of her concluded she could care for one but not both and as she was caring for the other grandchild already she reluctantly accepted she would not be able to care for X and she withdrew from these proceedings.  

 
	Prior to my involvement the father had sought assessment of himself as a sole carer but that application had been refused by the magistrates on 19 August.  It was felt much was known about the father from the assessments in respect of the proceedings regarding the mother's second child and the court felt it had sufficient information to decide X's long term future.  Upon the grandmother withdrawing from these proceedings the father made a further application for an independent social work assessment of himself as a sole carer, saying if necessary he would separate from the mother although he had resumed his relationship with her.  I refused that application on 27 February, on the basis it was not necessary; I was satisfied I had sufficient information available to me to decide the case and his issues with the case put by the local authority and guardian could be tested out in cross-examination at this hearing. 

 
Background
	The summary of the background to this case I take from the local authority's written opening, it entirely reflecting my reading of the papers prior to hearing the case.  The mother was first known to Children's Services in 2003 due to issues of conflict with her mother. The mother moved out of the grandmother's home at the age of sixteen, at which time there were reported concerns about her use of drugs and alcohol. During her first pregnancy the community midwife made a referral to the local authority, expressing concerns about her ability to meet the needs of a child due to her own vulnerability. A core assessment carried out at that time concluded the mother needed a great deal of support to parent her son.  After his birth she lived with her mother for two months before moving into her own property. Just a week later a professionals meeting was held where concerns were raised that the child's needs were being seriously neglected. That child was placed with the maternal grandmother whilst a further core assessment was completed. The grandmother subsequently applied for and was granted a special guardianship order in respect of that child in November 2011.  

 
	After the birth of her second child, she and her partner, the father in this case (who was not that child's father) undertook a residential assessment as part of these proceedings. There were many concerns about the care given to that child at the residential unit and about the volatile and unstable nature of the couple's relationship.  The father left the unit prior to the end of the assessment and due to concerns expressed by staff for the welfare of the child the local authority sought and obtained permission from the court to end the assessment early.  A care order and a placement order were later made.   

 
	During those proceedings, concerns arose that the mother was pregnant with her third child.  She denied this was the case but later admitted she had lied about this. A pre-birth assessment was undertaken in respect of the expected child and concluded that the baby would be at risk of significant harm in the care of either parent and recommended that care proceedings should be commenced at birth with the baby being placed in foster care.  That then led to these proceedings beginning. 

 
	The findings made in the proceedings regarding the middle child (anonymised by me) were as follows : 

 
a.	The mother is the mother of one previous child who was the subject of child protection concerns immediately following his birth. He was accommodated by the local authority with the consent of his mother at the age of five months and now resides in the care of his maternal grandmother under a special guardianship order. 
b.	The mother is a young and vulnerable person who has led a chaotic lifestyle involving the use of recreational drugs and excessive alcohol. 
c.	The mother has a very limited experience of supporting herself independently in her own accommodation. She has struggled in the past to cope with the day to day care of herself and running a home without significant professional support, raising concerns as to how she will manage to cope in the community with the care of a young and vulnerable child.
d.	The mother suffers from a degree of learning difficulty and presents as emotionally considerably younger than her years. She is easily manipulated as a result of her increased vulnerability, raising concerns as to her ability to identify risk. 
e.	The mother has in the past failed to protect herself from the risk posed to her by her own father against whom she has made allegations of sexual abuse and has not always been able to accept the local authority's concerns about her historical relationship with him. This raises further concern about her ability to recognise the potential risks to her daughter.
f.	The mother failed to prioritise the health of her daughter pre-birth through her failure to consistently attend all ante-appointments and by failing to register with a general practitioner.
	In terms of threshold in these proceedings, the mother accepts that those findings were made against her in the earlier proceedings which concluded in care and placement orders. The mother accepts because of those findings and the lack of change in her situation she cannot seek to care for X. The parents accepted that the relationship between them has been an unstable one, characterised by heated arguments over trivial matters and marred by separations and reconciliations. The parents conceded as a result of the previous findings and the situation regarding their own relationship X would be at risk of suffering significant harm in their care.  That means that they accept that the first hurdle I have to overcome in considering whether to make a care order is met and I approve the amended threshold document as agreed between the parties.  

 
The issues and the evidence
	In preparing for this hearing I have read the full bundle of papers provided to me in this matter.  The case was due to be heard fully today and tomorrow as the father was not accepting the plan for X.  However this morning the father, having considered carefully all the evidence in the case, was able to make the very brave decision that he would not oppose the making of the orders.  He and the mother very much wanted X to be brought up by the father but they realised the weight of the evidence against that.  Ms Brocklebank on behalf of the father said although he did feel he had matured he wanted to put his son's interests first and that meant him making the very difficult decision that X would be better off being adopted. I have to say that is a very impressive decision, one parents are understandably very rarely able to make.  I can only guess at how hard this is for these parents who have showed such commitment to their child over eight months and who hoped he would grow up in his father's care.  To be able to face up to the case against them and then to accept the situation takes great courage.  Putting one's child first is a sign of a caring parent and clearly this father and mother have done just that. I have to give a proper judgment in this case, to explain the decision I have taken, but it is important to record early the approach the parents have taken. 

 
	The local authority's application today, supported by the guardian, is for care and placement orders in respect of X, enabling him to be placed for adoption. The social worker's position since last summer has been that neither parent is in a position to care for X and, now that it is known there is no family option, the best outcome for X would be for him to be adopted. The local authority's concerns about the mother's ability to parent are not in dispute. In respect of the father, the local authority relies on the information gathered in the proceedings regarding X's older half sister and the pre-birth assessment and updated assessment in these proceedings, together with the fact that the parents remain in a relationship, despite a separation for some of these proceedings. I am not going to set out those assessments in detail but in essence what I gain from them is that the difficulties in the parents' relationship when in the residential unit, together with the other concerns about the mother's difficulties with her older children, prevented them giving good care to the mother's middle child and those issues still remain.  The parents have been unable to remain separated and therefore the local authority says in reality the mother would still be part of X's life were he to be in his father's care, with all the risks that would bring. 

 
	The local authority has looked at the options for X, including placement with his father, a family placement, long-term foster care and placement for adoption and concludes the latter would best meet X's needs. The guardian supports that assessment and agrees with the plan for X. He too is of the view that neither parent can offer safe and sustainable parenting for X.  He comments upon the resumed relationship between the parents, commenting that this has historically been unstable and of a "stop start" nature, observing that it is probable in such circumstances the mother would share care of X if he was placed with his father. The guardian felt that the father would be isolated and lacking a network of appropriate support were he to be caring given that the assessments of family members and friends were negative.

 
Decision
	I now turn to consider what orders if any are in the best interests of X.  I start very clearly from the position that, wherever possible, children should be brought up by their natural parents and if not by other members of their family.  The state should not interfere in family life so as to separate children from their families unless it has been demonstrated to be both necessary and proportionate and that no other less radical form of order would achieve the essential aim of promoting their welfare.  In Re B [2013] UKSC 33 the Supreme Court emphasised this, reminding us such orders are "very extreme", and should only be made when "necessary" for the protection of the child's interests, "when nothing else will do".  The court "must never lose sight of the fact that (the child's) interests include being brought up by her natural family, ideally her parents, or at least one of them" and adoption "should only be contemplated as a last resort".  I have looked again at the words of the President in Re B-S (Children) [2013] ECA Civ 1146 as well as the judgments in Re B (supra) and reminded myself of the importance of addressing my mind to all the options for this child, taking into account the assistance and support which the authorities or others would offer. 

 
	In reaching my decision I have taken into account that X's welfare is my paramount consideration and also the need for me to make the least interventionist order possible. I am also conscious of the general principle that any delay in determining his future is likely to prejudice his welfare. I have to consider the Article 8 rights of the adults and of X as any decision I make today will inevitably involve an interference with the right to respect to family life. Having given very careful consideration to the orders I am going on to make, I am satisfied that those orders are in accordance with law, necessary for the protection of the children's rights and is proportionate. 

 
	I have considered all the points in the welfare checklists contained in both the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and propose to consider the plans in the light of the most relevant of those factors. 

 
	In terms of X's physical, emotional and educational needs, his particular needs as the Adoption and Children Act 2002 says, the guardian summarises these by saying he needs a stable, safe and loving home environment in order for him to develop and reach his full potential. I would agree with that, as in essence his needs are those of any other small child.  He needs a true sense of who he is and where he comes from and, if he is not to be in the care of his birth family, that can best be given by way of life story work. 

 
	In considering whether he can be placed with his father, there are two particularly relevant factors I need to consider, namely any harm he would be at risk of suffering and how capable his father would be of meeting his needs.  I have considered carefully the assessments of the father, and indeed the mother. I am not going to set out the contents of those assessments here given the approach taken by the parents to this hearing but having considered them I agree that X would be at risk of harm if in the father's care. Given the history of their separations and reconciliations over the time they have been together, I cannot believe it would be any different in the future.  I think the pull of X in his father's care would make it very hard for the mother to keep away. The risks she posed to her older two children would remain and X would be at risk as a result, as well as the risk of emotional harm and neglect of his needs due to the nature of the relationship between the parents. 

 
	I do accept that there are risks to a child through adoption.  There is an inevitable loss of any meaningful relationship with his birth family.  Each time a child moves there is the risk of harm, and X will have a further move once adoptive carers are identified.  I believe that this risk can be ameliorated by the local authority in their choice of the right family for X and careful steps being taken to move him on from the care of his current foster carers.  That task should be aided by the fact that the parents have been able to accept this decision and are keen to engage in life story work to give X the best possible understanding of the family he comes from and his early life experiences.  

 
	I also accept that long term foster care would not be right for a child of X's age.  Black LJ in Re V [2013] EWCA Civ 913 summarised the advantages to children of adoption over long-term foster care in terms of what both types of placement would offer by way of security. With children as young as X I accept the perceived wisdom that he should not be placed in long-term foster care and that his need for a permanent secure home would best be met by an adoptive placement.

 
	In this case, having carried out the balancing exercise that I must, I am satisfied that there is no realistic prospect of X being returned safely to the care of either of his parents, and that his needs for stability and permanence can only be met in an adoptive placement. I am satisfied that the local authority's final care plan for X is proportionate and (in the context of both s1(1) Children Act 1989 and s1(2) Adoption and Children Act 2002) in his best welfare interests. I therefore make a care order in respect of X.  Turning to the question of the parents' consent, I am satisfied that X's welfare requires me to dispense with this, the word "require" here again having the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, "the connotation of the imperative". I therefore also make a placement order authorising the local authority to place X for adoption. 

 
	There is one further direction I wish to make.  I think it is hugely important for children who are adopted that they have information available to them, through their adoptive parents, so they can make sense of their early life.  This judgment, in setting out what I have read, gives at least a summary of that start. Whilst it will be placed in an anonymised form in the public domain, it is important that it is easily available to those who will be bringing X up.  I propose therefore to make a direction that this judgment should be released by the local authority to his adopters so that it is available to him in future life.

JUDGE ROBERTS:

This case is about X, who was born on the 28th April 2004 and who is now nine, and Y, who was born on the 12th July 2005 and who is eight.  This is the final hearing of the private law proceedings between the parents and the child protection plans brought by the London Borough of London Borough of P.  The London Borough of P is involved although this case is in the Chelmsford County Court because at the moment both girls are living within that borough.  The parties are London Borough of P, X's father, Mr G, the mother of those girls, Miss H, R County Council, who have been joined, and the children by their Guardian, Faith Senior of CAFCASS.  The representation has been Mr. Cameron for London Borough of P, Mr. Sawtell for Mr G, Miss Brindle for Miss H, Miss Messenger for R and Mr. Reed for the children.

 

	I have read much of two ring binders of documents which include some documents from the private law and public law proceedings, probably all from the public law proceedings.  The most important documents to mention are a judgment by Murfitt HHJ from September 2011, statements from both of the parents, a s.37 report by the current social worker in London Borough of P, Sarah O'Connor, psychological reports on both parents and answers to questions put to him by Dr. Darren Spooner, a report from Working Close, the unit which has been working with the family in London Borough of P, and reports from the Guardian, and I have heard oral evidence from Miss O'Connor, from Miss Prior, who is the team leader in R, from each parent and from the Guardian.  	

 

	There have been proceedings about these children since 2006 when the parents originally separated, with a gap from 2008 to 2011, when they were reconciled.  I am not going to attempt to summarise the chronology, which is set out in detail at pp.A1 to A26 of the private law proceedings.  It has been unhelpful that there has been little in the way of judicial continuity at least until 2011 when Judge Murfitt took hold of it.  Both girls had always lived with their mother and for much of the time with their father as well, but on the 17th May 2013 the pre-existing joint residence order, as it was termed, was amended so that the girls would spend the weeks with Mr. G for the first time and alternate weekends and half the holidays with Miss H;  in other words, Mr. G was to become the primary carer.  Judge Murfitt was to hear the final hearing in this case last week but was unexpectedly unavailable and the case was adjourned to this week, when she was also not available. The hearing was considered to be urgent so that any move by the child should take place prior to half-term which starts at the end of today.  The hearing has been to resolve Mr. G's application to vary Judge Murfitt's order and he issued that in August last year, and then in December last year London Borough of P issued an application for a care or supervision order for both girls.

 

	Yesterday was my first introduction to this case and reading it over the preceding days, today and yesterday, has been rather shocking even for a judge who has sat for a long time.  The agreed final threshold document summarises the harm which these parents have caused their children but it is a short document and in no way describes in any detail - and I am grateful for that - the failings of the parents and the detrimental effect on the children.  For all these years both parents have put their hostility and conflict with the other parent above the interests of the girls and the girls have suffered emotional harm and distress of a significant nature as a result.  As the Guardian said to me today, we are now a hair's breadth away from the girls needing to be removed from their parents pursuant to a care order.  Mr. G told me yesterday that he had understood this was hanging over the family for the last three years which makes me worried that it has not been seen by him, maybe by both parents, as a real threat.  I must emphasise that I have been considering what is the appropriate public law order most carefully because the parents should not be under any illusion I could disagree with what is being proposed and make care orders.  I will not be doing that but I agree with the experts in this case that this is definitely the very last chance for the parents to make it work having the children at home.

 

	The position of the parties now is this.  The two local authorities, Miss H and the Guardian recommend to me that X moves to live with her mother in R under a shared residence order, and that she be under a supervision order to R for a year.  They all propose that Y remains living with Mr. G pursuant to a shared residence order under a supervision order to London Borough of P for a year.  I will come back to the contact arrangements a bit later.  Mr. G wants X to stay living with him and Y.  He accepts that there should be a supervision order in respect of both girls.  If the two girls live in two different homes it is proposed that after a three month settling in period they see each other each weekend, alternating, spending the weekends together in the home of one parent and then the other parent, but that is subject to it being affordable as both parties are currently on benefits.  For the first three months as the girls adapt to the new arrangements the visits will be on alternate weekends.  The holidays would continue to be shared with both girls staying together but spending half the holidays with one parent and half their holidays with the other parent, but if the girls were living with Mr. G it is proposed that Miss H would continue to see both girls on alternate weekends and half the holidays.  I have to note that for the last eight weeks or so Y has not seen her mother at all, and this is a matter of concern.

 

	The main area of disagreement has been over whether it is right to separate the girls, and I appreciate that Mr. G's case is based most on his belief that it is best for the girls to stay together rather than on his own wishes or any other factor.  The issues I have to decide are therefore should the girls be separated so that one lives predominantly with Miss H and one lives predominantly with Mr. G, do I agree with the proposals for the girls to see each other, do I agree that there should be one year supervision orders, and should there be a s.91(14) order for two years as each parent ask me to direct, and the court Guardian agrees.  As far as the public law aspect of the case is concerned, the relevant law is s.31 if I am considering making final supervision orders today, or indeed care orders, and s.38 if I am considering making interim orders, as I have been thinking about.  As far as the arrangements for where the girls should live, s.1 is the key section and, in particular, the welfare of each of X and Y is my paramount consideration.  

 

	I cannot, in the time left today, attempt to summarise all the evidence about the past and it also would not be helpful.  Perhaps the most important evidence as to the way ahead is the report and the addendum by Dr. Spooner.  I have to say that of the many professional witnesses I have, he writes in a very blunt and clear way, which I find helpful.  He has not been challenged and I accept his evidence which I have found to be most cogently argued.  He eloquently expresses the serious damage which the parental conflict not only causes to hypothetical children but has caused and could cause further to these children. He does go as far as recommending the separation of the girls and I do not agree with submissions made on behalf of Mr. G that he does not go that far;  he does, and he sets out the disadvantages that could ensue as well as the advantages.  He accepts that it carries risks but, on balance, however, he thinks it is necessary.  He finds that Y's primary attachment figure is Mr. G and that Miss H is X's primary attachment figure, and I agree with that.  He then says that he agrees with the local authority proposal to place X with her mother, and he gives various reasons.  He says that:

 

	"If the children are placed separately it would mean that the best therapy for these children at the moment is to enjoy a significantly better and more consistent level of empathetic attunement, attention and response from their parents, and it is for this reason, especially in light of the feelings and wishes of the children, that I think there is mileage in considering the separation of the children.  Notwithstanding L [who is Miss H's baby] this would mean that Y and X would have considerably more access to the primary attachment figure of their choice."

	He says:

	"Neither child wishes to compete with each other for parental attention on a daily basis and both would feel something of a sense of empowerment and therefore feeling that they matter by having their feelings and wishes respected and agreed to.  Such an arrangement would also hopefully serve to demonstrate to both X and Y that their parents had collaborated to prioritise their needs"

	And I very much hope, even though I know this decision is not what Mr. G wants, that he will hear that paragraph.  It will be important for both girls to see that their parents have collaborated to ultimately prioritise their needs.

	On the issue of separation, Dr. Spooner says:

 

	"Primary attachments are more important to children than sibling relationships.  The primary attachments provide protection and safety and meet the majority of the basic and complex needs of children.  Sibling relationships do not. It is clear that attachments to care givers are significantly more important than attachment to similar age pre-adolescent siblings."

	I agree with what has been submitted to me, that there is so much abuse in this family as contained in the reports and I do hope that both parents read them again when the dust has settled.  As Dr. Spooner says, and he says it is characteristic of him repeating himself, but I of course am under the same risk:

	"I am therefore saying that the greatest risk to these children is continued exposure to their parents' problems.  I think this risk overshadows the risks to therefore being separated as long as the parents sort themselves out."

	I turn to the witnesses who attended.  I first heard from Miss O'Connor, a social worker who has given evidence before me in London, and of whom I hold a high opinion.  I found her in this case to be fair, realistic, thoughtful and overwhelmingly sensible.  She was carefully challenged by Mr. Sawtell but I accept her evidence both of X's wishes and feelings but, even more important, about it being in X's best interests, in her professional opinion, to go and live with her mother.  She did not hold back in recognising the good aspects of Mr. G's care for the girls but she was of the view, which I accept, that there is evidence of X feeling that she is on the outside of the relationship between Mr. G and Y, and that stems in part at least from Mr. G and Y's shared negative view of Miss H.  Miss O'Connor told me that Mr. G will not allow her into his house and says he will call the Police if she tries to enter.  That is completely unacceptable behaviour by Mr. G and a prime example of him putting his own wishes and feelings before the interests of the girls.  Although obstacles have been put in her way, I find that this social worker has done excellent work with this family in a very difficult case, and that her proposals for future work to try to improve the parental relationship - mediation, work with Working Close, direct work with the children - is what is needed.

 

	Miss Prior gave brief evidence.  She knows this case from old and she will have management of it if X returns to live in R.  She agrees with the plan for X to return to Miss H and considers that she can work with Miss H as she has done before.  She gave evidence of the improvements in Miss H's ability to care and in herself, and I accept that evidence.

 

	I then heard from Mr. G.  Dr. Spooner had said:

 

	"There is no evidence that I am aware of to suggest that his basic parenting skills and his parenting knowledge are anything other than good enough. The children are reported to have settled well with him since May.  They have settled well back into their old schools and they are ostensibly doing well."

	He also says that Mr. G can talk the talk about the importance of Miss H and him working together and the importance of them ending their hostility, but Dr. Spooner questioned whether Mr. G can walk the walk, and this was exactly my impression.  Mr. G was able to tell me what the problems were and how things should be done, but he was very easily tipped into the sorts of behaviour which Dr. Spooner identified.  He was unable to see what he had done wrong, everything was everyone else's fault, and he was negative about the professionals and the mother.  On the basis of his written evidence, my impression of him in the witness box and what he said, and on the basis of what Dr. Spooner says and the failure to get Y to see her mother for the last eight weeks, I do not accept his evidence that he is never negative about the professionals or about the mother to the children, and I do not accept his evidence that he does all he can to get Y to spend the time which the court has ordered she should spend with her mother.  I conclude that although he loves both girls, and I am sure provides much of what they need, he is not consistently able to meet their emotional needs and this causes particular difficulties for X when she lives with him because her primary loyalty is towards her mother.  I am not sure if this point has been dealt with by other judges or not, but there must be no more recording of telephone conversations, or indeed any conversations.  Certainly I will not accept any bundle with any transcripts like that in any future hearing.

	Miss H gave briefer evidence, and I was impressed.  Of course she is equally to blame for the awful history, but I saw real signs of progress in Miss H and I have some confidence that she not only has made important changes which her son, Freddie, is benefiting from, so much so that the local authority are not involved with him at all, but that she has really taken in the changes which have to be made for both girls' benefit.  I also accept she has no current mental health problems and that she has acted appropriately over the recent incident when one of the girls was exposed to sexual material in another child's house.  

 

	Both parents, I am told, are committed to the work at Working Close and to the mediation process, and that is very important.  However, there is no guarantee that their progress will be at the same pace or that both parents will stick to the work.  The local authorities must be alert to this so that the failure of one parent does not bring down the other parent.  It is vital for both these girls that not only are they considered as individuals but that each parent is as well.

 

	The Guardian, Miss Senior, gave very helpful evidence.  She has thought through all the issues in this case with great care, and I accept her decision to limit her direct work with the girls as the right one in a case where the girls have had far too many people asking them questions and generally intervening.  I have listened carefully to her advice over the issue of what orders to make to confirm the placement of each girl as I have been thinking of making individual residence orders, but the Guardian persuaded me of the merit in this case of continuing the shared residence orders.  I am satisfied that the Guardian makes her recommendations based on her professional opinion about what is in the best interests of each of the girls, not just on their express wishes and feelings, which in the case of X the Guardian concedes until recently had been confused.  As I think I said at the start, the Guardian is only just persuaded that these girls should stay living with a parent and not in foster care, and I agree the decision is very finely balanced.

 

	On the central issue as to the separation of the girls, the Guardian commends to me the evidence of Dr. Spooner, with which she agrees, that it is very important for each girl to be with her primary attachment figure.  Miss Senior recognises that there are difficulties in implementing the amended care plan, which otherwise I am happy with, because a parent may not be able to afford a round trip each week to facilitate the weekends which each girl should spend with each other after the first three months.  She has proposed an alternative cycle of two in three weekends. The mother would accept that because of the money worries, but Mr. G would rather it remained weekly, the Guardian would rather it remained weekly, so would I, and I will see later what discussions have taken place on this point.

 

	My decision therefore, as I have said, is I agree with the proposal that X should move to live with her mother under a newly drafted shared residence order and that there should be a one year supervision order to R, and that Y should remain living with Mr. G under a new shared residence order and that there should be a one year supervision order to London Borough of P.  My reasons are many and are probably best addressed with reference to the check list in s.1.  As to two preliminary points, if it is not already clear, I am not saying by this order that all is well with Miss H's parenting. There is clearly room for her to improve and, in particular, to work on the relationship with Mr. G.  However, I have seen enough positive change to conclude that she can care for X at this time.  My second preliminary point is that in my judgment living with her mother as opposed to with Mr. G will best promote X's welfare, which is my paramount concern.  

 

	As for their wishes and feelings, I accept the evidence from Miss O'Connor that X has been consistent with her in saying that she wants to live with her mother since Miss O'Connor first met her in June.  Indeed, it seems that her wish to live with her stepfather was short-lived.  Miss H has also given evidence, which I accept, of X's wishes, and Miss H was brave enough to tell the court when X did not wish to live with her and to accept that Y does not wish to live with her, and I do accept what she says are X's wishes.  Mr. G has rightly pointed out that at other times X has said the opposite, but I am satisfied that her views have crystallised and she knows what she wants.  Her wishes and feelings are only one factor and I know that she is only nine but I consider that she has recently been consistent in her view that she is expressing a wish to return not just to her mother but also to her other family and friends in R, and indeed the life she used to live until May.  As far as Y is concerned, I anticipate that she will not like the decision that X will go but that cannot be central to this aspect of the decision, otherwise it is clear that Y wants to stay with her father.

 
		
	As to the children's needs, their needs have been clearly identified.  Mr. G has been meeting much of what X needs but I have already found he has not been able to meet all her emotional needs.  Miss H in the past has not met her children's physical needs but I find she is likely to be able to now.  X's educational needs will be met in R, as they were in London Borough of P, and I have said that X's emotional needs are more likely to be met by her mother, but I reiterate her needs will only be fully met if the conflict with Mr. G diminishes.  X also needs to maintain a close relationship with her sister and with Mr. G.  Y's main unmet need is to improve her relationship with her mother and for this to happen both parents have to improve the way they deal with each other and how they refer to the other parent.  Y must be allowed to love her mother even if her primary attachment is to her father.  Miss H may well need to improve her management of Y and this will be addressed in the work she is doing.  Y needs the conflict between her parents to be in the past for her and to be able to meet her potential.  She must not continue to remain living in an emotional war zone.

 

	The likely effect of any change:  They both had to undergo a great deal of change but I find that the proposed change for X now is most likely to meet her needs and it is of course a change back to what was her familiar life.  Y will have some benefits from having individual time with her father, who is her primary attachment figure.

 

	Age, sex, background, any particular characteristics:  No one has emphasised to me in this case the fact that Mr. G is not X's father.  I wholly accept that he is her psychological father and that there is a great deal of love between Mr. G and X.  However, like any other child, X has a right to be brought up by a natural parent if this is possible, and I have found that it is possible in this case and that X should be with her mother, and this is just one of the factors in my mind in making this decision.  Everyone agrees that Mr. G should retain parental responsibility for X, which is in part why there should still be a shared residence order, and I agree to that, and X must continue to be aware that Mr. G remains everything he always has been for her when she moved to Miss H's care.  

 

	I do not think I need to say anything further about the harm which each child has suffered and is at risk of suffering.  It cries out from all the papers and what I have already said.

 

	All I would add is that X must now be allowed to have a proper relationship with Y and Mr. G, and Y must be allowed to have a proper relationship with her mother.  Similarly, I have said all I need to say about the capabilities of each parent in what I have already addressed.  As Dr. Spooner has said, the girls are just young enough to recover if all that the parents have done wrong by fighting all this time is now in the past.

 

	Looking ahead, under the shared residence order the holidays need to be shared as before, though it may be sensible for neither parent to have more than two weeks at a time with the girls. Christmases should be alternated.  As for the supervision order, I approve the threshold document.  I make a one year supervision order with regard to X to R, and a one year supervision order with regard to Y to London Borough of P.

 

	I have considered very carefully whether I should make an interim supervision order in particular with regard to Y.  I have considered making interim supervision orders for both girls to see if the parental relationship is going to improve because if it does not it seems to me that care orders are necessary.  For Y, it seems to me that if Mr. G does not manage to get Y to spend time with her mother and if he does not change his attitude towards Miss O'Connor, in particular if he does not allow her to enter his house, then it may be appropriate for the court to consider making interim care orders and invite the local authority to remove Y from his care.

 

	On balance, I have decided to make final supervision orders because I want to give the professionals, who have impressed me, the best chance to make the new arrangements work, and I also want to remove the children from the court arena.  I do not think the local authority should allow things to get any worse, and if they do not get noticeably better in a matter of months I would hope that the local authorities or one of them will issue fresh s.31 proceedings.

 

	I shall make an order by consent of the parents under s.91(14) prohibiting either parent from making an application to the court with respect to either child without leave of the court for two years.

JUDGE CARR: In this case I am concerned with a little boy, L, who was born on the [a date in] 2012. His parents were Ms. F and Mr. A. It was Ms. F second child. She had a daughter F born on the [a date in] 2006 whose father is H. L was born by emergency caesarian section at 32 weeks, as Ms F was suffering from terminal cancer. Ms F was born on the [a date in]  1985 and very sadly she died a month after the birth of L on the [a date in] 2012. D was born on the [a date in] 1981. L is his first child and at the time of Ms F's death he was in a relationship with her and was aware, unfortunately, of the dreadful diagnosis that she had. Due to L's prematuaty, L was kept in hospital recovering from his prematurity until the 28th of August of 2012, when he was released into the care of his father who underwent the trauma of moving house and coping with the grief at the death of his partner. 
As a result of Ms F's terminal diagnosis her daughter F from having lived with D and obviously her mother Ms F, went to live with her maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. W. I should point out that when I call grandparents it would be fair to say that Mr. W is a step grandparent but they are in a solid marriage. They have been married for over ten years and he saw Ms F grow up and treated her as a daughter, Ms F's birth father having been deceased also. so he is a step grandparent but in reality he has treated F as his granddaughter, I have no doubt regards L the same. So L having being released into the care of his father, remained in the care of his father until he was admitted to hospital on the 14th October 2012. What appears to be uncontradicted is that his grandmother and grandfather, Mr. and Mrs. W saw a lot of L, out of the 47 days that elapsed from his release from hospital until his readmittance to hospital on the 14th October 2012 he spent 22 of those days with his grandparents and the other 25 with his father, but his father did care for him overnight. Care proceedings were issued on the release of L from hospital which occurred on the 28th December of 2012. L has remained in foster care since that date as the mechanism of going through a finding of fact hearing had to take place. The proceedings have in many respects taken time because there have been expert assessments and the like and the papers set out in detail the chronology which I do not intend to repeat here, save to say that is accurate and full. When L was readmitted to hospital which on the 14th October, it was his father who took him there and as events subsequently revealed L had suffered serious and significant injuries now known to be as a result of a shaking incidents. As matters subsequently transpired, father admitted to three shaking incidents on two occasions. L's injuries were life threatening. Today he is a little boy who has a shunt fitted to drain the fluid from his brain. He may be developmentally delayed and he has some muscular problems. All these life threatening injuries were as a result of injuries inflicted upon L by his father. When those injuries were inflicted and it seems the first occasion was some time in September and the second on the 12th October of 2012 father denied responsibility for them. That caused a huge amount of medical experts to become involved, to look at and to establish how L had suffered these injuries and essentially it was the case, urged on behalf father, that it was due to his prematurity and possibly the treatment that his mother was receiving in the form of chemotherapy to try and halt or alleviate her diagnosis of cancer. This situation continued from October 2012 through to the 24th of June 2013. As a result of maternal grandmother, Mrs. W, caring for L on the 13th October 2013, she fell under suspicion. However all the medical experts came to the clear conclusion that the injuries that L suffered was not as a result of either his prematurity or the cancer treatment his mother received whilst he was in utero. Mrs W was invited by the local authority to intervene in the proceedings, which must have been devastating for her, dealing as she was with the death of her child and all that that would have brought about.
Movement came from father in late May 2013 and the final admissions of causing the bilateral subdural haemorrhages and the bilateral retinal haemorrhages came finally on the 24th of June of 2013 when father made admissions of having shaken L on three occasions in two incidents. The notes of what he said appear in the bundle at A30 in typed form and B88 to 89 in handwritten form signed by father. I was the judge at that finding of fact hearing and as such I made the findings that all of L's injuries were caused by father shaking him on more than one occasion. 

The complicating factor in this case was that for a period of time maternal grandmother was content for father to care for his son, L. The local authority in the form of Ms Martin who is now a team leader was also content. That was the effect of the parenting assessment completed on the 11th of June 2013 (C42 to 76) hence before the finding of fact hearing. It was premised on the fact that the injuries caused by father were unintentional and there was a cautious optimism by Ms Martin as set out in her parenting assessment that father could care. Of course at that time maternal grandmother was still an intervener, although she had been notified on the 30th of May 2013 that she need no longer intervene but at the time of this parenting assessment grandmother was still under suspicion, although by the time of signing it she was no longer under suspicion. The fact of the matter was that Doncaster MBC saw fit to file what was a cautiously positive rehabilitation of L to his father without knowing the full facts arising from the finding of fact. 
As a result of father making the admissions he eventually did on the 24th June 2013 a new social worker, Ms. Cont, came into the case and had to pick it up and look at it in the light of the findings. She filed an assessment on the 2nd September 2013 which appears at C87 to 109 where she was not positive about the rehabilitation of L to father and of course by that time maternal grandmother having been put somewhat in the picture, sought to put herself forward and started to see L on a monthly basis and made it clear that she wished to be considered his full time carer. That resulted in a viability assessment (as it is called) of Mr and Mrs. W on the 11th December of 2013 and it appears at C141 to 175.
Meanwhile father had commenced a relationship in about February 2013 with Ms. O which exists to date. They have lived as a couple since July 2013 and it would be fair to say that Ms O fully supports father in his desire to care for L and has submitted herself to detailed assessment. She has had an assessment at C110 to 129 by Ms. Cont and she has co-operated fully and supports father in any way she can. The social work assessments were full, they were complete and the matter would have proceeded in that way. At the time, though, I was considering the matter post the finding of fact and I was aware that there was a cautiously optimistic assessment of Ms Martin's in June prior to the finding of fact. Of course I was not aware of the intent of maternal grandmother to come forward and seek to care for L along, obviously with L's half sister F. As such I sanctioned the following experts; a forensic psychologist Dr Briggs who specialises in risk assessment and a Resolutions report from a Bristol based firm in the form of Professor John Gumbleton. Resolutions are risk assessment social workers and the plan was to look at L's situation in tandem as to whether it would be safe to return L to father and try and rectify the position of one social worker (Ms. Martin) being cautiously optimistic and the social worker who was subsequently appointed (Ms Cont) to look after L's interests ruling that the risk was too great. Those reports appear in the E section of the bundle, in respect of David Briggs his report of the 13th of November 2013 is at E233 to 259 and the Resolutions report dated the 6th of November 2013 is at E260 to 282. There are also addendum reports and a letter from John Gumbleton. The nett impact is clearly set out effectively in those two reports and the experts did not deviate when they both gave oral evidence. Both Doctor Briggs and John Gumbleton was of the opinion that father must be viewed as continuing to pose a risk to L and therefore should not have sole or unsupervised care of L. Professor Gumbleton recommenced that this was until L was at least to three to four years old but possibly school age. 
Both experts shared the view that Ms O is a protective factor and has the intellectual capacity to appreciate risk. In particular it was Doctor's Brigg's assessment that Ms O could protect L from harm but both experts identified the longevity of the relationship between Mr. A and Ms O as a concern given that they had known each other for less than 12 months (although it is just about 12 months as of now). Both agreed that the Resolutions programme for rehabilitation would come to an end if this relationship broke down and L would be placed in the care of Ms O rather than a blood relative. Their oral evidence mirrored that of their written evidence. I have been assisted by all the advocates in this case by looking at the law and I turn to the law at this point. Formerly in the Nineteen Nineties it was the position that father would effectively have to be excluded before one would look at the grandparents. It altered in 2006 with the case of Re G [2006] UKHL 43 and it is absolutely plain now that it is a welfare consideration as a whole that I must look at and I must not elevate one above the other. The statutory position is that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. All consideration of the importance of parenthood in private law disputes about residence, must be firmly rooted in examination of what is in the child's best interests. This is the paramount consideration. It is only as a contributor to the child's welfare that parenthood assumes any significance. I am happy to say that all parties are in agreement that that effectively sets out the change in the law since that time and therefore I look at the welfare of L and the welfare checklist and it is a different situation from effectively the Re BS situation but I do accept and emphasise the three points that were made by Lord Neuberger in Re BA the Supreme Court decision of 2013 at UKSC 33 which was reiterated in Re BS (children) 2013 EWCA CIV 1146 as the matters that are relevant and applicable. So that although the child's interests are paramount, those interests include being brought up by his natural family, ideally his natural parents or at least one of them and obviously L only has one living natural parent that being his father. The relevant statute imposes a requirement that the Court must consider all available options when coming to a decision as reiterated in Re BS at paragraph 27 and that the Court's assessment of the parent's capacity to care for the child should include consideration of support that the authorities could offer to Mr. A in doing so, and that is set out in Re BS at paragraph 28. I also bear in mind the warning of Lord Justice McFarlane in re G (A child) 2013 EWCA CIV 965 against a linear approach in deciding the outcome of the application. Obviously I must look at each option and balance each against each other in a single process and as Lord Justice McFarlane said at paragraph 46, where the options for the child do not include placement for adoption or adoption the Court will apply the welfare checklist in the Children Act at Section 1(3) to the welfare evaluation. The wording of certain elements of the welfare checklist must, he suggests, involve a direct comparison of the relevant options that are being considered. For example the likely effect on L of any change in his circumstances, any harm which is suffered or is at risk of suffering and how capable each of his parents and any other person. In relation to L the Court must consider this question to be relevant in terms of meeting his needs and I must look at all matters in a holistic way. Applying that criterium and looking at the evidence that I heard, this case was listed for five days, in fact due to the advocates taking a sensible line and the court sitting very full days, it was completed in three, and also because the real dispute was between the grandparents and father (Ms O). I heard from the experts as I said. I heard from Ms. Cont who maintained her position and gave in my judgment good, clear and sensitive evidence. I obviously also heard from father, Ms O and from Mr. and Mrs. W. I also heard from the guardian. The other witnesses were essentially agreed because everyone accepted that the people put forward as the protective circle around the father were people who were reliable and their evidence was accepted, without the need for calling them. So as I indeed I must, I look at the respective positions of the parties. What is apparent looking at father's position his care of L is totally reliant on his remaining in a relationship with Ms O. They did present as a committed couple. However, the guardian in her report and Ms Cont in her viability assessment of them, did point out various factors and they are factors that it seemed to me to have some considerable weight. It depends on their staying together, it depends on Ms. O doing that which she said she will do, operating the protective circle around father. I have no reason to doubt that that is not her intention. She is an extremely child focussed young woman. She has got two boys of her own and she is in the childcare business and I have heard from her employers, details that L would be welcome there and that she is obviously a highly regarded employee. I have also on the other hand heard from the grandparents, they care for F. L and F would have been brought up together had their mother lived. Theirs is an important relationship. I acknowledge at this stage L's primary attachment is with his father, after his foster parents, but that is in part as a result of Mrs. W being in the pool of perpetrators until June 2013. There is also hanging over father the fact that the police have demanded, as they are entitled to, details of his admissions in these proceedings. A list of documents were disclosed to the police on the 1st day of this hearing which commenced on the 6th of February. As I have already set out father has had to admit that he shook L on three occasions. I do not know what the police attitude will be. I cannot speculate whether or not they will charge Mr. A with offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. If they do it could be pursuant to Section 18 which is causing grievous bodily harm with intent or they could take a view because of his psychological condition and they have had the expert reports, Doctor David Briggs sets out clearly the collision of events that occurred to cause Mr. A to behave as he did. They may well take the view that a Section 20, of simple grievous bodily harm will suffice. All that would make an enormous amount of difference if he was charged in terms of sentencing. If it is Section 18 it is difficult to see how a custodial sentence would be avoided. If it is Section 20, the custody threshold would undoubtedly be crossed but a more benign and different view may be taken. It is very difficult for me to speculate but nonetheless that aspect is hanging over Mr. A now, given that the police have finally decided to take some action. It would have been open to them to have taken action in June 2013, once the admissions were made but an embargo was put on so that matters could be properly and fairly considered at a point and I emphasise this, at a point when I considered that there was a real likelihood that this little boy, who had been badly injured, but had a parent who wanted to care and wanted to co-operate should have the opportunity of being looked at properly, hence the engagement of Resolutions and David Briggs. So that if anything the advocates and happily the Court had anticipated Re BS in this case, had it been between father and adoption. The situation of the police prosecution is there. At this stage I cannot place and I do not place significant weight on it. It is one of the factors that I have to consider. I think it will be fair to say that the social worker Ms Cont who I regard as having done a good and solid piece of work, approached it with an open mind and she was quite right to say father could not care by himself, that is the view of the experts. It is the position that father accepts it also. So Ms Cont was quite right that without Ms O this case, father's case would not have got off the ground because Doctor Briggs and Professor Gumbleton both say quite clearly that he does pose a continuing risk to L. It goes further than that because the guardian who has been involved throughout also cannot support placement of L with his father and does not support placement with father and Ms O, so all the experts in terms of the social work experts and the guardian and Doctor Briggs and Professor Gumbleton say that father poses a risk. What the experts were being invited to look at was whether or not father with the assistance of Ms O could care and the view of the experts is provided father undergoes therapy and some counselling (and I fully accept that father would undergo those, so that is not the issue in this case) and the protective features are in place then he can care. The experts were not looking at the grandparents, because they did not have to. There is no question but that the grandparents can care, and so the experts' evidence is, so far as it goes, only goes to the capacity of father with the assistance of Ms. O to care for L and if it was the old law that father had to be excluded before the Court could look at the grandparents, then one would have to look at it in that linear way but of course that is not now the law. I look at the welfare considerations of L. I look at the fact that if he goes to the grandparents he will be brought up with his sister, as indeed he would have been had his mother been alive and that is a factor that I bear in mind but overwhelmingly I have to look at the paramount interest of L. Happily come what may this is to be a kinship placement. I am not looking at a stranger adoption, that means that I have to look at this matter holistically as I have set out and on the basis of welfare considerations. So the options, considering a proper application of the welfare checklist is to look at both options. For father it is dependent wholly on Ms O and there is nothing that I have seen or read about that would tend to suggest to me that she is not entirely genuine in her desire to back up and support Mr A, but I do notice the negatives that the guardian set out and indeed Ms Cont also set out, but come what may Ms O is pivotal. There is no question about that. Doctor Briggs saw here her as pivotal but to the guardian their relationship is still in its building phase and there are the possible implications of the police investigation. There is the fact that they had a row at some point in late last year and she spent a night away. I am not for one moment suggesting that she would not have taken L with her if that had happened. I consider her to be a responsible woman. The plan is that Mr. A will be working long hours and effectively Ms. O will be the prime carer for three young children, her own two boys and L, on that scenario and in the case of L, he is a little boy who as a result of the injuries he sustained at the hands of his father has significant needs such that everyone agrees he needs better than good enough parenting and these are all factors that it is very important that the Court does not lose sight of. So effectively doing the very best that one can and highlighting the matters that I have already highlighted, and considering the whole of the checklist. Section 1(3)(d) his age, sex, background and any other characteristics of his the Court considers relevant, L is a child who suffered significant brain injury. He has a VP shunt fitted in order to drain fluid from his brain. He takes medication for epilepsy to control seizures. He may be developmentally delayed and the signs are that he probably is behind even at this time. He requires physiotherapy to strengthen his muscles. He is a premature baby and given the injuries he has suffered it is the considered view of all the experts that he requires better than good enough parenting. S1(3)(c), Any harm that he suffered; L has suffered significant harm due to his father shaking him on three occasions and there is a risk and I do not think the Court should hide behind this that L will suffer further harm if he is returned to his father's care, that is because father has still been assessed as presenting a risk to L and that risk is not alleviated simply by the Resolutions programme. S1(3)(f), How capable are each of his parents and any other person in relation to him the Court considers the question to be relevant is of meeting its needs. Mr. A has been comprehensively assessed within these proceedings. The consensus of opinion is that he is not able to meet L's needs as a sole carer, therefore the pivotal role of Ms O is crucial to his case. The guardian, and it is an experienced guardian here and also Ms. Cont consider that proposition carries too many uncertainties and variables for L. It may amount to his being placed outside his birth family if the relationship went wrong whereas if he is placed with his grandmother (with his sister F) he is in that kinship placement and whatever may be said and Miss Shaw did highlight matters that will need to be looked at and I accept that they will need to be looked at but may be looked at as part of the special guardianship, they have been positively assessed. They are caring for F and there is not criticism of them for their care of F. They have had to deal with a little girl who has lost her mother and the grief that that must entail for her. They have a proven track record. Put simply it is a risk free permanent placement. They are not an old couple. Grandmother is in her mid forties, grandfather is ten years younger. Many people have children now late, often in their mid-forties. Age cannot be used as a discriminatory factor against the grandparents and positively not against grandfather and there is no question in my mind that grandmother and grandfather were being entirely honest in saying that they realise the need for direct contact of L with his father, contact will preserve his bond and I could well see why grandfather was only ten minutes in the witness box because he came across entirely as he was found by the guardian and Ms Cont to be someone who will facilitate, will be able to stand back and ensure contact works and the love that he feels for F shone through. I make that clear, I have every confidence that L will receive a balanced and good upbringing from his grandmother and grandfather and in time will have his primary attachment to them, but will also see father. I obviously do consider grandmother. She has undergone the huge loss of losing Ms F. She has had to cope with that. She has dealt with it well. I was particularly helped by the statement from Shona Tutin. It laid to rest a lot of matters that Ms Shaw had properly probed in cross-examination. I am satisfied from that, that grandmother did try and effect a reconciliation between Ms. F's sisters and Ms F when Ms F was terminally ill. Mrs. W put behind whatever may have happened. It must be a very great loss to her that she does not see her grandson by S and it is a pity that Ms F's death has not brought the family together, but although it was probed by Ms Shaw, these things happen in families. Mrs. W gave me her take on it. I have no reason to disbelieve her. In fact I have every reason to believe her and as part of the special guardianship report which no doubt the local authority will pursue, these matters will have to be further probed. I leave it to the local authority as to when they think it is right to move L to the grandparents. I do reject any suggestion that L should not be moved sooner rather than later. He has been in foster care far too long and the reason why he has been in foster care is the time it took his father to admit responsibility and to say that L should be further kept away from a family placement is wrong. Had not the finger of suspicion fallen on the grandmother I have every confidence that the local authority would have looked immediately to place L with his grandparents and I am sorry to say father bears significant blame for his failure to face up to what he did, if he had put his son first at that time he would have said what he had done, and whilst Mr. A was being assessed allowed L to be with his sister and with his grandparents. I emphasise that is no part of my judgment against father, it is simply a factor that I want the local authority to feel confident to place L as soon as they can with his grandparents. There is no reason at all for any delay following my judgment. The range of powers under S1(3)(g) that I have available to me under the Act is that I have to consider all options. I set out that clearly. In doing so I have considered all options. I consider that placement with father is not risk free, it is a risk. It is too greater a risk when there is a risk free placement available for L with his sister, which all agree it is. The guardian agrees with the proposed level of contact to Mr. A and I can see no reason at all why it should not be supervised by Ms O in the fullness of time. I am quite satisfied that she would protect in the contact scenario, if she was not around someone would have to be found, it would be only supervised contact until L is old enough to be able to protect himself. Considering all matters as I must it seems to me that the guardian and the social worker are correct and this is not disagreeing with the opinion of Doctor David Briggs and Professor Gumbleton because they were only looking at father and they urged me, and both of them were clear, that if there was another realistic scenario, and obviously there is here, then I would have to consider it. There is such uncertainty in the proposals made by Doctor Briggs and Professor Gumbleton that it seems to me to be very clear that I should place, and place sooner rather than later, L with his grandparents and that is my clear judgment and clear view, having listened with care to a case that I have not found easy and there has been a considerable amount of evidence to digest. I am satisfied that the guardian and Ms Cont have balanced the case correctly. It is their opinion I agree with. I am asked to place under interim care orders still, I will do that. I would hope this case can come to an end very much sooner rather than later. I do not know what the plans are Ms. Hunt. Obviously I think I ought to have it back fairly soon unless you can do something composite now. I have already indicated that I give until the end of the month for Ms. Shaw to consider her position. MS. HUNT: Do I understand correctly by that then there should not be any move? JUDGE CARR: Well, there was no plan to move them. There was no plan on any view to move. There is obviously - you are entitled it seems to me to start to put your plans in force and the stay will not exist beyond the 28th of February 2014 at which time Ms. Shaw would have to apply for leave from me to appeal the judgment and I would obviously have to listen to that and form my own view but that would be on the 28th. It cannot go any longer because it may well that this is a seven day case, I do not know what your view but it did seem to me to be a reasonable request to allow 14 days.
 
 MS. HUNT: Yes. I do not try to argue that at all. JUDGE CARR: But there was no, the earliest was mid-March I thought from Ms. Cont. It was the 1st of March in the papers, so I do not see the local authority's prejudice and if, say, Ms. Shaw does get instructions to appeal, I sincerely hope that Mr A and Ms O think long and hard before they do that, but if she does then I will consider that application and consider whether or not to extend a further stay. If I do not do either of those it is to the Court of Appeal and Ms. Shaw, using her considerable skills, will no doubt try and persuade them in the event she receives those instructions. MS. HUNT: Can I be absolutely clear whether the local authority is permitted to begin a transition. That will involve..... JUDGE CARR: Absolutely. I have made that clear.
 MS. HUNT: .....a reduction in father's contact to once a week and a steady increase in the time L spends with the grandparents. JUDGE CARR: Yes. Ms. Shaw, that was my intention. MS. SHAW: Yes, your Honour. I understand your Honour's position and I think it is a compromise, is not it? 
JUDGE CARR: It is. MS. SHAW: But obviously we have heard the evidence that was not to be moved on the 1st of March. Your Honour has kindly8 granted me the extended time until the end of the month and as I say at this juncture it is not something I am saying will be pursued, it needs to be reflected upon. 
JUDGE CARR: No. You have got to have mature reflection. As I say, ordinarily I would have handed down a written judgment and posted it out, but it did seem to me with the lead that I had to take that I was best to do it orally notwithstanding it is always my practice to provide a written judgment. MS. SHAW: I am grateful your Honour. No, your Honour, I do not object to the fact that obviously the transition arrangements reflected in contact will begin and obviously if there is no application that is granted for stay or for permission to appeal then the rest of the plan will flow in any event.

JUDGE CARR: Yes, yes, it will Ms. Shaw, I am afraid. MS. HUNT: So the local authority could then file a plan by end of Tuesday setting out what the transition will be so that the people will know what will happen unless there is an application for leave. JUDGE CARR: Yes. Well, I do not think I need do anything - when is the next hearing going to be? MS HUNT: We have not talked about that. Previously..... 

JUDGE CARR: How long will the local authority to do an SGO that is really what I need to know. It has always been their intention it should be. 

MS. HUNT: Report by the end of April is currently suggested. 
JUDGE CARR: Well, I would have liked it this side of Easter, I am bound to say. 
MS. HUNT: Easter is at the end at the end of April, is not it? 
JUDGE CARR: Easter Monday - Good Friday is the 18th. I mean I do not know, I am not going to interfere with things because I do acknowledge that the probings by Ms. Shaw need looking at. MS. HUNT: Well, the middle of April, then just before the Easter break.
JUDGE CARR: I would prefer it, yes. An awful lot is known. 
MS. HUNT: Yes, that is right. 14th of April, I am not sure what day of the week that is. 
JUDGE CARR: The 14th of April is a Friday. Sorry, is a Monday. 
MISS ROGERS: Your Honour, I am sorry to rise at this point, the guardian is off for virtually the whole of April. She is back early May. I do not see that being too much of a problem, unless the Court is expecting a final position statement. 
JUDGE CARR: No. She is - I think my best bet is, Ms. Hunt can you lead discussions. I am not - it is obviously - I do not want Ms. C. to be rushed about this because if it has to be a bit later it has to be a bit later. The guardian has to have an input, does not she? Why don't you lead discussions. I think that would make sense.
MS. HUNT: Can I just raise the question of the publication of the judgment and whether how..... 
JUDGE CARR: Well, it does not have to be. That is another reason for doing it orally. Have you checked up the..... 
MS. HUNT: Well, having looked at it I would agree with respect that if - it seems to be saying if there is a written judgment in evidence..... 
JUDGE CARR: If it was written it would have to be published. 
MS. HUNT: Or you order a transcript it would have to be published. 
JUDGE CARR: I have no intention of ordering a transcript here because - I probably would have done if it had been the finding of facts, I would have ordered a transcript but not on this. I think it falls into paragraph 18. So if anybody wants one they can request and I will obviously grant, but I am not ordering it myself. That is how I read the rules, Ms Hunt. 
MS. HUNT: Yes, well, I agree and..... 
JUDGE CARR: So if anyone wants one I will gladly order one at their costs, but..... 
MS. SHAW: I think your Honour bearing in mind that I do not know what my instructions will be..... 
JUDGE CARR: Well, why do not you do it afterwards? Why do not you do it afterwards, I would have thought? I mean there is no problem about that Ms. Shaw. I take the view that I should not refuse if you ask, but you have heard, your clients have heard if you need it it can be done. I will make sure that we do not lose the tape. MS. SHAW: Thank you, your Honour. JUDGE CARR: Because they do expedite it, they won't take that long. I do not know how long I have been, probably half an hour. It is a fairly swift job and they can anonymise as I see fit. I will see you before the 28th Ms Shaw because you will have to apply (inaudible). 
MS. SHAW: Yes, your Honour.
 
JUDGE CARR: Can I suggest that if that happens you take Rachel's e-mail. And let her know because obviously I will have to deal with it and you will have to notify everyone else but it will have to be before the 28th. May I mention, on the 28th I am meant to be going down to Criminal Seminar.

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with the welfare of X who was made the subject of a care order by this court on 17th July 2013 and in respect of whom South Tyneside Council now seeks a placement order.  There is no active opposition to such an order but that does not absolve the court of the responsibility of making a determination.  The history is complex and much of it is not necessary for me to repeat for today's purposes.  X was the oldest of four children, full siblings, who were subject to care proceedings brought by South Tyneside Council, the children of Y and Z.  She has three older half siblings who were not part of the proceedings but none of whom reside with their mother.  

 

X is, sadly, a damaged and vulnerable child and that damage comes directly from her life experiences which are reflected most succinctly by the threshold findings made by the court in July last year, all but one of which were conceded by the parents, and from it one takes the knowledge that there had been significant Local Authority involvement with X's mother and the older children and then, once she formed a relationship with X's father, with them relating to alcohol and drug misuse, domestic violence and poor home conditions, all of which the children had been exposed to. There was a long history of neglect; there was a history of failure to engage with support services and not being open and honest with professionals.  There were also matters such as missed health needs and so on. 

 

The finding that was not conceded, but which was nevertheless made, was that X's father had sexually abused her and two of her siblings in really quite a serious way and that this is something that had occurred to the knowledge of the mother who had done nothing to protect it.  The effect of that abuse is apparent from a report from Dr Tyler, the psychologist, that I had read and, as I will come to, there has been further information disclosed which just heightened the concern in relation to that.

 

X was placed in foster care on 13th July 2012.  She was placed with brand new (that is to say first time) foster carers, called Vicky and Darren and she has been there ever since.  At the final hearing of the care proceedings the care plan for each child was one which included adoption by way of making a placement order and the court approved the care plan for all four children but declined to make a placement order in respect of X, unlike the other three, because of the concerns surrounding that plan, the opposition of the children's guardian, Barbara Hewitt, to it and opposition that had the support of Dr�Tyler, the psychologist.  It was clear to everyone that X needed therapeutic help.  The NSPCC was recruited to assist.  It carried out an assessment over the summer.  It concluded that the therapeutic work was likely to take a minimum of 30 or 32 weeks and it might take up to a year.  It also, critically, concluded that the foster carers were not experienced and sufficiently equipped to provide the support that X would necessarily need during such a process and recommended that it should be carried out in a placement where X was the only child.

 

Based on that assessment the Local Authority made concerted attempts to find a specialist foster placement where those conditions could be satisfied but, despite the use of external agencies and the like, those searches, unhappily, failed to reveal such a placement.  Meanwhile time was marching on.  The other three children had been placed.  I have read of the farewell contact that X had with each of them and it is, frankly, heartbreaking to read of this small girl expressing pleasure, as she did, at the finality and permanence that her brother and sisters were thereby achieving.  

 

The Local Authority has had, therefore, to re-think.  Hence, it now proposes after extensive consultation with the professionals, including with the NSPCC, that given X's age, and I think I have thus far failed to mention it but she was born on 29th April 2007 so will be 7 years old in just a couple of months time, that the priority has to be the placement and, accordingly, provided they are fully armed with all the necessary assessments and other material, an adopter should be found who is prepared to claim X and to support her through therapy and to be forever parents.  If that cannot be achieved within a period of six months, then the search should cease in the interests of finality and X should stay where she is.

 

When the NSPCC initial assessment was carried out, it provoked some quite extreme behaviour on the part of X.  In retrospect, the timing over the summer holidays was thought to have been ill-advised but hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Notwithstanding that, these foster carers have stuck by X through thick and thin and have done a remarkable job and I want to say here and now that they are thus far unsung heroes and I very much hope that they are told, because they have already indicated a commitment to undergo further training in the immediate future to support X in the meanwhile.  They are ready, willing and able with support to prepare X for a move if and when a potential adopter comes forward and simultaneously they offer to be long term foster carers if a permanent, alternative family does not emerge.  That is, in the court's judgment, quite remarkable and selfless as well as a wholly X-focused approach and they are greatly to be commended.

 

Whilst all this was going on, I should mention that X's maternal grandmother, Q, emerged as a possible family carer for the first time, none other having been identified who were suitable at any rate, at the time of the care proceedings being finalised.  Q has been screened and I have read the careful assessment prepared by the social worker which, sadly, rules her out as a family carer.  It is not necessary to go into the detail but I say only this.  It was clear, consistent really with X's almost complete ignorance of anything to do with Q who does not appear to have been a figure in her life, let alone a significant figure, Q knew very little of the background and Local Authority concerns and there was certainly evidence that there was not a full understanding even of those concerns that she had.  Perhaps most troublingly, she disclosed very serious allegations that would arguably cap anything that even appears in the schedule of findings as they were found but, notwithstanding that knowledge, had taken no action to protect her grandchildren in the care of their parents.  She has, therefore, properly been excluded and I am satisfied has accepted that, having approached it on the basis that she wanted to do what was for the best and would be guided by professionals.

 

The parents, who have not seen X since January 2013 and are subject to an order under section 34(4) of the Children Act whereby the Local Authority was granted permission not to facilitate contact between X and her parents, no longer oppose the making of a placement order.  Neither parent has attended this morning, I am satisfied that each has given their legal representatives instructions.  It must have been an extraordinarily hard decision for them to make.  It is entirely understandable that they did not feel able to come here today and notwithstanding what is said about them and what they had done and the findings that have been made against them, it is nevertheless, as Miss�Moulder on behalf of the Local Authority said, to their credit that they have adopted the position that they have which ultimately is one that puts X's interests first.

 

The children's guardian, who has been nothing if not forthright, remains concerned as to whether adoption is the appropriate course, particularly given that therapy has not occurred but has in a considered way bowed to the Local Authority's view and that of other professionals emphasising the need at this stage to finalise X's future.  To be entirely fair to Miss�Hewitt, she expresses no criticism of the Local Authority thinking as it is now presented to the court but instead she expresses a different professional opinion.  She has welcomed the work that the Local Authority has now done, as is reflected by the care plan and the final evidence and, as I say, the plan itself in its present form and thus she guardedly supports it providing the adopters are fully informed as to what it is that they are taking on, specifically saying that they ought to see Dr�Tyler's report as well as her own several reports written during the course of these proceedings and the care proceedings and also with an assurance that any prospective adopter will be adequately supported and trained, all things which the Local Authority endorses.  There is, of course, scope in many circumstances for professionals to disagree, entirely consistent with the discharge of their duties.  X's case is very much one where there is, sadly, no perfect solution and I think that the guardian's stance has been a principled one and a perfectly reasonable one and I recognise her quite proper independence of thought and pay tribute to the manner in which she has approached this.

 

When the care order was made, the Court of Appeal had not yet decided Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146.  As all concerned with children in the public law system now know, it has transformed the way that the court is required to approach cases where a placement order is sought and the President in B-S reminded courts faced with making what is a very far reaching decision indeed that, first of all, it is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for her upbringing, reminded courts that the Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33  earlier last year had used striking language as to the degree of necessity required before making such orders and of the need to explore and attempt alternative solutions.  

 

The reminder as to the assessment of the parents' ability to discharge their responsibilities does not really arise in the circumstances of this case.  What does arise is the need for proper evidence both from the Local Authority and the guardian, addressing all the options realistically possible and containing an analysis of the arguments for and against each and as well as identifying the need for a global holistic evaluation, the Court of Appeal specifically endorsing what Lord Justice McFarlane had said earlier last year in Re G [2013] EWCA Civ 965 which I will mention briefly.  It went to say that absent such evidence, the court would not be properly equipped to decide such issues and even if the 26 week timetable for care proceedings would not be met, the stakes were too high for rigorous adherence to an inflexible timetable which ran the risk of justice being denied.  That is a factor in this case; although the care proceedings were resolved, it is the fact that more than 26 weeks have elapsed since they were resolved and we still do not have finality.

 

This is, of course, a case where the holistic evaluation of the welfare stage realistically involves just two options.  No family placement exists: that is a matter of fact and concession.  So the only options that would secure X's welfare would be long term foster care or placement with a family permanently through adoption and I am quite satisfied that, in the way that the Court of Appeal said in Re B-S, the various pros and cons have been fully discussed, in particular, by the social worker in her final statement.  In talking about the evaluation in Re G, Lord Justice McFarlane specifically identified the need to evaluate any risk of harm from alternative options by any other person, namely the Local Authority as a corporate parent, and the social worker in this case has pointed out the very many features of long term foster care which are disadvantageous to a child as opposed to adoption if that can be achieved.  

 

Finally, in Re W [2013] EWCA Civ 1227 and drawing on what Lady Hale said in J [2013] UKSC 9, it seems to the court that the question which ultimately has to be asked given that the harm is identified and the source of that harm has been identified, what will be best for X?  That question needs to be determined in accordance with the welfare checklist in the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  X's immediate wishes and feelings would almost certainly be to remain with Vicky and Darren.  She is, however, amenable to an alternative and has, as has been pointed out, gone through the experience of seeing her younger siblings all go off to be placed for adoption.  Her wishes and feelings are important but they are but one factor that has to be weighed in the overall evaluation of the ultimate question, which is the welfare question as to what is best for her.  It is quite clear that X is a child with very significant emotional needs, I have touched on that already and she is a young girl who has had very difficult life experiences who needs permanence and support and finality, having been in litigation and in a state of limbo now for a very considerable period of time.  The harm to which she has been exposed has been considerable. 

 

It seems to the court that the likely effect of X ceasing to be a member of her birth family, which was one of the factors singled out for special attention by Lord Justice McFarlane in Re G, does in this case fall to be considered along with her ability to have any kind of continuing relationship with her birth family.  There is, of course, no more far reaching interference with a child or its parents' Article 8 rights than to sever the link with the birth family.  The consequences are profound, X has already had life story work and more will no doubt be necessary in the fullness of time in the event that this severance occurs.  However, this case is unusual in that, first of all, there has been no contact between X and her parents for more than a year with, I am satisfied from what I have read, positively beneficial effect so far as X is concerned.  She is described as having a disorganised attachment and having read some of the experiences that she has had, that is not in the circumstances surprising.  The section 34(4) order remains in place but it does not, of course, preclude applications being made in the future by her parents to have contact with her and, as Miss�Moulder rightly said, any such application would have to be determined on its merits and would have to consider X's best welfare interests, albeit at the present time nobody anticipates any immediate plan that such an application should be made.

 

On the other hand, X's siblings have now started to go through the process of adoption, having been placed for that and I am told that the process of applying for an adoption order is now underway.  Subject, of course, to all of the adopters concerned and two of the children have been placed together, one on their own, if X was placed for adoption we have potentially three sets of adopters but subject to that, contact in fact has good prospects of being maintained.  Were X to remain in long term foster care, provided there was no contact with the parents that may well continue but the moment the possibility of parental contact raises its head in the future, which I repeat would have to be considered on the merits, the irony is that she would have a better prospect of at least maintaining the link with her birth family by adoption because of the link with her siblings than if she remains in long term foster care which would put that relationship potentially in jeopardy.  

 

The professional view in this case is that the sibling relationship is more important than that with the parents.  Of course, one is always told that the most important lifelong relationship is between siblings and so, on the face of it, in the circumstances of this case that sibling relationship would appear to be the more important one.  If one was asked which relationship to prioritise, it would be that one.  So against a picture of the parents not opposing this course today, unusually the prospect of continued and worthwhile familial contact are ironically better, in the court's judgment, were a placement order to be made than not.  So for all of those reasons, I am satisfied that lifelong the course that is proposed is significantly the better one, this is a case where nothing else will do and that whilst the window remains open for this opportunity, X should have the chance to try and achieve permanence by way of adoption.  

 

Although the parents do not oppose this course, they understandably do not agree to it.  I am satisfied, therefore, that in the circumstances it is appropriate that their consent to the making of a placement order be dispensed with for the welfare reasons that I have identified and I thus dispense with their consent.  In so doing and in making a placement order, I direct that the report of Dr�Tyler, that the reports of the children's guardian and any other documents that the parties invite me to consider which might include the NSPCC work suitably redacted be disclosed to any prospective adopter who comes forward in respect of X.  I am going to direct Miss Moulder in drafting the order, to include a recital to the effect that if no placement is found or is in prospect by 15th August 2014, the court expects that the Local Authority no later than 12th September 2014 will file an application to revoke the placement order.  

 

I want to repeat my particular thanks to the guardian for her entirely principled response, I want to indicate my particular thanks to the social worker in this case who I know has been faced with very considerable difficulties but has produced a very thoughtful and comprehensive piece of work that has enabled these proceedings to end the way that they do today and I have already mentioned the remarkable work that has been done by these new foster carers who have, no doubt, taken on far more than they anticipated when they first put themselves forward.

Her Honour Judge Brown:



The Parties.



The court is concerned with a child F, who is nearly three years old. 



Her mother is Ms. W.  Throughout this judgment I shall refer to her as Mother or Ms W.  



Her father is believed to be a man named M H.  To date Mother has not provided the local authority or any party to these proceedings with his contact details.  He has therefore played no part in these proceedings.



The local authority is Buckinghamshire County Council.



F is represented through the Children's Guardian,  Ms. Crossby.



This matter came before me in May 2012 when I heard the final hearing of the care proceedings in respect of F.  I handed down a written judgment on 1st June 2012 and made a Care Order and a Placement Order.   This judgment should be read together with the judgment dated 1st. June 2012 in which I set out in some detail the background and history to this matter.  I will not repeat that here.



Mother appealed the orders made and the matter went before the Court of Appeal on 19th. September 2012, when the appeal was dismissed.  



Despite a Care Order and a Placement Order being made on 1st June 2012 and the appeal being dealt with by 19th. September 2012, F had not been placed for adoption by the local authority by 25th. April 2013 when Mother made her application for permission to revoke the Placement Order.  It serves no purpose for me to set out my concern and disappointment that F had not placed by this time.



Mother last had contact with F on 18.4.2013.



Once Mother issued her application, the matter came before me on 24th June 2013.  Unusually, the local authority and the Children's Guardian supported further assessment of Mother by Dr. Adshead, the adult psychiatrist who had reported in respect of Mother in the previous proceedings.  Given that the placing authority required this further evidence, I simply listed this matter again after the intended receipt of this further expert evidence. The addendum report is dated on 23rd. August 2013 and notes improvements in Mother's mental health.



Having received this report the matter came back before me for further directions on 5th. September 2013.  At that hearing, the local authority supported Mother's application for permission to revoke the placement order and sought further assessment of Mother's parenting abilities.  The Children's Guardian opposed the granting of permission at that stage.  I took the view that the issue of whether permission should be granted was not straight forward and that oral evidence would be required at a substantive hearing.  However, as the local authority, the authority with the responsibility for placing F, considered that further assessment was required before proceeding to place F, I adjourned M's application pending receipt of the report from the Court Assessment Service, making no findings or giving any indication of the merits of Mother's application for permission to revoke the Placement Order.  The Children's Guardian was concerned about the delay on F of this assessment but took a realistic view that given the stance of the local authority, the assessment must proceed.



The report was completed by Ms. Smith of the court assessment service and is dated 7.11.2013.  Ms. Smith does not make a recommendation as to whether the Placement Order should be revoked or not but sets out the strengths and weaknesses of Mother's arguments that there has been a sufficient change in her circumstances to warrant further assessment.



Having received the report of the court assessment service, the position of the local authority is that permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order should not be granted.  This stance is supported by the Children's Guardian.  The matter therefore needed to be set down for a substantive hearing.  The matter has come before me over four days, far longer than such an application would normally take to be litigated.  



I say at once that I have found this a difficult case, as I did the initial care proceedings.  I have therefore allowed a great deal of latitude to enable Mother fully to put her case and I heard from a number of witnesses, namely;

Ms. C, (Mother's therapist), Dr. Adshead, (adult psychiatrist), the maternal grandfather who I have referred to as MGF, Mother's partner Mr. B, the maker of the court assessment report Miss Smith, Mother, the social worker Ms. Chambers and the Children's Guardian Ms. Crossby.



Therefore at the commencement of this hearing the position of the parties was as follows.



On behalf of mother it is submitted that she has made sufficient changes to meet the first stage of the test required for permission to revoke a placement order and that given the evidence of mother's improved mental health difficulties, mother's prospects of success of revoking the placement order are sufficiently high that  that permission should be granted and further assessment undertaken.



The key changes relied upon are as follows;



Her improved mental health.

Her stable relationship with Mr. B to whom she is engaged to be married, the wedding being due to take place in May 2014. They met through a website in August 2012.

The fact that her oldest son TM has moved back from his grandparents to live with her.  He had lived with his grandparents from June 2007 until June 2013.

Her improved relationship with her parents, in particular with her mother.

She lives in new accommodation which is not specially adapted for any disabilities.







On behalf of mother it is submitted that there should then be a further period of assessment in the following terms.  It is expected that there would need to be a period of introduction between F and M as the last contact was in April 2013.  The local authority and the children's Guardian submit that a psychological assessment of mother's fianc� Mr. B would be required.  It is accepted by all parties that although mother has made significant improvement in her physical functioning, mother would not be able practically to care for F without a substantial package of physical support and therefore a thorough assessment by the complex needs team would be required.  It is accepted on behalf of mother and forcefully submitted on behalf of the local authority and the children's Guardian that the further assessment required before there could be any question of placing F back with Mother, would be between four and six months.  Clearly F would have to be increasingly involved during this period of assessment.



The local authority and the Children's Guardian accept that whilst there have been changes for Mother, they are not of a sufficient degree or as the Children's Guardian puts it, "the right changes" to cross stage one of the two stage test required at the permission stage.  Both submit that mother's application should fall at this stage and that I do not need to consider stage two namely the "prospects of success stage."  However, it is submitted that if I find that stage one is crossed, the prospects of success are so low particularly when balancing F's welfare, that I will be driven to the conclusion that permission must not be granted.  The Children's Guardian in particular is strongly of the view that there must be no further delay for F in making decisions about her long-term placement.  



F was placed with her current Foster carers when she was four days old.  Consideration was given to these carers being considered as adoptive carers after the placement order was made.  However there were concerns about the proximity of these carers to mother's home and as I understand it, they were therefore rejected as prospective adopters.  However they have been reconsidered by the local authority and they are due to be considered at a matching panel on 24th. February 2014.  On the basis that they are approved as prospective adopters and depending on the judgement of this Court, the placement of F with them will change to a formal placement for adoption and the local authority will support their application for adoption of F.  Therefore the plan of the local authority, strongly  supported by the Children's Guardian, is that F should remain in her current placement for the rest of her minority as an adopted child and that the settled placement in which she is thriving will be secured.  The local authority, supported by their children's Guardian, submits that a long and rather drawn out process of further assessment which they say would be required would be deeply disturbing and upsetting to F, would be emotionally harmful to her and this risk of emotional harm to F is not merited when considering what they argue are low prospects of success.



The evidence.



I turn firstly to considering the evidence in this case.

The first witness I heard from was mother's therapist who for reasons of confidentiality I will refer to as Ms. C.  



Ms. C filed a report dated 30.5.2013.  She has been working with mother since 3.5.2012 and sets out in her report the work that she has completed with mother. She writes,

" as a result of the above treatments, Ms. W has improved considerably over time.  I am very pleased with her progress, while I am not a diagnostic psychiatrist, I have completed psychopathology professional development training and my assessment is that Ms. W no longer meets all the necessary criteria needed to fall within the borderline personality diagnosis as described in the DSMV."



She continues, "Ms. W is able to see her relationships with others in a more flexible and understanding way now and as a result has been able to let go of a role as victim.  This has been one of the hardest parts of therapy for Ms. W.  Understandably the circumstances in relation to her children have not helped her however we have done a significant amount of work to help her to empathise with others.  When Ms. W first came to see me she felt that she was being victimised by the authorities, by her mother and by her ex-partner Mr. H.  We have progressively worked to help Ms. W to understand and see things from the other perspective.  She seems readily able to do this in all except her relationship in regards to her ex-partner, however having known Ms. W for some considerable time now and have been seen evidence of her ex-partner's continuing aggressive attitude towards her, this does not surprise me and I think she may well be prudent in remaining cautious."



Ms. C writes further on in her report,

"Ms. W also continues to maintain a strong and stable relationship with her other children, consistently putting their needs before her own."



"Ms. W has shown that she is able to keep her mood stable despite the very difficult circumstances.  She has continued to attend all her sessions even after the court case deciding the outcome of the children's care was resolved.  I predict that Ms. W will continue to improve.  She is forming stable relationships and is in fact engaged to be married to a man who appears to be a stable decent moral Christian, he is aware of all of Ms. W's past and is supportive of her."  Any impulsive behaviours that were diagnosed a year and a half ago no longer appear to be present.  Ms. W does still on occasion need advice as to how to deal with certain situations however she is happy to ask for this and takes advice well."



In evidence Ms. C confirmed that she had started to work with mother from March 2012 initially for twice weekly sessions reducing down to weekly sessions from March/April 2013.  Ms. C told me that mother, "engages extremely well and does "all her homework that she is set."  In her view Mother has,

"improved enormously."  Ms. C told me that when she first started working with mother there were frequent phone calls as well as these sessions but she said, "I've had no phone calls outside of the sessions for a whole year."



The therapy has focused on problem-solving and feeling empathy for other people. Ms. C believes that this work has enabled her to change her reactions to her mother and therefore improved that relationship.  Ms. C explained when Ms. W was with her mother, she would react in a childlike way but this dynamic has now changed.  Ms. C reported that in her view, Ms W's relationship with her mother is now stable and good.



Ms. C told me that she has done a lot of work with mother to try and help improve the ability to work with professionals and has assisted mother in understanding the perspective of social services.  In Ms. C's view, mother has made enormous improvement in all of these areas and she repeated her opinion in her written report that at the present time mother is not showing any traits of a borderline personality disorder.  Summarising she said, "We've improved her relationship with her mother, she is less of a victim and she is able to process things without blaming other people, she is in a stable relationship with her partner and her mother and she has made a number of friends to."  In relation to her progress Ms. C told me that mother tends to make great inroads and then plateau and then makes progress again but she told me this is normal and that this has been a constant pattern since 2012.  Ms. C told me that she is confident that mother will continue with therapy whatever the outcome of this case and she made the important point that mother continued to engage in therapy despite the making of the care and placement order and post the Court of Appeal decision.



Ms. C has also seen mother's fianc� Mr. B in one session.  Ms. C told me that Mr. B engaged very well and seemed to be very aware of what difficulties there may be in the relationship.  



Ms. C has not met mother's former partner Mr. H.  Ms. C told me that in her view Mother has "progressed enormously in this area although mother still has concerns about his attitude towards her." 



One of the concerns expressed by Dr. Adshead, in her report namely that mother would bring F into the conflict between her other three children and Mr. H, Ms. C.   told me that in her view in the last six months, mother has tried very hard not to draw the children into that.



Ms. C accepted that most of her information was self reported from Ms. W but she was keen to emphasise that she does not take everything said to her by Mother at face value.



Ms. C expects M to be in therapy for a further 6 � 12 months.



It is important to note that Ms. C had not seen my judgment or the rest of the court bundle.  She was asked to read the report of Ms. Smith prior to commencing cross examination.



At the beginning of cross examination, Ms. C told me that Mother had raised with her all the keys issues raised within Ms. Smith's report and she has worked with Mother to address them.

Asked about Mr. H's attitude towards her Ms. C accepted that Mother still believes that Mr. H is acrimonious towards her but that Mother is not 100% convinced  about the causes of the accident.  Ms. C's opinion is that Mother is now more "balanced" in her view of Mr. H.   Ms. C told me,

"When she first came to see me she was absolutely convinced that he was involved and her view has changed that he may be involved � she's more pragmatic about it."  Ms. C told me that Mother's beliefs that the police were in a conspiracy with Mr. H have, "never been conveyed to me."  Nor has Mother conveyed to Ms. C that social services were in a conspiracy with Mr. H.



Ms. C was cross examined about Mother's "dishonesty" as the local authority sees it, when giving false information to professionals.  A great deal about this will be said in due course.  However, of interest to me was Ms. C's view that,

"Therapy is normally a very honest relationship � I think it unlikely that someone would be consistently dishonest � most clients come with an honest perspective � it is generally an honest relationship."  I specifically clarified with Ms. C that was her view as I was anxious that I had made an accurate note of that particular opinion.



In respect of the specific questions put to Ms. C, understandably she did not feel able to comment on the specific examples relied upon by the local authority.



Ms. C told me that in her view Mother's opinions are now, "more balanced" and that they are not, "black or white but are "shades of grey."



Ms. C told me that although Mother has never expressed a view that social services are in any sort of conspiracy she believes there is a bias towards F being adopted because it is , "too expensive" to have F placed back with her.



A particular part of the evidence in relation to Mother's contact with one of her children T was put to her.   This paragraph has been referred to often throughout the hearing and therefore I shall set it out in full.  It is part of Ms. Smith's statement and relates to a contact between Mother and three of her other children.



"Ms. W told me that after I had left the contact T asked why her mother had not seen them on the last contact date of 28th. September.  T said that her father had told them that the contact was cancelled by their mother as "she had something better to do."  Ms. W explained to T that this was not the case and "snapped" saying something she should not have said.  She told T that her father had stopped the contact as he was "blackmailing" her, claiming he had not received maintenance payments.  S and C were not part of the conversation; Mr. B sat quietly in the room and listened�.

Ms. W spoke of her feelings towards T.  She said, "My daughter feigns affection towards me, she tells lies about me to A (Mr. H's partner) and Mr. H."  Ms W believes that T has told them that during contact, she (Ms. W) spends time in bed.  Ms. W said, "she is turning into her father's daughter I'm afraid."  She said Mr. H surrounds himself with women, he is charming and brain washes them.  She described T as being "quick to be aggressive."  She said that T was helping the twins to assemble one of their birthday toys and T shouted at C asking her if she wanted help or not threatening to break the toy.  Ms. W said that S has no confidence and said,

"They will all turn into T, they will hate me."  S and C told her that T "hates her."



Ms. C told me that Mother had told her about this and said,

"we did talk about it and she felt awful about it and felt really quite distressed � she really felt bad it had happened."



Asked about Mother stating that T "feigns affection, " Ms. C said, "If she said that, that troubles me � I don't think a child would feign affection � What Ms. W thinks is that T is torn between the two of them."



Ms. C told me that she "had challenged" Mother about recording her contact with her children.



In re-examination, Ms. C was asked about her views that the therapeutic relationship is usually "honest."  Ms. C told me that she expected patients to tell her the truth, "as they perceive it to be," and that everyone has a different map of the world.  She said, "I don't accept this map of the world as being genuine or correct.  It's occurred to me that Ms. W could have been faking good.  In my opinion she has been candid in the sessions."



I then heard from Dr. Adshead.  In her addendum report she writes the following,

"I have been asked to comment on whether Ms. W has made progress.  I have noted the contents of Dr. L's reports and the reports of Ms. C.  I would agree with these clinicians that there seems to be some clinical improvement.  This would be entirely consistent with my 2011 assessment which was that Ms. W had a treatable personality disorder.  I took the view then that she could make progress if she was offered appropriate therapy and I agree with Ms. C and with Ms. W that (having engaged in treatment) she has made progress.

I believe that she still has some symptoms of personality dysfunction, but there has (in my view) definitely been some degree of remission; and the condition is less severe than it was.  I think she will need to continue to work in therapy; especially to address the on-going difficulties with her ex-husband.  I think there is some shift in her belief that she is in danger from him, but she is still engaged with him in a profoundly negative way."



Dr. Adshead then addresses one of the key issues in the case, namely Mother's ability to accept and co-operate with a package of practical support to assist her in caring for F.    She writes,

"It appears that Ms. W's attitude has softened somewhat and she is saying that she will work with social services to "co-parent" F.  I am mindful that Ms. W does not find co-parenting with her ex-husband easy; and I am concerned she may not find it easy to work with social services, if this option were pursued."



Dr. Adshead concluded this report as follows,

"In summary I would suggest there is evidence that Ms. W has made psychological improvements and has better affect regulation and better sense of responsibility and agency.  According to her therapist she sees herself less as a victim and is therefore less frightened and antagonistic towards others.  It remains to be seen whether this change will manifest itself in relation to social work professionals."



In oral evidence Dr. Adshead stood by her report and did not wish to make any alterations to her conclusions.  She stated the following,

" I thought there have been changes.  If one looks back to 2008/2010 there has been a great deal of change, clearly mother does not have such a disordered state of mind as she had back then, for example there are far less contacts with the police services.  Ms. W's mental state has definitely improved and it is consistent with what I hoped would be the case with treatment.  There was a mild to moderate degree of dysfunction and this has improved with treatment and I am pleased to see there has been some improvement.  Since 2011/2012, it is apparent that there are areas where Ms. W has made improvement - she has an improved relationship with her mother, the evidence is that this is less rigid.  However what concerns me is that she can present themselves in different ways in different situations and to different people.  My interpretation is that generally Ms. W is managing her anxiety much better than she was as she is less distressed and frightened.  My impression from reading the materials is that when she is in a situation where she feels anxious or challenged she reverts back to being antagonistic or rigid.

When she is with her therapist she is able in that environment to be thoughtful and reflective about her difficulties but in situations where she feels more anxious there are possibilities for her to be more defensive again and what she says in those situations is less insightful or thoughtful."



Dr. Adshead told me that over time people who are  suffering from a borderline personality disorder can improve their capacity to regulate thoughts and feelings, which could improve their ability to make and maintain relationships and which will also improve their sense of well-being.  However she stated that the best analogy to understand this is considering a patient with diabetes where the patient suffers from a disregulation of glucose control.  The diabetes can be controlled but the patient still has diabetes.    Dr. Adshead told me that in her opinion, Mother had a mild to moderate degree of personality disorder which was much worse in 2004/2005.  Dr. Adshead this may have deteriorated due to depression after the birth of the twins and that with the passage of time and with therapy her mental state has greatly improved.  Dr. Adshead accepted that, having listened to the evidence of Ms. C, Mother has worked hard in therapy and this has paid off with an improved capacity for mood regulation.  Dr Adshead also stated that mother's ability to have positive relationships may have improved given that she has a new relationship with a partner and that her relationship with her mother is improved.



Asked about mother's risk of relapse Dr. Adshead told me,

" it is real but very difficult to say what the size of risk or the time scale of that risk is."  Dr. Adshead told me that if Mother were to become depressed then the risk of relapse would be higher.  She told me that the triggers for relapse are developing clinical depression, emotional disruption in a relationship, bereavements, illnesses or any situation which causes extreme or intense anxiety  or psychological pain.  Dr. Adshead concluded this report as follows,

	

She told me that in a disregulated system a sudden big challenge could disrupt a remission which has been established.



In terms of whether Dr. Adshead saw F not returning to Ms. W's care, or returning and Mother having to cope with a three year old, Dr. Adshead saw both as potential stressors and could not put one higher than another.



Under cross-examination on behalf of mother, Dr. Adshead told me that she accepted that mother had received appropriate therapy and that the real gains in such therapy will have been made in the first 18 months to 2 years.  She told me that there is not much evidence that prolonged therapy after that period of time brings about significant change.  

Dr Adshead was asked about the past reports of Dr. Lowenstein and Dr. Holt.  Dr. Adshead told me that where she disagrees with Dr Lowenstein, is that he seems to have a rather "old-fashioned view" of personality disorder, namely that you either have it or you do not .  In Dr. Adshead's opinion, it is perfectly possible to have some degree of personality disorder and  become better or worse and that there is a spectrum of symptoms.

It is perhaps important to note that Dr. Adshead remains certain of her view that her original diagnosis that mother has a treatable borderline personality disorder is the correct diagnosis and that has proved to be the case as Mother has shown improvements with appropriate therapy.  Dr. Adshead repeated that Mother has made improvements since 2008 and she is "cautiously hopeful" that Mother can maintain the gains she has made.  Asked if she is optimistic about Mother's continued progress Dr. Adshead said,

" I am not not optimistic -  mother has made an engagement made gains.  I'm not sure I have a view about what will happen next but I accept it is likely she will continue to engage in therapy."  She repeated that the greatest gains that people make are in the first 18 months of therapy and that any further gains after that are smaller and over a longer period.  Dr. Adshead noted that the two areas where Mother has made less gains are her negative feelings towards her ex husband and her continued suspicion of social services.

Dr. Adshead also conceded that there may have been improvement in Mother since she saw her for assessment in August 2013, since she has continued with her therapy.  In short Dr. Adshead accepted that mother has developed some insight over the last two years with therapy.



Under cross examination by the local authority, Dr. Adshead pointed out that she is giving evidence as an expert in psychotherapy of people with personality disorders whereas Ms. C is a therapist actively involved in the treatment of such a patient.  She was clear that she was not ranking that level of expertise but simply pointing out the difference of perspective.  Dr. Adshead was also asked about Ms. C's opinion that therapy is usually an "honest" relationship.  Dr. Adshead did not consider this necessarily to be the norm but pointed out that she very frequently works with people who are law breakers.  She also pointed out that people have therapy for many different reasons, some feel under pressure, some have very mixed feelings about it.



Dr. Adshead told me that Mother may engage so well with Ms. C because she is in the safety of a therapeutic relationship in which she is able to appreciate that people are not as against her as she believes.  Mother is able to reach out for help to a therapist.  This is a very different focus to working with social services.



Dr. Adshead was asked about a reported comment by Mother about part of her report.  In her report Dr. Adshead wrote the following,

E17 paragraph 12,

"Ms. W told me that she had a new partner Mr. B whom she had met on line.  She said that they were engaged and hoping to marry next year, he said that he had split up from his wife and had two sons aged seven and nine.  Ms. W said that Mr. B's ex-partner was also rather controlling and manipulative, like her ex-husband.  She said that she liked Mr. B because he seemed, "so normal."  She went on to say that Mr. B had regular contact with his children and that she hoped that the boys would come and live with her and Mr. B after they were married.  She told me that she feels she has made a bond with Mr. B's eldest son who has just been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome and has been seeing a counsellor."



In the report of the social worker carrying out of the court of assessment service report at E40 paragraph 4.1.10, the following is reported,

" she agreed to a psychological assessment, 8.5 hours over 3 days, she thought she was doing really well.  Referring her to Dr. Adshead's comments about Ms. W and Mr. B's plans to have his two sons lived with them, Ms. W said she did not say this, it had been misconstrued.  In her opinion what was asked of her by Dr. Adshead was if some awful tragedy befall their mother, would she and Mr. B take care of them and in those circumstances she replied of course they would."



Dr. Adshead denied that she had asked Mother this question and was clear in evidence that Mother had said that which she had reported in her report.



She told me very clearly that she would not have asked what they would do if a tragedy befell the mother of Mr. B's children.



Of Mr. B, Dr. Adshead pointed out that it is very important that he knows of the diagnosis and really understands how this impacts upon how Ms. W may react.



Dr. Adshead pointed out a part of Mother's statement which caused her concern.  At C63 of Mother's statement she writes,

"I am not blind to the fact that my physical disadvantages might mean that both F and I will have to make adaptations to how we work on a daily basis and that there will be times when I will have to rely on others for support but this should not be a bar to F being placed in my care."



Dr. Adshead pointed out that three year old children do not "make adaptations" and she is concerned that Mother would expect too much of F.



Dr. Adshead expressed her concern that the intense challenge of being a care giver to this three year old child may trigger a relapse and pointed out that this may have been one of the factors in Mother's decline in mental health in 2008 after the birth of the twins and when a single parent to four children.  She is very concerned about the effect on Mother of caring for a three year old whose attachment is disrupted and who may not be a biddable easy child to care for.  Dr. Adshead told me,

"I would describe it as a stressor that might stretch Ms. W's capacities more than she anticipates."



Dr. Adshead told me that one of the concerns she has about Mother's attitude which is quite pervasive is that Mother believes people lie about her and this has an impact upon her ability to work with third parties.



I then heard from Mother's father who I shall refer to as MGF.  I had the opportunity to hear him in evidence in the previous proceedings.  I was told the  maternal grandmother was unwell with a cold and therefore could not give evidence.

MGF told me that Mother's relationship with her mother has improved and is now a "normal relationship."  They see each other "quite often" and Mother spent Christmas with her parents which went well whereas before, "it was under stress."  Mother's oldest child TM (16 years old) now lives with M.  He is reported to be doing well and he sees his grandparents at least once per month.



In terms of what the grandparents could offer, MGF told me that he and his wife would be prepared to move down to the Aylesbury area to be near Mother.  They own two houses in Lincolnshire, one is rented out.  They would sell both houses in order to buy a house in the more expensive area.  They also have a daughter who lives in Buckinghamshire who has a child.  MGF considered that he could offer between 15 � 20 hours a week of support.  The MGF told me that he would be prepared to intervene if he considered that Mother was not acting in the best interests of F as he has done so in the past (as set out in the previous judgment.)



MGF told me that has been a gradual improvement in particular in how Mother relates to her Mother.

MGF told me that at the moment contact between Mother and the children is suspended.  AT first MGF told me this was because Mother had not paid �5 per week towards child maintenance the backlog is now running at �250.  Contact has been suspended since October 2013.  MGF told me that he has tried to broker an agreement and has now instructed solicitors.  When pushed MGF accepted that the other reason for a suspension in contact is because, "she was supposed to have said something inappropriate to the children."  Ie the comment already referred to that Mr. H was "blackmailing mother."  In fact it was established that contact resumed after the first disagreement about maintenance and stopped again after the comment.  The real reason therefore seems to be that in Mr. H's mind, mother has spoken inappropriately at contact.



After the contact MGF took the children back to Mr. H's home.  T apparently told her father what Mother had said.  He is reported to have said,

"T has just told me that Mother said I was a blackmailer � I'm not having that � all contact are off and he told me to f off."



The situation is now that these three children are not seeing their Mother, grandparents or their older sibling TM.  MGF told me that he had not noticed any problems in the relationship between T and Mother.  It was put to him that Mother had said that T "feigns affection".  MGF told me, " I don't look at things in that light � I wouldn't have said that � she seems to interface with her quite normally.  Perhaps Mother expects more from the children than normally a child would give to an adult.  My wife gets on well with the children but they don't show a lot of affection."



MGF told me that in effect he and his wife would be prepared to "do what grandparents do."



Asked on behalf of F what support he would actually give he told me,

"I can't see what we would need to support her for � if I'd have more of an opportunity to think about it � she does have a physical disability � at times this inhibits her � it takes a while for her to get ready to go out."



PGF told me,

"My wife and I want to keep F in the family � we will do what is necessary � we are not sure what that is."



In terms of practical arrangements MGF told me that he had only just signed a one year lease on one of the properties and therefore if required to move down he and his wife would rent first before selling the two properties and buying a house in the local area.  He accepted that moving down would mean he lived in a "much less attractive home in a much less attractive area."



MGF told me that Mother's relationship with her other sister remains very strained and they do not have contact.



MGF told me Mother can walk around her home and he has seen her walk up to 15 metres.  She cannot stand for long periods and has to sit down because she is weary.    Mother could not walk F to the park, she would have to be in a wheelchair and F in a buggy.  Mother takes a long time to get ready and needs to take a lot of medication.  Mother cannot move around the house quickly.



MGF told me that he likes Mr. B and approves of the relationship.  He told me that he finds the idea of F being adopted as, "intensely disturbing."  He told me that forced adoption is, "crude and barbaric."



I then heard from Mr. B (mother's partner.)  Mr. B has filed two statements both of which I have read.  Mr. B had been given the opportunity at the beginning of the hearing to read through the bundle.  He told me,

" it gave me a lot of headaches, there was a lot to read but I have a better knowledge of Mother's past and her personality disorder."

Mr. B told me that he and Mother are planning to get married on 17th. May 2014.



Mr. B told me that he has a very good relationship with MGF.  He told me that he has two children who are now ten and six years old.  He separated from their mother two years ago.  He was greatly involved in their care when living at home and immediately post separation. 



Asked about mother, Mr. B told me that she is a very good communicator and described her as "well balanced" in her character and "very co-operative."



He told me that he considers mother to be "very patient and good at picking up how her children are feeling"



Asked about her ability to cope with Mr. H, he told me that she does not react with anything he comes up with and does not rise to any of the problems.  Mr. B was aware that mother had told one of the children that  "he's blackmailing me".  Mr. B told me that he was present at that time and that mother was, "very very regretful.  I think she realised it as soon as she said it."



Mr. B accepted that he told the social worker when he first met her that he did not have any children of his own.  He told me the reason for this was because he did not want them dragged into anything else and that it was for their protection.  He told me that he sees his role in respect of F as one of co-parenting and supporting mother.  He intends to continue with his employment but would do as much as he could within the home outside of working hours.  He told me that if he saw anything which concerned him in respect of F he would challenge it straight away and ask why Mother had said or done it. Asked what he thought the impact may be on mother of parenting a three-year-old who may be difficult cause a relapse in Mother,  Mr B said,

" I don't think that would happen - she is very good at working under pressure - emotionally she is very stable - if she has F back there can be no greater motivation than that - if anything happen I would be there to support her and my priority will be F.  F would be my main concern  -  I don't know what else to say."



Under cross examination Mr. B accepted that he didn't really know very much about a borderline personality disorder but told me that in his view it does not affect her very much now at all.  He told me that mother is not a negative person, she has changed for the better since he has known her, that she is patient in any life situation, doesn't let things bother her and that if she does react it is only slightly.  



It was put to Mr. B that the reason mother gave him as to why her children were initially removed, namely that she had accommodation problems, was not really true.  Mr. B told me that he did not think they should have been removed from her care.  He told me that the person he read about in some of the reports is,

" a totally different person to the person I know now."



Mr. B was asked about his own children.  At first mother met his two children during his contact.  A vicar then told Mr. B's ex wife that his new partner had had five children removed from her care.  Given that information, Mr B's ex wife stopped contact unless Mr. B would undertake that the children would not be brought into contact with mother, until she knew more about the situation.  Mr. B took exception to this and there then followed a period of 6 months when Mr. Beer only had indirect and telephone contact with his boys, despite his ex wife being prepared to permit contact in the absence of Ms. W.  Mr. B told me this was "out of principle."

Asked how this stance affected his boys Mr. B said,

"I don't know � they seemed OK � I felt it was the right thing to do."  Mr. B told me that he had explained to one of his children that the reason he was not having direct contact with them was because,

"Mummy is not letting you see [Ms. W] because she doesn't like her and I am trying to sort something out."



When later challenged as to whether he thought this was really the right thing to tell his son, he told me that he thought it was.  According to Mr B, his sons reaction to having contact stopped was that he was, "very angry because he got on so well with[Ms. W.]"



Mr. B also told me of his anger towards the vicar who had alerted his ex wife to the concerns about Ms. W.



Asked about the exchange between mother and T at contact, Mr. B accepted he was present and that he heard the exchange and accepted he did not intervene because, "it wasn't my place."  The only criticism Mr. B would make about the whole situation was, " I think it was out of line for Mr H to tell T that which was untrue."  

Asked about mother's comment that F "feigns affection", Mr. B commented that T was more distant than the other children and was not as affectionate.



Mr. B was asked whether he believed that mother's car accident was caused by Mr H.

The short answer to that question is that Mr B does believe mother when she has told him that Mr H caused or was responsible for involving others in causing an accident.



Mr B believes that Mr H paid somebody deliberately to smash into mother's car.  At the time of the accident there was another passenger in the car.  I asked Mr. B whether he really believed that Mr H would be able to convince someone to get into a car with somebody else (either with or without their knowledge) with the express intention of smashing into mother's car to kill her or cause her serious injury.  I gained the impression that Mr B had not really considered the facts as presented by mother in any great detail but had simply accepted mother's strongly held view that she was the victim of this conspiracy.



Mr B told me that one of the reasons he believes mother is because on the several occasions they have discussed this accident she has been able to give the same details every single time. It was put to Mr B that he had told Ms. Smith that the police were probably involved in a cover-up as well (E47) but when challenged about this he said that he could not remember saying that.



Mr B told me that he and mother did challenge each other if they disagreed with each other and that they would talk things through.



I then heard from Ms. Smith.



She has filed and served an assessment report which is at E35 of the bundle and runs until E88.  I say at once that I found Ms. Smith's written report of enormous assistance.  It is long and detailed and I do not see the benefit of transcribing lengthy parts of it into this judgment.  It needs to be read in its entirety.  It presents the positives and negatives of the case put by Mother at this time.



Of concern in the report is Mother's continued belief that she was the victim of a conspiracy to kill her and persecution my Mr. H.  I have no evidence from Mr. H and have never seen him give evidence.  I therefore have no first hand account of his side of this long running story.   Whilst it may well be that Mr. H is a very difficult man who behaves unpleasantly towards mother and her parents, Mother's view of Mr. H is extreme.  I was particularly struck by paragraphs 4.1.1 through to 4.1.2o E39 � 42.  The examples that Mother gives go far beyond the normal concerns that are so often raised between parents who have difficulties in communicating about their children over contact issues.  Mother still appears to be of the belief that Mr. H has had her followed, has tried to kill her and that she appears hyper vigilant of people around her who may be connected to Mr. H, believing that a nurse who treated her in hospital and a woman at a petrol station, are both associates of Mr. H.  In the case of the nurse, Mother believes she felt  some malicious intent towards her.  In this regard I refer particularly to paragraphs 4.1.19 and 4.1.20 E42.



Miss Smith addresses what for me remains a key concern in this case namely,

"In my opinion, any professional working with Ms. W must be aware of her mental health diagnosis the gains that she has made in therapy and the treatment that remains outstanding.  Ms W has certain personality traits and communication style.  She may at times appear hostile and dismissive when perhaps she's feeling intimidated, not heard or dismissed.  Mr B described this as a defence mechanism.  She may appear to be stubbornly rejecting of advice or guidance.  I have not seen this myself but I have not had to deliver this form of professional advice.  There is a theme in her account of past events of her feeling victimised, veiled by multiple agencies, that was not her fault.  She still has a tendency to view others as being in the wrong.  Her thinking remains rather rigid on these subjects.  She does not appear to have reflected on the path and considered whether she had made any contribution or taken responsibility for any of the difficulties she encountered."  E73.



Asked about Mr B's attitude towards contact with his own children, Miss Smith told me that she is concerned that he sought to prioritise his relationship with mother over that with his boys.  Asked about the issue with T in contact, Mr. B gave the impression that he was irritated with the child and places some responsibility on her for telling her father what mother had said.  Ms Smith told me that mother had not expressed any regret or remorse for the way she had spoken to T.  She felt uncomfortable with the way mother spoke about T and was particularly concerned by mother's comment that T, "feigns affection."  Ms Smith had concluded in her report that the relationship between mother's three children (who live with their father) and herself is, "bleak."  



Miss Smith told me that in her view what mother had said to T in contact was not acceptable but that the impact on T appears to have been lost.  She did not seem to have understood that T had been placed in an impossible position.

She told me that Lincolnshire social services where the three children live have had no contact with them since December 2011.



Ms Smith told me that during the assessment she saw in Mother symptoms of paranoia and of mother continuing to believe that she is a victim.  She is concerned that mother's rigid thinking continues particularly have a fixed view that the local authority cannot be trusted.  In her view it would be challenging for the local authority to work openly and honestly with mother.  Ms Smith was concerned about the information mother had given to the complex care team.  The assessment of the complex care team is in the bundle at aC47.  I say at once I have not heard from the author of this report who is  Ms James. 



However at C55 under the date 17th. April 2013, there is a section which reads as follows,

"Ms. W said she had both her children at home living with her.  TM is 16 and F is 2.  F goes to her aunty in [ ] and during the day TM is at school in [ ].  A friend Mr. T completing most of the practical task within the home including helping F to bed.  Ms. W informed me that her friend Mr. T is living there and is completing most practical tasks to support her and helps with caring for children."



In a further part of the report dated 14th. May 2013, there is a paragraph which reads as follows,

"Updated information from Sonia Chambers, Children's Team.  Ms. W's children do not live with her.  Her son lives with her grandparents in Lincolnshire and her daughter lives in Aylesbury with plans to be adopted."



Miss Smith had addressed this section of the report both directly with Miss James and with Mother and I have paid particular attention to paragraphs 4.11.4 and 4.11.5 E68.  In oral evidence Ms. Smith confirmed once again that she had spoken with Ms James, that what she had written was an accurate record and that mother had convinced her that the two children were in her care at the time of the assessment.  Ms. James had commented to Ms Smith that as an experienced worker she had felt fooled.  Ms. Smith is also concerned that the information which appears to have been provided to the David Lidington MP at  does not appear to be accurate.(B9)

I then heard from mother.  



For the record I should say that Mother read from a statement which she had hand written.  She wanted to be able to read the note out in full.  I allowed her to do so, I have taken note of its contents and it is at C80 and 81 of the bundle.



I should note that after Dr. Adshead had given evidence, Mr. George (Counsel for Mother)  informed me that mother had "remembered" that she had a recording of the interview with Dr. Adshead and that she wished to produce it to show that Dr. Adshead's recollection of this interview was inaccurate.  No party had heard this recording but Mr. George transcribed a part said to be relevant to the issue.  That transcription is now at C75 � 76 of the bundle.  There has been no independent verification that this recording has not been tampered with or in any way doctored.  However, Dr. Adshead was invited to respond to the fact that she had been recorded and what Mother had said about this.  The court received a response which is at C78.  Dr. Adshead expresses her concern that Mother taped the sessions covertly.  She notes,

"I am puzzled that Ms. W did not discuss recording our interview.  This is by no means an unusual request and I am always happy for this to happen; as long as there is then a chance for the recording to be transcribed and agreed later.  It is highly unusual for people I assess to record covertly and suggests a high degree of suspiciousness.  Without an agreed transcript I have no way of knowing whether this is a complete recording or whether relevant material has been deleted."

Dr. Adshead commented that,

"The excerpt provided confirms that we were talking about where Mr. B was living and whether his sons were living with him and what might happen after they were married. "



In a note of a telephone conversation between solicitor for the child and Dr. Adshead which is at C77 of the bundle Dr. Adshead is reported to have commented,

"She didn't understand why it had taken so long to say that there was a recording.  If she'd been asked she would have allowed her to record and they could have agreed a transcript if that was thought to be necessary.  Gwen said that this tends to show the personality disorder in action as it relates to the way that she deals with people with whom she sees she may be in conflict."



Mother produced at court the CV of a woman named AC who Mother put forward  as someone who could assist with the full-time daily care of F and herself .  



Mother was asked her view now of whether she is suffering from a borderline personality disorder.  Mother told me that she found that question difficult to answer because as she put it, her therapist Ms. C has identified that she can be very overcritical of herself and her levels of ability so she tries not to do that.  Mother told me that she is not trouble now by feelings of paranoia and does not experience excessive ups and downs of mood or "quick unthought through reactions."  Mother told me that she believes she is far more able to be rational and to think things through.  She plans to continue to see her therapist whether or not F is returned to her care.



It was put to her that Dr. Adshead thought mother was still negatively emotionally involved with Mr. H but mother denied this saying that if she felt anything at all it was boredom.  She told me the following,

" my only wish is that he would grow up and mature and that his responses would be more adult and less reactive, that he would move away from tit for tat and his aggressive attitude and his wish to use the children as spies in his camp and just get on with life as I have done."  Mother expressed her hurt that in her view he continues to use the children to hurt her.



Asked about the incident with T, mother gave a rather detailed explanation of how I should view the word "snap."  She told me that she was describing her "inner patience", not an outward explosion towards the child.  She then told me what had happened in her view and told me that T had spoken to her in "an accusatory" tone of voice.  Mother told me that T behaved like a "turncoat" and told me that she had been distant in a contact and was then overly affectionate when she said goodbye.



Mother told me that T is an intelligent child and pointed out that she (Ms. W) has an IQ of over 130 and that Mr H has an IQ eight points higher than her.  Mother told me that T is being brought up with her father's ethics namely that it is all right to lie as long as you don't get caught.  She described T as being in a "bubble of confusion and anxiety with someone who is very manipulating." 



Mother told me that her feelings now about contact with the children are remorse, regret and mostly a calm resignation that "if I don't give Mr. H what he has wanted all along I'm putting my children at risk."  "He wants me to slit my wrists, to commit suicide � he has adhered to that opinion from day 1."



Mother was asked why she had not informed Dr. Adshead that she was recording their meeting.  She told me that she wanted a record of what was said in order that she could play it to Ms C.  However when asked whether she had in fact done that she told me she had not.  She was clear in her view that she had not told Dr Adshead that Mr. B's children would be coming to live with them .  She took the view that Dr. Adshead had simply misunderstood what she had said due to the pressure of time constraints.



Asked about the assessment by the complex care team in April 2013 mother told me that she thought this was an informal visit for the purposes of assessing her disability due to the fact that she was going to have to be rehoused.  She had been given two months notice and she was very concerned about where she would be moved to.  Mother told me in evidence that she had made it clear that TM would be living with her in the future but she was adamant that she did not say that F was living with her at the time.



Under cross examination mother was asked her views about the break in contact between Mr. B and his children.   Mother told me,

" it is not ideal, in some ways it did anger me - the complete disregard shown by his ex-wife for the children's welfare."



When asked whether given her history Mr. B's ex wife was justified in being confirmed mother said, "yes in some ways as an initial response," but she would have expected her views to have changed over a period of six months."  Mother's view of the difficulty was in my judgement interesting and instructive as she said the following,

" her demands were that she wanted to see the court paperwork about my children, nothing less will satisfy her, she closed the door on every option other than to go head to head in court, she couldn't respect the point that I was not allowed to release information, she had to protect her children and I had to protect mine.  She had a complete disregard for a rational logical explanation and I had to help Mr B find a way of communicating which was not obstructive.  Her way of dealing with this angered me and it made me more determined to support Mr. B, using my knowledge of negotiating with someone with that frame of mind I guided him by doing some of the e-mails in reply, putting forward options and keeping him calm when he was speaking to the boys on the phone."



Mother described Mr. B's ex wife as "aggressive and closed minded."



In evidence mother told me that she thought Mr. B's decision not to have contact was "short sighted."



According to mother she encouraged Mr. B to have contact with his children. 



According to mother she has always been entirely open and honest with Mr B about her past and the court proceedings.



Mother was asked at some length in the witness box about the car accident which left her with such serious injuries.  Suffice to say, mother's evidence can be summarised as follows;

She continues to believe that Mr H paid someone to cause the car accident which caused her such serious injury.

She was nursed by a nurse who is a friend or associate of Mr H, who told her of  H's involvement and who tried to cause her physical harm whilst she was in the hospital.



However mother told me that she does not believe that the police are part of the conspiracy but that their lack of action against Mr H is because they are overworked.



Mother told me that her relationship with T is strained .  She believes that T has been influenced against her by her father.  Mother told me that as T is older and in order to "stay in her father's good books, she has adapted to the role of spy in order for her father to be proud of her."  She told me that her relationship with her children has "always been tainted with negativity" and that as far as Mr. H is concerned he has not allowed her to be part of the children's lives.



When challenged about why she had taped Dr. Adshead and why she had not informed Dr. Adshead that she was being recorded Mother told me,

"She would refuse to do the assessment and then tell the court that I have refused to do the assessment.  I made the recording because I needed to know if there was any specific advice that I needed in respect of my own therapy."



Mother told me that she had only raised the issue of the recording after Dr. Adshead had left court as she explained,

"I was not aware I still had the recording � it took a lot of finding."



Mother was asked why there had not been a detailed family discussion between herself, Mr. Beer and her parents as to what support package they could offer.  Mother told me that she'd had these detailed discussions with her mother on the telephone and, "I can't help Your Honour about why MGF didn't know about these discussions."  Mother told me that it was "easier" to have these discussions with her mother.



Mother told me that her helper in her home, Mr. M has moved on and is no longer being put forward as part of her support package.



Mother told me that in terms of specific support required she considers that she requires therapeutic support for a longer period of time to allow for life changes and to see whether she can regularly utilise her coping skills and mechanisms.



Mother was asked about information she had given to her MP David Lidington.  A letter from him is at B9 of the bundle.  



The letter is from David Lidington to the chief executive of Buckinghamshire County Council.  The first paragraph sets out the facts and he states they were presented to him,

"My constituent Ms. W of [ ] has been to see me about her housing situation.  Ms. W, her [ ] son and her two year old daughter and full time carer live in a house which is owned by Buckinghamshire County Council, but leased to [ ].  The family have lived there since July 2011 when Ms. W was able to leave [ ] hospital where she had been recovering from serious spinal injuries."



Mr. Lidington goes on to set out Mother's concerns about facing eviction and stated,

"I am sure you  will understand that I am very concerned indeed at the prospect of a vulnerable, disabled woman and two dependent children being put out on the street�"

(At the time of writing this letter neither TM nor F resided with Mother.)

Mother denied telling Mr. Lidington erroneous information and said, "I don't know where he got that conversation from."  According to Mother she told the MP that TM was going to live with her and that F was placed for adoption.  



Mother told me that she accepts the diagnosis that she has a personality disorder and said,

"I still need more support than a normal person with complex arrangements � I need people to be clearer with me about what they expect of me. The solicitor on behalf of the child cross examined Mother at some length about her beliefs in respect of the car accident.  Mother told me that she has proof that Mr. H was involved in organising the car accident.  She produced a Facebook which is at C79 of the bundle.  The Facebook page is dated 18th. February 2011.  On that page is an entry,

"Angie Lea can u lend me �12,500 and get me a car???"

Mother believes this is evidence that Mr. H was trying to get money to pay someone to cause the accident.



In evidence Mother told me that a nurse had "told her" that Mr. H was involved.  However, when challenged about this, Mother told me that the nurse had not told her directly but indirectly.  Mother stated that there was a "bank nurse" who was called "Julie" but wanted to be known as "Pam."  She spoke on the telephone near to Mother whilst Mother was in the hospital bed.  Mother heard the nurse say,

"Hi Tony, how are the kids � if she's there I'll talk to her � she went on to say that he should have known better than to tell Angie anything � got her nephew to do something reckless like this � I'm at work tonight � I'll pop round later with a bottle of wine � I'm going to Egypt."



Mother is convinced that this nurse, who she met on one occasion, was talking to a man called Tony who is Mr. H's brother in law.  Mother is convinced that the nurse deliberately spoke near to Mother in bed in order that she could hear what she was saying.



Asked what made mother believe that this telephone call had anything to do with her accident Mother said,

"It was the nurse's persona."



When it was put to her that there was nothing in the conversation that was a direct link to Mr. H let alone her accident Mother said that she knew the nurse was linked to Mr. H,

"It was the fact that she looked at me with such hatred as she walked up the ward.  I knew that look very well."



Later on in her evidence, Mother told me that the Facebook entry is a "coded message" for her.



Mother told me that she could interpret these messages having spent years living with Mr. H and knowing of his "underhand dealings."

When asked whether Mother really believed that what she had pointed to was evidence of Mr. H's involvement she said,

"this is in itself evidence to me � it is not evidence in the normal sense of the word � not in a criminal way."



Mother told me that the "Facebook" page had been printed out by a man called PB who she had been seeing for a year and who she found out also had connections to Mr. H and was an associate of his.  "he had been working in Mr. H's camp."  She went on to say,

"He printed this off to make me convinced he was not in Mr. H's camp and was not a spy with him and consequently I severed all ties."



Asked about the nurse that Mother is convinced was an associate of Mr. H's who had deliberately tried to cause her harm Mother told me,

"She crushed the left side of my chest at the time it had a drain in it."  Mother said that this nurse Julie/Pam, had deliberately chosen to turn her onto her right side which she knew would cause her injury and caused her to slip into unconsciousness.  Mother said that the nurse, "did not like me for whatever reason."  However, despite mother believing that this nurse had deliberately set out to cause her harm and that she was an associate of Mr. H, she did not report this nurse or her actions to anyone.



Mother was asked about the effect on F of a failed assessment or rehabilitation attempt especially the effect of re-introducing her to contact  with her Mother.  Ms. W told me,

"if it doesn't work I'm pretty sure I will soon be forgotten."



Mother is prepared to leave the contact issue with her three other children in abeyance if F is returned to her care until F is settled.  Ms. W told me that she records all of her contacts with her children so, "I have some proof against his [Mr. H's] false allegations."  The maternal grandparents and Mr. B are aware that all contacts are recorded.



Mother makes these recordings on a Dictaphone.  I asked Mother whether she had the dictaphone at court with her on the day she was giving evidence.  She told me that she did.  I asked her to show it to me.  She removed it from her handbag which was in court although she told me she had not been recording the proceedings.  She told me that she had not recorded any  other professional only Dr. Adshead.



In terms of physical ability Mother told me that she can walk around the house, she can walk upstairs as long as she holds onto the right banister and described that given the weakness in her right side she has recovered as someone would who has suffered from a stroke.



Mr. B works in telesales and is out at work between 7.30 � 5pm.



Mother feels she could have F on her own in the house for up to two hours but would require assistance for any longer periods.  She would require someone with her at all times when out of the house with F.



In re-examination M was asked whether she felt she could work with the local authority.  Mother's answer was, "yes and no."  She qualified this by saying,

"I can work with people who are forward focussing � I don't want to be continually questioned and quizzed about the accident � it has no purpose or relevance.  I don't want to discuss the accident with the local authority in the future."



Mother told me that she would keep F out of the "battleground" between her and Mr. H.



I then heard from the social worker Ms. Chambers.



Ms. Chambers has filed three statements all of which I have read and she confirmed the truth of those statements.  She explained the delay in placing F which it serves no purpose to repeat but confirmed that the care pan of the local authority is  that the current foster carers will be approved as prospective adopters subject to the outcome of this application.  The matching panel is due to take place on 26th. February 2014.



Ms. Chambers told me of Mother,

"I absolutely commend her for the progress she has made physically but I still feel there are areas where Ms. W has not moved on � I still find it concerning that she believes Mr. H was the cause of the accident and professionals and nurses were a party to it � I think she has calmed down a lot and she can process things and not get angry and volatile but in her mind she is saying one thing but believes another."



Ms. Chambers is very concerned about the impact on F of the continuing battle between Mother and Mr. H regarding the three other children and believes this would have a negative impact on F.  She is also very concerned by Mr. B's decision not to have contact with his own children out of "principle" and did not consider the consequences for his own children of such a stance.  She said,

"I have concerns that he would not protect F and that he would take Ms. W's view.  I still feel he takes her view � probably more so � he probably feels she doesn't have a disorder."



Ms. Chambers told me that she would recommend a psychological assessment of Mr. B to consider his ability to understand Mother's personality disorder and ability to protect F from Mother's behaviour if required.



Ms. C told me that contact between F and Mother had been stopped because F had begun to be withdrawn after contact and the foster carer believed that F suffered from night terrors when she would wake up screaming connected to the contact.  Usually F had not been reported to have had any difficulty with her sleeping pattern other than these concerns in respect of contact.  Ms. Chambers told me that in her opinion F has a very secure attachment with her foster carers and she is extremely concerned about the effect on F of re-introducing Mother and destabilising this child's very secure placement.



Despite persistent but appropriate cross examination on behalf of Mother, Ms. Chambers told me that she fully understood the benefits to a child of being reunited with her birth family but in this case she considers the risks to F are too high in terms of causing emotional distress and instability to F, the prospects of success are too low for any further assessment to be warranted or any further delay to be caused before deciding on F's permanent placement.



Ms. Chambers accepted that Mother has always spoken to her in a calm and polite manner but commented,

"I've never had to challenge her."  Ms. Chambers is also extremely concerned by what she sees as inaccurate information having been given to the MP and Ms. James.  She was also concerned by Mr. B originally telling her that he had no children.



Ms. Chambers is strongly of the view that F should be adopted by her current carers and that there should be no further delay to this placement.  F is due to start pre-school in September and Ms. Chambers took the view that F needed to start that chapter in her life secure in the knowledge that she was settled in her home.



The last witness I heard from was the Children's Guardian Ms. Crossby who is an extremely experienced social worker and Children's Guardian.  Ms. Crossby was the Guardian in the care and placement order proceedings.



I have read her report with great care.  Ms. Crossby accepts that Ms. W has made changes but does not accept they are sufficient to cross the first stage.  She told me,

" I have noticed some changes in Ms. W � I visited her in early January � she is more open and maintained eye contact in a way she did not do so before and I was able to discuss things with her which previously would have been more difficult.  She has engaged in therapy which is to her very great credit and I have seen changes but what I have not seen are fundamental changes in her beliefs.  



Ms. Crossby remains concerned about Ms. W's continued suspicion of professionals and their involvement in her life.  She told me quite simply,

"I do not believe she has made sufficient changes for her to be able to work co-operatively with professionals for the benefit of F."



Ms. Crossby cited as examples, Mother's continued beliefs in relation to her accident and Mr. H and is very concerned that Mother believes her daughter T is somehow "against her".



Ms. Crossby does not doubt that Mother loves F and her three other children but believes that there is a degree to which Mother requires those relationships to be on her terms because of her borderline personality disorder.



Ms. Crossby, like Ms. Chambers is extremely worried about the effect on F of being re-introduced to Mother at this time.  She believes her emotional security will be destabilised and she is extremely concerned by any further delay for this little girl.



Asked about balancing the risks to F against the benefits of the chance of being placed with her birth mother, Ms. C told me,

"I've thought about this very carefully � I cannot say the risk to F is worth taking balanced against the likelihood of a successful outcome."



Ms. Crossby told me that she sees the start of pre-school as an important step in F's life and she is very concerned that the introductions needed and assessments required to progress Mother's application to revoke the placement order would have a detrimental effect on F at this time.  Ms. Crossby stated,

"I discuss this in my report � it is balancing not just a question of re-introducing F to Mother and Mr. B and TM and a new home � it is a question of going through a lengthy process of assessment which is likely to disrupt F's education, emotional well being and sense of security in her placement when she has been with these carers since she was four days old."



Ms. Crossby accepted that the carers are "robust" and would do their best to minimise any disruption for F during the introduction process but she still could not support any further delay or disruption for F.    In her view F will be "greatly affected" by the assessment process itself.



Ms. Crossby was concerned that the maternal grandparents had not considered in depth what support they could offer



Ms. Crossby was very concerned by what she saw as inaccurate information having been given to various agencies including Ms. James and the MP.  As Ms. Crossby said,

"What possible motive could the MP have for distorting the information in these circumstances."



Under cross examination Ms. Crossby emphasised that in her view Mother has not made sufficient changes in the really important areas of working with professionals, understanding the concerns of the professionals, putting the needs of her children before her own and being able to take advice , not just that with which she agrees but that which she does not.



Perhaps of key importance is Ms. Crossby's view that,

"The children would need to meet Mother's expectations and she could find it difficult to accept the children's development and sense of self � to be who they are, to express their disappointment, what they want � children can be confrontational � it doesn't mean they can do what they want but they need to be given respect that they have their own point of view and are able to express their opinions."



Ms. Crossby stated that Mother's comment that T "feigned affection" was concerning because it "denied the child's reality which fuels T's anger and confusion."  Ms. Crosby felt this was an example of Mother believing she is right and expecting the child to accept that she is right and when she does not criticising the child, "she's turning into her father." 

Ms. Crossby believes that Mother will find it enormously difficult to cope with the every day situation of "a number of people doing things with her child."  Ms. Crossby has grave doubts about the ability of Mother to work with a team of individuals for the foreseeable future including the grandparents, the cleaner, a nanny, Mr. B and social services and she sees this as a key issue.



Ms. Crossby told me that it is clear that Mr. B has accepted Mother's beliefs, he thinks very highly of her and he is not going to challenge her.  Either he really believes Mother's version of events or if he has doubts he is not prepared to voice them and colludes with mother.   Ms. Crossby is very concerned by Mr. Beer's attitude towards contact with his own children and the importance he placed on winning "the battle" rather than on the needs of his children.  Ms. Crossby's view is that Mr. B is a negative factor when assessing Mother's ability to change due to his absolute support and belief in Ms. W.



Ms. Crossby considers the grandfather is similar in his acceptance of Mother's views,  although she ventured to suggest that this was because he simply tried to "keep the peace."



Ms. Crossby considered that the only way properly to assess Mother would be a residential assessment which she considered would be extremely disruptive to F and not a course which she could recommend.  Ms. Crossby when pushed told me that she would put the chances of a successful rehabilitation at no more than 20% and that that was "generous."



Finally Ms. Crossby expressed a concern that Mother can be "an extremely engaging person" with a "tremendous spirit" and people can "feel for her" and want to get it "right for her."  Ms. Crossby is very concerned that the complex package of support that would be needed may address and focus on Mother's needs and F's needs would be overlooked.



After what I anticipated would be the close of evidence Mother asked that she be re-called to answer the comment made by Ms. Crossby that Mother would not accept a child's development or "sense of self."  Reluctantly I acceded to this request.  Mother then proceeded to describe situations when she was with Mr. H about how she had protected her children from Mr. H's parenting.  In my judgment she missed the point (to an extent) that Ms. Crossby had made and  continued her stance of describing in detail how concerned she is about her children being in Mr. H's care and what a destructive and frankly malign individual he is.  She tried to tell me how she had sought to protect T from Mr. H but did not address the issue of her ability to understand that the child may have a different point of view as a separate individual which she would have to accommodate.



I have set out above this summary of the evidence in some detail in order to show the depth and breadth of the forensic exercise at this the permission stage.  Given the difficulty of the case at the care proceedings stage and the fact that this application was possible due to F's non placement, I was determined that Mother had every opportunity to put her case as fully as possible, particularly in the light of the psychiatric evidence that Mother has improved mental health.  



At the end of the hearing at submission stage I specifically asked Mr. George to take instructions from Ms W to confirm that she is satisfied that all the evidence that she requires to be put before the court has been adduced and to ask if there is anything else she would wish to be said.  Mother confirmed through her Counsel that there was no such further evidence.  It therefore came as something of a surprise when on 14th. February 2014 I received through the court office a further four page document from Ms. W asking that it be placed in the bundle.  I sent this document to all the parties and extended the time for sending out the draft judgment from 17th. to 18th. February 2014 to allow any party wishing to make further representations to do so.  No party sought to make any further representations.  I have put this document at C82 � 85 of the bundle.  I will refer to it in due course.



The Law.



Turning to the law in relation to this application.  I am grateful to Mr. George of Counsel who has submitted written submissions on behalf of Mother.  I have used those submissions as a basis for directing myself on the relevant statute and case law but have obviously made significant amendments to those submissions.



I must have regard to section 24 Adoption and Children Act 2002 namely;

S24(1)(3) Adoption and Children Act 2002 [FCP-2013-308];

24 Revoking placement orders

(1) The court may revoke a placement order on the application of any person.

(2) But an application may not be made by a person other than the child or the local

Authority authorised by the order to place the child for adoption unless �

(a) the court has given leave to apply, and

(b) the child is not placed for adoption by the authority.

(3) The court cannot give leave under subsection (2)(a) unless satisfied that there has

been a change in circumstances since the order was made.

(4) If the court determines, on an application for an adoption order, not to make the

order, it may revoke any placement order in respect of the child.

(5) Where �	

(a) an application for the revocation of a placement order has been made and has

not been disposed of, and

(b) the child is not placed for adoption by the authority,

the child may not without the court's leave be placed for adoption under the order.

Mr. George has referred me to the following case law;



Case Law

1.	Re P (a Child) (Adoption order.  Leave to oppose making of adoption order)  [2007] 2 FLR 1069

2.	Warwickshire County Council v M and L [2007] EWCA 1084 [2008] 1 FLR 1093.

3.	Re SH-NS-H v Kingston Upon Hull CC [2008] EWCA Civ 493 

4.	Re B-S (Children)(Adoption: Leave to oppose) [2013] 2 FCR 481

5.	LRP (A child) (Care Proceedings: Placement Order [2013] EWHC 3974 (Fam)

6.	Re B Care Proceedings: Appeal) [2013] UKSC 33

7.	Re W (adoption order: leave to oppose); 3H adoption order: application for permission for leave to oppose) [2013] EWCA Civ 1177.

8.	Re AW [2013] EWHC 2967



I remind myself of M v Warwickshire County Council [2007] EWCA Civ 1084.



"On establishment of a change in circumstances, a discretion arose to grant leave to apply for revocation of a placement order under section 24(3) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in which, while the welfare of the chid was not paramount, the welfare of the child and the prospect of success should both be weighed.  In conducting the discretionary exercise under section 24(3) courts might usefully, in the vast majority of applications, borrow the language of the test generally applicable to permission to appeal in civil proceedings and as to whether the applicant would have a "real prospect of success would almost always include the requisite analysis of the welfare of the child, but the analysis of the welfare would not always be satisfactorily subsumed within an analysis of prospect."



Mr. George submits the following,

"The provisions of S 24 are analogous to S 47 and provide for a not dissimilar remedy.  The guidance and extensive review of the law by the Court of Appeal in re B-S is pertinent to applications under S.24 (3) as well as S 47(5)."



I respectfully agree with Mr. George who has referred me to the case of Re AW   when the distinction between the two was commented upon by Pauffley J.

"Ms Fottrell also contended that an application for leave to revoke the placement order and an application for leave to oppose the adoption are analogous. In order to succeed in relation to the former, and at a time before the child had been placed for adoption, a parent would have to demonstrate there had been a change of circumstances since the order was made. The court would then go on to consider whether or not to exercise its discretion and also whether the application has a real prospect of success (Re F (a Child) EWCA Civ 439). 

In relation to the latter, an application for leave to oppose the adoption, a parent would have to satisfy the court there has been a change of circumstances which is relevant or material to the question of whether or not leave should be granted. The change in circumstances must be of an nature and degree sufficient on the facts of the particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion; and the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child throughout her life ( Re P (Adoption: Leave Provision) [2007] 2FLR 1069 ). "

I therefore consider the test required for the leave application.

The Application for leave involves a two stage process (see re B-S para 72 and 51 approving Re P).  This is a matter of judicial evaluation not mere discretion. 

"In our judgment, analysis of the statutory language in ss 1 and 47 of the 2002 Act leads to the conclusion that an application for leave to defend adoption proceedings under s 47(5) of the 2002 Act involves a two-stage process. First of all, the court has to be satisfied, on the facts of the case, that there has been a change in circumstances within s 47(7). If there has been no change in circumstances, that is the end of the matter, and the application fails. If, however, there has been a change in circumstances within s 47(7) then the door to the exercise of a judicial discretionevaluation to permit the parents to defend the adoption proceedings is opened, and the decision whether or not to grant leave is governed by s 1 of the 2002 Act. In other words, 'the paramount consideration of the court must be the child's welfare throughout his life'."



I use the term evaluation rather than discretion as that is what the Court of appeal urge me do to at paragraph 72 of their judgment.



Therefore the key distinction between the two applications is that the child's welfare is not the paramount consideration of the Court when considering s24 [See Warwickshire cc v M and L at [21/22] but F's welfare must inform the court's evaluation.



On behalf of Mother Mr. George submits,

"Whilst the welfare of the child is not paramount for an application under this section it is trite law that the welfare of the child is a very significant consideration and in this context it is the consideration throughout F's life."



Turning therefore to the "change of circumstances, what must Mother show? 



 The "change in circumstances" does not need to be significant  Re P at [29/30]  but needs to be of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given."



I remind myself of paragraph 68 of Re B S namely,

"We share McFarlane LJ's misgivings about Thorpe LJ's use of the phrase "exceptionally rare circumstances" as also about his use followed by the President in Re C [2-13] All ER (D) 235 (Apr) , of the word "Stringent" to define or describe the test to be applied on an application under section 47(5).  Both phrases are apt to mislead, with potentially serious adverse consequences.  In the light of Re B they convey quite the wrong message.  Neither in our judgment, any longer has any place in this context.  Their use in relation to section 47(5) should cease."



The test should not be set too high; Terms such as "Exceptionally rare circumstances" per Thorpe LJ re C or "stringent" "are phrases apt to mislead"

The test should not be set too high to prevent parents from bettering themselves [See Re P at [32]]

The test should not be set so as to discourage parents from preventing their child being adopted [See Re P at [32]];

I must bear in mind that when considering the "prospects of success" the question is not whether the child will be returned to the potential applicants care but of revoking the placement order. [NS-H v Kingston at [22]].  



Of note, it is conceded on behalf of Mother that whilst this case is referred to Mr. George submitted,

"Whilst good law on the facts of this case there seem to be only two outcomes for F.  Adoption or placement with her mother."



I have also considered the entirety of Re BS.  Whilst I am considering an application to revoke a Placement Order, I remind myself of what that order means for this child.  If it is not revoked F can be placed for adoption which is the most draconian of orders.  In particular I remind myself of paragraph 22 of Re BS namely,

"The language in Re B is striking.  Different words and phrases are used but the message is clear.  Orders contemplating non consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are a "very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do." Where no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interest", they are "the most extreme option" , a last resort when all else fails" to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short where nothing else will do."

I have also specifically considered paragraphs 32 � 34 of LRP (A child) (Care Proceedings:Placement Order.) per Pauffley J.



"The legal principles of application when the court is confronted with applications of this kind are well known,  Where possible, consistent with their welfare needs, children deserve an upbringing within their natural families (Re KD [1988] AC 806; Re W [1993] 2 FLR 625).  Care plans for adoption are "very extreme" only to be made when "necessary" for the protection of the children's interests, which means "nothing else will do," "when all else fails".  Adoption "should only be contemplated as a last resort" (Re B [2013] UKSC 33; Re P (a child) EWCA Civ 963; Re g (a child) EWCA Civ 965.)

Before I could consider placing LRP elsewhere than with her parents, or one of them, I must be sure there is no practical way of the authorities or other agencies providing the requisite assistance and support which would allow her to be cared for by at least one of their parents (Re B-S (Children) [2013] Civ 1146.)

I must analyse and consider all of the realistically available competing options and I must weigh in the associated positive and negative factors.  I have to be satisfied there is a sufficiency of evidence in relation to each proposal so as to undertake a global, holistic and multi-faceted evaluation of LRP's welfare."



Before considering placing F elsewhere other than with one or both of her parents, the court has to be sure there was no practical way of the authorities or other agencies providing the assistance which would allow her to be cared for by at least one of her parents see Re LRP.



Analysis and discussion.



Therefore the first issue I must address is whether there has been a change of circumstances of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given.



The factors relied upon by mother to argue that there has been such a change in circumstances are as follows;

1.	Improvement in Ms. W's mental health

2.	Improvement in Ms. W's physical abilities.

3.	The suitability of Ms. W's accommodation.

4.	Ms. W's relationship with Mr. B

5.	Ms. W's support network including her improved relationship with her parents.

6.	The fact that TM now resides with her.

7.	At the time of her application Ms. W relied upon the fact hat she has regular contact with her children.  This is no longer the case.



The key factor in this list is whether and to what degree Mother's mental health has improved.  This is central to this case because one of the key reasons for making the care and placement orders was that I took the view that Mother would not be able to co-operate with the complex and long term package of support that would be required for her to be able to care for F due to her physical disabilities.  It was not the provision of such a package that was the issue.  It was Mother's ability to work with many different professionals in the long term for the benefit of Freya.  

When first looking at the written evidence of Ms. C and Dr. Adshead there seemed to be evidence of sufficient change in Mother's psychological functioning.  I had accepted in the care proceedings that Mother has a treatable borderline personality disorder as diagnosed by Dr. Adshead.  There is no dispute that Mother has undergone therapy with Ms. C (the details of which I have set out above in the evidence section), which Dr. Adshead considers to have been "appropriate."  Ms. C told me that in her professional opinion Mother has made marked improvements in the way she can consider and react to daily life challenges.  On the face of it, there is a reasonable argument that Mother would meet the first stage of the test.



However, as I heard the evidence, in particular from Ms. W herself, I became increasingly concerned that on key issues Mother has made either no or insufficient improvement or progress.



I was looking for Mother's ability to consider that there can be issues and problems in life which may be of her own making and for which she must take responsibility and for her ability to consider the views of others when they disagree with her.  Both of these issues are important in considering whether Mother would be able to co-operate with a team of professionals and carers for the benefit of F.

Whilst Ms. W objects to the focus on her car accident and her theory of the cause of it, in my judgment it remains relevant.  Ms. W to this day cannot accept that this dreadful accident, which caused her such physical injury, could have been due to any negligence on her part.  She remains steadfast in her belief that she was the victim of a murderous conspiracy orchestrated by Mr. H.  Whilst I accept I have not heard from Mr. H and I have not conducted satellite litigation to consider the causes of the accident, (and I have not experienced Mr. H as Mother has) the evidence upon which Mother relies to justify her beliefs is frankly bizarre, incredible and does not bear scrutiny.  Mother cannot explain how Mr. H could have hired a person to get into a car with another individual (who may or may not have known of the plan)  in order that they deliberately smash into Ms. W with the express motive of killing her.  Mother in my judgment can produce no evidence that begins to prove that theory.  At one point Mother told me that  nurse (Pam/Julie) had "told her" of Mr. H's involvement.  In fact, when the questioned about this it is clear the nurse had done no such thing.  The totality of the evidence against the nurse was that she had looked at Mother, "with hatred in her eyes" and Mother had overheard a conversation between the nurse and another individual who mother had assumed knew Mr. H.  Mother also gave an account of this nurse deliberately trying to harm her in hospital by turning her onto her right side (as opposed to her left) and yet Mother made no such complaint against the nurse.



Mother cannot consider that she may be mistaken about this.  Her settled view is that she is the victim in all of this and yet despite this adversity has battled on.  None of this is her "fault".  She understands the conspiracy and despite explaining it, others do not believe her.  This simply adds to the injustice that she suffers.  All of this remains Mother's settled view and contrary to Ms. C's opinion, Mother does not seem to have progressed in this view at all.



I was very concerned by what has been described as "dishonesty" by the local authority in the information provided by Mother to various professional agencies.  I place no weight on the example of the DVLA because it seems to me that Mother may have given accurate information immediately after her discharge from hospital.  However, I am concerned about the information Mother is said to have given Ms. James and to the MP which I have set out above.  Mr. George made careful submissions about the weight that could be attached to this evidence.  He reminded me that I have not heard from Ms. James or the MP.  I do not know whether contemporaneous notes were made and how the documents before the court came into existence.  Whilst I have taken account of all of these very well made submissions, it seems to me incredible that both individuals "misunderstood" Mother to such a degree.  Whilst I have not heard from Ms. James, I heard from Ms. Smith who had spoken to Ms. James and specifically confirmed that the account given by Mother in the assessment was accurately recorded.  She felt that Mother had not been honest with her.  Similarly I find it incredible that the MP would have misunderstood so comprehensively the information Mother had given him.  For him to be concerned that TM and F would be "out on the street" when neither were living with Mother suggests to me that Mother had not been honest with them.  Mr. George asks me to accept that even if I take the view that it is more probable than not that mother gave inaccurate information to these professionals, and I do,  I should effectively give myself the "Lucas" direction.  These interviews were conducted at a time when mother was due to be evicted from her home and she was very concerned about being re-housed.  Mr. George asks me to consider that Mother may have put a particular gloss on her family situation in order to secure housing and that a general concern about her inability to work with professionals cannot be drawn from this.  Firstly, that is not mother's case.  These are not admitted lies.  Once again Mother's case is that she is the victim of others misunderstanding her.  She is blameless.  Secondly, if she did give inaccurate information it suggests a degree of manipulation of professionals which is a concern that I have with this mother.  For a package of support to work in order that Mother can care for F, Mother must be able to work in a straight forward, transparent and honest way.  This example raises real concerns in this area.



I was concerned by the late document submitted by mother, without permission, on 14th. February, but which I have accepted into evidence and have considered.  In that document Mother has a heading, "The issue of me not being child focused."  Mother commences that paragraph with the following sentence, "I do not feel that this issue was explored fully within the hearing."  I have to say I found this a disappointing submission.  In my judgment Mother was given every opportunity to put her case.  The oral evidence lasted over three days and Mother was in the witness box for over a day.  She was able to give very full (at times rambling) answers without interruption.  This seems to be yet another example of Mother believing that if her case is not accepted it is because of yet another injustice done to her namely that there was some flaw in the process, rather than because of the merits of the case and the legal tests I must apply.  In my judgment, Mother's ability to be child focused was the central issue in the case and great care was taken by all concerned, not least her able advocate, to ensure this issue was before the court.  



I was concerned by Mother's behaviour in respect of taping Dr. Adshead.  Firstly Mother should not have taped Dr. Adshead without her consent and permission.  Had she asked Dr. Adshead, permission would have been given.  I  find it incredible that Mother had "forgotten" that she had a tape of Dr. Adshead's interview whilst she was giving evidence and that it had emerged only after Dr. Adshead was released from the court.  That put Dr. Adshead in a very difficult position which she should not have been put in.  The recording, even on her own evidence, does not evidence Mother's account.  Mother's justification for making the recording is that she wanted to play it to Ms. C to discuss her therapeutic and treatment needs and yet Mother has not played this recording to Ms. C and frankly could give no credible reason why not.  I am concerned that Mother had the recording equipment at court.  I can place little weight on Mother's denial that it has not been used to tape court proceedings.  She should not have brought it into court.  I am concerned that Mother considers it appropriate to tape all of her contacts with her children.  I respectfully agree with Ms. Crossby that it tends to show that mother views all contacts as part of an ongoing battle with Mr. H rather than as simply enjoying contact with the children.



This degree of suspiciousness concerns me greatly.  In my judgment it is evidence of Mother's difficulty in functioning without believing that others will misinterpret her and that she requires "proof" of what is said in many different situations. 



 Ms. C told me of the improvements in Mother's ability to consider the viewpoints of others.  There is no doubt that Mother has successfully constructed a life around her which is supportive and more positive than before.  However, when I consider Mother's life, she is surrounded by individuals who support her view of the world and her situation.



Mother's relationship with Mr. B is clearly a change for Mother and has contributed to her feeling of well being and happiness.  The evidence before me is that these two individuals are committed to each other and will be married in May 2014.  I have no doubt that Mr. B loves and cares for Mother and is genuinely committed to her at the present time.  However, my concern about this relationship is that Mr. B's devotion to Mother compromises his ability to consider important matters dispassionately and he finds it very difficult to take a view contrary to Ms. W.  There is no clearer example of this than the issue of contact with his own children.  It seems to me entirely reasonable that Mr. B's ex wife (I shall refer to her a Mrs. B) raised concerns about the suitability of Ms. W having contact with her two boys once she had learnt that Ms. W's 5 children had been removed from her care.  Frankly, had Mrs. B not raised such concerns one would have had to question her own child protection abilities.  Mr. B should have been open with Mrs. B about this from early on in his relationship with Ms. W and certainly once Mrs. B had learnt of this, understood and tried to assuage her concerns.  Whilst Ms. W tried to portray herself as a reasonable mediator and negotiator in this scenario, it was clear from her evidence that she was dictating or at least assisting Mr. B in drafting e mails to Mrs. B.  Ms. W's evidence in respect of Mrs. B was concerning, seeing her as a deeply unreasonable person.  I note Mother's description of Mrs. B in the transcript produced by mother (at C75),

"well� it was very similar to mine in that his ex-wife is very much controlling and manipulative unfortunately shows a lot of characteristics the same as Mr.H."

In fact Mrs. B had allowed generous and unrestricted contact between Mr. B and the boys up until she knew of Ms. W's past.  However, Ms. W sought to paint the difficulty as lying squarely with Mrs. B.



I respectfully agree with Ms. Crossby that there is a worrying resonance between the way Mother has conducted her "battle" with Mr. H and the way Mr. B has conducted himself with Mrs. B.  I was extremely concerned that Mr. B did not have contact with his own children "out of principle" due to Mrs. B's concerns about Ms. W.  If this was really Mr. B's independent decision, it is extremely concerning.  He clearly prioritised his relationship with and the feelings for Ms. W above the needs of his own children.  I find it hard to think of a less child centred response to his own son than to tell him that he cannot see them because their mother does not like Ms. W.



Mr. B aligned himself to the sensibilities of Ms. W and took his son into the centre of  what I can only describe as the "battle" between Ms. W, Mr. B with Mrs. B.  Mr. B should have continued to put his sons first.  He should have maintained direct contact whilst working with Mrs. B to assuage her concerns.  Whatever the influence was of Ms. W in this situation, if positive as she would ask me to believe, it was ineffectual.  However, given her own evidence of involvement, it appears to have been entirely unhelpful and counter productive.  I do not accept that Ms. W tried to assist Mr. B in seeing the problem from Mrs. B's point of view (which was understandable) and encouraging a child centred solution.



If Mr. B cannot put the needs of his own sons above his relationship with Ms. W I have no confidence that he will put the needs of F above those of Ms. W should a situation arise when he is concerned about Ms. W's behaviour or mental health.  



I was also struck by Mr. B's complete acceptance of Mother's case that Mr. H had caused her accident.  There seemed to be no doubt in his mind that Mother's account is credible and true despite such a belief (on the evidence Mother has told me) simply not bearing scrutiny.



I am concerned that Mr. B does not understand the gravity of Mother's condition and her associated problems.  Whilst I believe him to be a well meaning individual, he struck me as almost naive and accepted so much of what Mother tells him at face value including the reasons why the three children were originally removed from Mother's care.  I do not find that Mr. B is a negative factor per se.  In many ways he is a positive factor for Mother as an individual in her own right and clearly gives her emotional and physical support.  However, I do not view him as a positive or protective factor for F.  I have seen no evidence that Mr. B would disagree with Ms. W and quite the reverse, he will support her to the detriment of himself and his own children.  Mr. B is a not a factor which assists Mother in meeting stage 1 of the permission two stage test.  Nor is Mr. B evidence that Mother has progressed in having better relationships with those around her.  Mr. B has become mother's main supporter and champion and is entirely aligned to her view of the world and the challenges they both face.  Her rigidity of view is supported and not challenged or in any way threatened by Mr. B.



Similarly Mother places weight on her improved relationship with her own mother.  In my previous judgment, I set out in detail my concerns about Mother's own view of her mother, namely that she suffered from a severe personality disorder.  Mother has never accepted that any conflict in that relationship was due to any unreasonable behaviour on her own part.  Mother has told me that her relationship with her mother has improved and certainly PGF told me that there was less tension at Christmas when Mother went to stay with her parents.  I did not hear from the MGM and therefore do not know her views on these matters.  However, in my judgment it is interesting to note that one of the main areas of tension between Mother and MGM has resolved namely TM has returned to Mother's care.  I am also unclear exactly how much contact Mother has with her parents and certainly I was concerned that given the importance of this hearing, there had not been a family meeting to discuss the practical support the grandparents would be able to give.  I was unconvinced by Mother's evidence that she has had extensive discussions with her mother on the telephone which her father seemed unaware of.  Firstly, if true it raises concerns about the communication between the grandparents but it seems unlikely that MGF would have come to court without having had those discussions with his wife.  (This was not put to MGF.) Moreover, it is unlikely that Mother would not have had those discussions with he father who historically she has always been closer to, even if I were to accept this improved relationship with MGM.



I was very concerned about Mother's attitude towards contact with her own children.  Contact has broken down and again Mother finds it very difficult to accept that this is in any part due to her own behaviour.  I respectfully agree with the social work evidence that the relationship between Mother and T is concerning.  Her description of T as "feigning affection" suggests that Mother is attributing rather sophisticated and adult motives to T when she is a child caught up in a very difficult situation between two parents.  Mother lacks an ability to accept that the difficult relationship between her and the three children could be due (at least in part) to her own parenting or behaviour towards the children.  Again, it is the fault of Mr. H.  The difficulties between her and T are because "T is becoming like her father."  Despite her therapy, Ms. W could not refrain from making an inappropriate comment to T about Mr. H which T reported back to her father and contact has since been suspended.  Conflict resolution on this issue has not improved at all since the care proceedings.



I respectfully agree with the submissions made on behalf of F through Mr. Trueman as follows,

"The Guardian does not see the right sort of change in Ms W's mental health, whether in nature or degree, to give her any confidence at all in Ms W being able to function any differently regarding her children's welfare. There is no movement in realisation of harm to a child caught in the fall out of such vehement dispute between Ms W and Mr H. So, although the therapist may say there has been change and progress in the therapeutic setting, there is no evidence of improvement in Ms W's ability to prioritise the needs of her children over her beliefs and her dispute with Mr H. She will go on recording contact and meetings with professionals, she continues to lie about events and background facts and she now has her camp believing in what she says, because she gives a consistent account of the car accident for example, to Mr B.

Both Mr B and Ms W put the principle of them being right before the need to maintain good regular contact with their respective children. Ms W could have resumed contact with her children (as could MGPs) if a payment of �250 had been made to Mr H. It is wrong for Mr H to withhold contact but a pragmatic approach, which would best serve the children's needs, would be to pay the money and get contact going again. Mr B did not see his children for some months due to their mother Mrs. B, being unhappy about a lack of information about his new partner who had had 5 children removed from her care. It was reasonable for Mrs. B to say that the new partner should not be present, until she knew more, or Mr B should have contact in the absence of Ms W. Neither Mr B nor Ms W put their children's needs above their own."



I accept the opinion of Dr. Adshead that Mother has made some improvements but that she still has some way to go.  I also accept that Mother can present as calm and less rigid in situations where she feels supported and not threatened but that she may present very differently when under stress.  I am very concerned about the risk of relapse for mother if put under stress and accept that attempting to care for a defiant three year old may be such a trigger.



Turning to Mother's accommodation,  whilst I accept Mother has suitable accommodation for F to return to her care, this was not the reason for F not being returned to Mother and does not constitute a change.  It is not a relevant change for the purposes of this test.



Therefore for these reasons I do not accept that Mother has made sufficient change in the key areas needed.  Whilst I accept that she has undergone therapy and she is leading a more positive and a happier life, her ability to take responsibility for any problems in her life and to accept a different viewpoint from her own does not seem to have progressed, if at all, to a sufficient degree.



Therefore I do not consider that there have been sufficient changes to Mother's mental health to constitute a change to satisfy the first stage of the permission test.  I therefore do not find that there has been a change of circumstances of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given.



However, if I am wrong about that I have considered the prospects for success under the second stage of the test.



In my judgment within the care proceedings I wrote the following,

"The key issue for the court therefore is whether there is any package of support available which will protect F from the risk of emotional harm and from physical harm and neglect if placed in Mother's care.

Having read all the evidence in the bundles and heard the oral evidence of the witnesses as detailed above, I am of the view that there is no package of support available which will safeguard Fs emotional and physical well being whilst remaining in Mother's care.

I do not accept that Mother can meet F's emotional and physical needs on a consistent basis in the long term and I am satisfied that the risk of emotional harm and physical harm and neglect is unacceptably high.  I accept that Mother would not deliberately cause F physical harm but her inability rationally to accept advice on practical issues would put F at risk.  If Mother stopped co-operating with professionals and withdrew from professional help F would be at risk of neglect.  I am particularly concerned about F's emotional well being when Mother became distressed, anxious or angry.  Mother's behaviour during contact with her other three children showed that she can react angrily and with complete disregard for her children when her emotions overwhelm her.  That happened within the restricted environment of supervised contact with MGF supervising, a man for whom Mother has great affection and who is very sympathetic towards her.  The risks to F are much higher with Mother as a full time carer.  I find these risks cannot be managed within the birth family."



In my judgment this remains the key issue.  Given that I am not satisfied that there has been sufficient change in Mother's ability to co-operate with professionals for all the reasons I have given, my judgment about this key issue remains the same.  Mother's personality disorder would "get in the way" of mother's ability to co-operate.  

For all the reasons set out above I do not accept that Mother has made sufficient change in the key area of being able to co-operate with professionals who may have to put forward a different view to her own and focus on F's needs rather than her needs.  I accept Ms. Crossby's concerns that the package of support may tend to focus on Mother's needs rather than on F's.



I rely on the evidence of Dr. Adshead that even in the areas of improvement, there remains a risk of relapse which although is hard to quantify, is real and may be triggered by the stress of caring for F.  In my judgment this risk is too high given the very severe problems mother has encountered in the past and the harm that F would suffer as a result of a failed rehabilitation attempt or indeed by an intensive period of assessment which ultimately proved unsuccessful.



Even if I am wrong about that, in order to test out whether Mother's ability to co-operate has significantly improved, all parties are agreed that if permission to apply to revoke the placement order were granted there would then need to be a long period of assessment.  Although there has not been a recent detailed assessment of what practical support would be needed of Mother's ability to care for F, it is accepted on behalf of Mother that there would have to be a comprehensive package of support to assist Mother due to her physical difficulties.  Mother has put forward a package of support including her parents, Mr. B, her cleaner and a nanny/helper.  Clearly there would also have to be a high degree of local authority monitoring (certainly at the beginning) given the concerns of the past.  This assessment would need to involve F and in fact the children's Guardian is of the view that only a residential assessment would provide the sufficient degree of monitoring and assessment required properly to consider Mother's ability to care for F.  Ms. Crossby is strongly opposed to any such assessment or any disruption to F's life at this stage.



I must consider the welfare arguments at this second stage as part of the assessment of "prospects of success."



The Children's Guardian asks me to consider the following factors and argues that if appropriate weight is placed on them, I will be driven to find that welfare considerations will render any prospects of success unrealistic.  



a.	F has been in the care of her prospective adopters since a few days after she was born.

b.	Those carers are ready to adopt her now.

c.	To uproot her from those carers would be potentially harmful, especially with poor prospects of successful placement elsewhere.

d.	F has a pressing need for permanency now and has already waited 3 years for this opportunity.

e.	Ms W has not shown an improvement in her understanding of the needs of children. 

f.	Mother has not moved on in her preoccupation with Mr H. That preoccupation blocks her focus on her children's welfare.

g.	Mother has recorded professionals' meetings and contact with her children thereby showing a highly suspicious aspect to her thinking and not one which has a child welfare focus. She is intent on the "battle" and will do what she needs to win it.

h.	Mother has told different stories to different professionals to secure what she wants. This is not a good omen for a sound or positive working relationship with professionals.

i.	Mother has an unrealistic view of the care of F and no clear plan for how this would work, who would contribute what and when. 

j.	No real thought has been given to how to deal with a 3 year old child who may not want to do as Mother says. Mother's response to children who do not do her bidding is not child centred. Her comment that T "feigns affection" for her, comes to mind, as does her refusal to pay what the Father says amounts to arrears of maintenance which leads to a 6 month gap in contact and Mr B's refusal to have contact without Ms W present.

k.	Mother says that she expects that she and F would have to make adjustments. F is 3, and unlikely to be of a mind to make adjustments.

l.	F's reaction to contact with mother was negative- it is said she had night terrors, linked to her contact. In other words, that the night terrors occurred during the time she was having contact with her mother but when contact stopped, so did the night terrors. The Guardian believes it would be harmful to reintroduce F to her mother.

m.	Mother's contact with her children who live with their Father is difficult and to bring F into this troubled contact arena would put her at risk of emotional harm.

n.	The only way to test if Mother could look after F would be to try it out. That experiment would likely to lead to emotional harm to F who would likely be distressed and confused as to what was happening. She has not seen Ms W since April 2013 when the goodbye visit took place. She would not have positive memories in light of the night terrors surrounding contact. It is submitted that such an experiment would be potentially abusive.

o.	There is no one who can stop Ms W saying inappropriate things to F. Mr B does not challenge her and he is the only person who would be there, when he is not at work and were he prepared to challenge her.

p.	Limited weight should be given to the evidence of the therapist, with a realisation that she gave a therapist's view; positive but perhaps only half the story. What she says is not reflected in Mother's suspicious actions in lying to professionals, recording professionals and her children. Dr Adshead said these are indicative of the personality disorder in action. The therapist has to be positive but her focus is Ms W and should be taken as such.

q.	F will not be equipped to deal with a Mother who scans people for criticism. Her mother will not be equipped to deal with the criticism and rejection a young child can present.



In my judgment these points are well made.  Key to those points is that save for the first four days, F has been in care all her life.  She has been the subject of litigation for most of her life.  Her future has therefore always been uncertain.  Happily, F's experience of care is of one settled placement with carers to whom she has become securely attached.  She has not had contact with Ms. W since April 2013.  For mother to succeed at this stage, F would remain the subject of litigation for at least a further 6 months and would also be part of ongoing assessments, the resolution of which is likely to require at least one further contested final hearing.  I accept the process of assessment is likely to unsettle and disrupt F's emotional security.  I cannot countenance this disruption, when I have assessed the prospects of success to be so low.  In my judgment, such an assessment would cause F emotional harm and distress.  She is fortunate that her current carers have been assessed as being appropriate to adopt her and therefore if this application is refused, subject to the matching panel, there is no uncertainty about her future placement.  However, I wish to make clear that my judgment in this matter would not have been different if F would have to move on to a different adoptive placement and her current carers were not putting themselves forward.  



In my judgment it is not in F's welfare further to delay a permanent placement with her current carers given the inordinate delay she has already suffered through these proceedings and challenges to orders already made.  Throughout my deliberations, I have kept in the forefront of my mind the draconian nature of adoption, (and I bear in mind the guidance set out above) and that the result for F if the placement order is not revoked is a plan of adoption.  At every stage I must consider whether adoption is the only realistic option.  It is important to note that Mother's case has been argued on the basis that there are only two options available at this stage namely, rehabilitation to Mother or adoption.  It has not been argued by Mother or any other party, that there is any other family member who can now care, or that I should at this stage consider long term fostering with direct contact between F and Mother.  Although this has not been argued, in accordance with Re B-S I have considered whether there are any other realistic options to adoption in the light of my findings in respect of Mother.



The current foster carers have put themselves forward as adopters.  They are therefore willing to care for F for the rest of her minority and beyond although I do not know what their view would be about caring for F as long term foster carers.  I have considered whether long term foster care would be in F's best interests.  I have already emphasised the point that F has been in care all her life thus far.  Only an adoption order will give her the permanence and stability that the local authority and Children's Guardian argue F requires.  I respectfully agree.  It cannot be in F's best interests to consider revoking the Placement Order to leave her as a "looked after child" for the rest of her minority.  Furthermore, it is clear that Mother will never accept any other carer for F.  She believes her place is with her.  In my judgment there would be a real risk of harm to F of being subjected to further litigation throughout her minority if she does not have the permanence of an adoption order either through repeated applications to revoke the care order or through applications for contact.  In my judgment direct contact between F and Mother would bring with it the risks of emotional harm through F being caught up in the conflict between Mother and the local authority.  I also bear in mind the evidence of the local authority that contact between F and Mother was stopped due to the foster carer reporting F suffering form "night terrors" associated with contact.   In my judgment the risks of F's placement  and emotional stability to such an arrangement are unacceptably high.  Therefore, although not specifically asked to do so, I have considered whether there are any other realistic options to adoption in this matter.  Sadly, in my judgment, there are not.



Therefore , in my judgment  adoption is the only option available to F at this stage given all of the circumstances of this case.  In my judgment this interference in F and Ms. W's family life is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the risks to F if Mother's application is acceded to and litigation continues.



For all of the reasons set out above I do not grant Ms. W permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order.  I do not find the first stage of the test for permission is satisfied but even if I am wrong about that, in my judgment the prospects of Ms. W succeeding in her application to revoke the placement order are so low that it is not in F's welfare for there to be any further assessment or any further delay in her placement being secured.  Therefore Mother's application for permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order is refused.



I come to this decision with a heavy heart.  I like so many others, commend Mother for the improvements she has made to her life.  Her physical rehabilitation is little short of remarkable and she has been committed to therapy.  I hope that she will continue with her therapy as she has told me that she will, whatever the outcome of the case and that if she and Mr. B marry in May I hope they will find happiness in the long term.  



I wish to thank and commend all of the advocates for their enormous assistance in this case.  In particular I wish to thank Mr. George for the great care and sensitivity with which he has represented Ms. W, for which he has the court's appreciation.

JUDGE SCARRATT:



The local authority applies for care orders and placement orders in respect of KK, born on 5th January 2012, and KH, born on 25th January 2013.  KK therefore is aged just two years and KH just one year.  They are currently in foster care and have been there since April 2013, almost one year, awaiting the outcome of these proceedings.  The boys' mother is Miss K, "the mother", and the maternal grandparents are Mr and Mrs H, "the grandparents".  Both grandparents are disabled and are confined in the main to wheelchairs.  Mrs H suffered a stroke and can only walk very short distances with the aid of a stick; her hearing is severely impaired.  Mr H suffered from polio from an early age and in 1998 was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.  He cannot walk or, as reported to the social worker in her original viability assessment, hold things.  The boys' fathers have not engaged in these proceedings and have played no part in these proceedings nor in my deliberations.  The two fathers have not engaged in any meaningful way with the local authority within these proceedings.  Mr K disengaged in December 2012 or thereabouts and no longer attends the supervised contact with KK or indeed court hearings.  All attempts by the local authority to engage him have failed.  Despite the efforts of the local authority to locate and engage Mr J, KH's father, he did not wish to be made a part of these proceedings, nor engage with the local authority in their work.  The mother does not now seek the return of the children to her care.  She supports the application of the grandparents (her parents) to care for both boys.  The children are represented by a guardian, Miss Perrin.  She supports the local authority's applications for care and placement orders.  This has not always been the case as in her report, dated 13th September 2013, she supported then a further assessment of the grandparents.  The final report of the guardian dated 28th March 2014 does not support rehabilitation of the children to their mother's care or placement of the children with the grandparents.  She recommends that both boys are placed for adoption.  

 



I have heard oral evidence and submissions over the best part of three days: oral evidence from Miss Dixon, an adult social worker, Miss Lent, the social worker in this case, the mother and the grandparents, as well as from Mr Simmonds, the independent social worker and the author of the assessment of the grandparents, and the guardian.  I have read the court bundle.  In reaching my decisions I have taken into account all of the evidence before the court, both oral and written.  If I do not mention parts of the evidence in this judgment it is not because I have ignored it or forgotten it, it is simply that other parts of the evidence are in my judgment more relevant and informative.  

 



The case is not straightforward and I have taken a few days to consider the issues prior to giving this judgment.  I have, though, managed to give this concise judgment within one week of hearing submissions on the basis that I appreciate how important it is for the parties, especially the grandparents, to know the outcome as soon as possible.

 



I will deal the background facts very shortly, taken from the neutral outline from the local authority.  The family has been known to the local authority since February 2012 following a referral received from the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in respect of KK.  KK was admitted to hospital with an injury to his left arm.  He was six weeks old at the time.  An x-ray was taken and showed that he had suffered a fracture to the wrist.  There was said to be a small bruise to the right side of his forehead.  On 16th March 2012 Dr Stephen Chapman, the consultant paediatric radiologist at the Birmingham Children's Hospital, concluded that the injuries sustained were either caused non-accidentally or were injuries which the parents wished to conceal.  The mother was noted to have suffered postnatal depression following KK's birth.  The cause for KK's injury could not be explained by either parent and as a result he was placed in local authority care pursuant to section 20 of the Children Act 1989.  KK remained in a foster placement until 18th May 2012 when he was returned to the care of his mother as she had moved to live with her parents, Mr and Mrs H.  This decision was made after a child protection conference held in May 2012.  During this time at the maternal grandparents' home it is right to record that there were concerns in respect of the mother's care of KK.  Following KH's birth in January 2013 the mother and the children moved to hostel accommodation.  Observations were made by the social worker that the mother's mood was low and she expressed a lack of connection towards KH.  At the mother's request KH went to live with his grandparents for a week or so.  The mother's anti-depressant dosage was increased and the mother began to re-engage with mental health services.  However, upon KH's return to the mother's care, Social Services reported the downturn in her parenting of both children, for example she was neglecting the care of the property in which the children lived as well as neglecting the needs of the children.  KK was already the subject of a child protection plan from May 2012 under the category of physical abuse due to sustaining the fracture I have already mentioned.  KH was added to this plan in August 2012.  At the conference in 20th February 2013 an additional category of neglect was added to that plan.  The local authority issued an application for interim care orders in respect of the children on 16th April 2013.  They were uncontested at the first appointment in April 2013.  The matter was transferred by the Justices to this court on the grounds of complexity.  The guardian supported the local authority's applications.  At the allocation hearing on 24th April 2013 it was directed that viability assessments be carried out in respect of the grandparents, a maternal aunt and uncle and a family friend.  The court also directed a psychiatric assessment of the mother be carried out by Dr Judith Freedman together with a parenting assessment.  The parenting assessment ruled out the prospect of rehabilitation of the children to the mother's care.  It concluded that she had an understanding of a child's needs and what is expected of a parent to meet those needs but that she did not have the ability to apply and act upon this knowledge, despite the high level of support provided to her.  It is, I sat at this stage, to the mother's credit that she has reached the very difficult decision, no doubt considering this assessment and all of the evidence, that she is not in the position to care for her two sons.  I commend her for this decision, which cannot have been easy for her to make.  She now, of course, supports her parents in their application to care for the boys in their home.  The viability assessment of the maternal grandparents concluded that they were not viable options as long-term carers for the children.  I will come to further assessments later in this judgment.  The maternal aunt and uncle did not continue to put themselves forward as prospective carers and there was a negative assessment of the family friend.  

 



Dr Freedman conducted a psychiatric assessment of the mother and concluded that she suffers from chronic depression and anxiety.  This and her personality disturbance is longstanding.  Dr Freedman opined that if she decides to make use of her medication and to seek psychotherapy it is likely that her symptoms would decrease in intensity.  The most likely form of relapse would be a worsening of her depression and/or anxiety and this would impact negatively on her ability to parent.  Her prognosis for achieving lasting change in the next one to two years, the doctor opined, with combined treatment and medication and psychotherapy is good.  It is based on her deciding that she needs help, which when the report was written she had not yet done.  In respect of how the mother's condition affects her ability to care for her children, Dr Freedman concludes that it is likely that the combination of disturbed personality traits and chronic depression and anxiety has affected her ability to maintain stability in her relationship with the children.  At times the mother becomes preoccupied with anxious doubts and self-blaming beliefs, such as that she is not doing enough for the children.  When she is in this state of mind she does not function to her full potential as a parent.  Her condition causes her to be confused, do what is good and bad for her and for the children, her judgment about others is impaired and this affects her ability to protect herself and her children.

 



The grandparents sought a further assessment by an independent social worker, Miss Parry.  I allowed this application on the basis that all avenues needed to be explored when the local authority was seeking to place both boys for adoption outside of the birth family.  It was supported by the guardian.  So despite the negative viability assessment by the social worker, Miss Lent, it was determined that the court would be assisted by a more detailed assessment in respect of the maternal grandparents.  Miss Parry in her report dated 28th October 2013 concludes that despite the fact they are loving grandparents they lack the necessary insight and ability to deal with the emotional difficulties that their own daughter, the mother, experienced whilst growing up and continues to experience.  Miss Parry was concerned that they would not have the capacity to meet the emotional needs of the children as they grow up.  There was also concern raised in respect of the grandparents' support network and in respect of their own physical capacity to cope with their grandchildren, given their own physical difficulties and reliance upon outside care.  At the final hearing, which was originally listed to commence in December 2013, I determined that there were still gaps in the evidence insofar as the viability of the grandparents was concerned.  I did not consider at that stage that the court could in fact reach a fully considered decision as to the final placement of the children.  Miss Parry's evidence was, in my view, based on really quite minimal contact with the grandparents and I was keen to ensure that the court had all the available information, as well as ensuring that the grandparents felt they had been treated fairly.  I allowed the grandparents, therefore, the instruction of a further independent social worker, Mr Terence Simmonds, to undertake a further assessment of the grandparents.  This would be their third assessment within these proceedings.  This was a difficult decision bearing in mind the length of time the boys had been in foster care at that stage but it was essential, in my judgment, to do justice to all of the parties including the children having regard to the draconian nature of the orders sought.  That report dated 24th January 2014 concludes that although there are some positives in respect of their care of the children, overall the grandparents currently lack the capacity to fully manage the specific emotional needs of the children to a good enough standard.  The report is careful to deal with the abilities of the grandparents separately and reflects on whether either of them is able to compensate for any deficits in the other's parenting.  Concerns are raised in the report about the grandparents' ability to implement effective boundaries and to be able to offer a sensitive parenting style that will be responsive to the children's needs, both now and in the future.  An intensive parenting programme is recommended if the children are to be returned eventually to the grandparents' care.  The report sets out too positives observed by Mr Simmonds.  I shall return to this assessment and Mr Simmonds' oral evidence later in this judgment.  

 



So the position is, at this final hearing, that the grandparents continue to seek the placement of both boys with them and challenge the  (three) viability assessments of the social worker, Miss Lent, Miss Parry and Mr Simmonds.  Neither the social worker, nor Miss Parry recommended that the children should be placed with them and Mr Simmonds concludes that the grandparents' parenting styles do not meet the needs of the children at this time.  

 



I note the agreed threshold document dated 18th April 2013.  I am satisfied on the evidence that the threshold criteria are indeed met on the evidence before the court.  That being the case, the issue, a stark issue indeed, is whether or not the boys should reside permanently with their grandparents, their mother agreeing that she is unable to parent them herself, or remain in care and be placed for adoption.  No one else puts themselves forward for an alternate and viable option.  That therefore is the issue for the court to decide.  I am concerned with the welfare of each child.  Their welfare is paramount. I am bound to decide this case on that principle.  I have the Welfare Checklist at section 1(3) of the Children Act 1989 in mind as well as the paramountcy principle enshrined in section 1 of that Act.  

 



Because the care plans are for non-consensual adoption I pay special regard to a number of recent cases and decisions and the principles enunciated therein.  In Re B (A child) [2013] UKSC 33 it was made clear that where non-consensual adoption is contemplated, the court should approve a care plan for adoption where nothing else will do, where no other course is possible in the child's interest. In addition, the court must be mindful of and consider the Article 8 rights of the parties and must make a decision that is proportionate in all the circumstances.  In Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965 it was directed that the court should not take a linear approach to ruling the parents out; there must be a:

 

"Global holistic evaluation and a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weight its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared side by side against the competing option or options."



In Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 the same points were made again and analysed by the Court of Appeal.  The case reiterates the need for, "Proper analysis, argument, assessment and reasoning."  It also requires consideration to be given to the provision of assistance and support, which would allow a child to be placed with its parents or, in this case, the grandparents.  In Re LRP (A Child: Care Proceedings Placement Order) [2013] EWHC 3974 Fam further directions were given as to how Re B-S should be approached and applied.  Consideration must be given to:

"All of the realistically available competing options. The realistic as opposed to the fanciful options.  It is worth reiterating that the focus should be upon the sensible and practical possibilities rather than every potential outcome, however far-fetched."



It emphasised again that adoption was a last resort and that all realistic competing options should be looked at and assessed.  Furthermore and eloquently the court discussed the nature and benefits of adoption if no other realistic option was found to be available on the facts of a particular case.

"The advantages of a placement order are many and obvious.  Prospective adopters are required to submit themselves to a rigorous and very thorough assessment process over many months.  Those who satisfy the selection criteria are ordinarily of the highest calibre.  They may be confident they expect to provide extremely good parenting to any child who is matched with him in all areas of his/her development.  The overwhelming probability is that they will be able to provide her/him with the priceless gift of a happy, secure and stable childhood from which he/she will derive lifelong advantages."



This case law and the principles set out therein are at the forefront of my mind when considering the competing claims in this matter.  All parties have addressed me on the law in final submissions and I have looked at all the authorities presented to the court.  The oral evidence was heard over a day and a half.  It is not necessary, in my judgment, to set out the oral evidence in detail.  I intend to refer to salient and relevant parts only.  Miss Dixon, the adult social worker for the grandparents, had not seen the grandparents' care of either of the children but she confirmed that adult and children Social Services were quite separate entities within the local authority and that her adult department would not provide services to meet the needs of the children if the boys were placed with the grandparents; that would be a matter for Children Social Services.  She could not assist how the grandparents would cope with the boys if they lived full-time with them as she had not seen them caring for them and she accepted that it was the grandmother herself who had told her that she would be able to cope if the boys were so placed.  She, Miss Dixon, accepted that she infact had no first hand knowledge of the grandparents' parenting skills.

 



Miss Lent, the social worker, conducted the negative assessment of the grandparents.  She was concerned that if the grandparents were to undertake an intensive parenting course prior to the children being placed with them, a suggestion of Mr Simmonds, that such a course would be outside the timescales of the children.  I heard details of such a course at the Maudsley from Miss Lent, which if undertaken would not be fully undertaken before the end of 2014.  Another such course, run by Iris in Brighton, was discussed in court and details have been obtained.  If commenced in mid April a report can be made available in mid June.  If the grandparents engage well, further work would almost certainly be necessary.  Again, Miss Lent thought this to be outside the children's timescales, especially if there was to be ongoing work beyond June 2014 and the information received suggests that that would be the case if progress had been made by the grandparents, although some consideration might be given to placing the children with them whilst the ongoing work took place, although it would have to be "very carefully considered," the director of Iris suggests in her information supplied to the court by email.  Miss Lent gave credit to the grandparents for the recorded instances in the chronology when KK was seen happy and contented in his grandmother's care and that there appeared to be some attachment on his part.  She agreed partially that the grandparents could in fact meet the boys' physical needs.  Mr Simmonds opines that they can.  She herself had reservations about this and pointed to the fact that she had observed the grandmother doing most of the practical parenting and taking responsibility.  She accepted that their assistance from Adult Social Services would continue whatever but that if help was required from Children's Social Services it would have to be assessed as and when required.  Miss Lent confirmed that the mother had been compliant with the local authority during its involvement in the case, especially the fact that the mother had not disrupted placement for the children and had engaged with services, including the assessment offer.  Miss Lent in answer to questions from the guardian considered, when balancing risk, that the risk was too great to the boys if they were left in the grandparents' care as things stood and even taking account of a parenting course because the end result was an unknown and that that risk was greater than that resulting from their removal from their birth family.  

 



The mother was emotional when giving her evidence and I can understand this, taking account of her decision not to seek the return of the children to herself.  She told the court of a happy childhood, as she saw it, but accepted that she went "off the rails" (her own words) when she was a teenager, a difficult teenager, she told me.  She was bullied at school and felt that she couldn't tell her parents about this, agreeing that it would have been easier if she could have spoken to her mother about the bullying.  When she was living with KK and her parents they shared the care of KK equally, she said.  She thought her mother might struggle once the children became bigger.  Mother confirmed that she felt supported by her parents when she lived at home, although she was taken to Dr Freedman's report in cross-examination which detailed her terrible ordeals during her early to mid teenage years: depression, the victim of bullying, a sexual assault at 16 by a stranger and a rape at 18 by another stranger as well as self-harming and violent relationships with controlling men, A and then Mr K.  She admitted to Dr Freedman that she was, "drunk most of the time from 15 to 18," and took drugs from age 16 to 21.  She told the court with reference to these ordeals she suffered during her teenage years and the fact that it did not appear that her parents had in fact been supportive that she thought her parents could learn from these mistakes, as she put it, and that they would not make such mistakes again.  

 



Mr Simmonds opined that the grandmother has the potential to be able to parent both children.  He was concerned about her parenting style.  It needed to be significantly warmed up, as he put it, especially in relation to KK, who has avoidant attachment difficulties.  He would not place either of the children with her until she had undergone an intensive parenting course such as the one run by Iris in Brighton.  Such an intervention, he said, was necessary, indeed essential, if the children were to be placed with the grandmother.  As for the grandfather, he opined that his particular parenting style was not in fact going to change ever within any reasonable timescale and certainly not within the boys' timescale.  He described the grandmother as brittle and irritable and quickly aroused by irritation.  As the children grow older he thought this would be increasingly frustrating for them if they were living together.  He pointed to the perpetual air of tension in their household and the problems that that may cause.  Although not always damaging to the children, when coupled with highly critical parenting further difficulties would arise and impact upon the children, especially as these children require a high degree of nurturing and warmth, especially KK who has withdrawn into himself and requires positive intervention by his carers.  Mr Simmonds was positive about his second observation of contact.  The first observed contact was a disaster by all accounts and described as such by the grandparents.  He concludes that the grandparents could cope physically with the care of the boys.  His concerns, he told me, were emotional.  It was possible, he said, if the grandmother underwent a course such as Iris in Brighton that she may be able to parent the children at some point in the future, pointing out that she had only ever cared for KK in any event.  He would be looking for evidence that she could sustain and maintain change to her parenting style.  He was optimistic of initial success if the grandmother underwent such a course, that was his experience in other cases, he told the court, but sustaining improvement was more problematical.  Mr Simmonds thought observations of KK being a happy child with the grandmother not correct.  He did not see this happy, bubbly personality now that was described in the social work chronology.  He thought the positive observations of KK with the grandparents in the chronology just did not fit with their parenting style, which he had observed intently.  He concluded that the best chance of KK being loved unconditionally was by him being placed with the grandmother if that was at all possible � but only after a successful intervention programme with evidence of clear and sustained change by her.  

 



Mrs H gave evidence and told the court that if she was able to undertake a parenting course she would be able to deal with her grandchildren emotionally, as she put it.  She told me how she and her husband were always there for their daughter during her terrible teenage years but she acknowledged that perhaps she had got it wrong, something she appreciated when she commenced the Incredible Years learning programme a few weeks ago in February.  She described realisation of her own shortcomings as a parent as recent and described how she now listened more and what she had learnt in the two sessions of the Incredible Years programme she had attended thus far and she gave me various good examples in the witness box.  Mrs H in cross-examination said that she would do what is required of her to have her grandsons live with her although she did not think she had in fact done anything wrong.  To the guardian she said that she did struggle to understand the local authority's concerns and she acknowledged that perhaps they had got things wrong as far as Miss K was concerned, for example, that they had not shown her sufficient love and that it could be because she was lacking in warmth.  She accepted that she may require some assistance with shopping if the boys were to live with her and in the park, playing, as they got older.  

 



Mr H saw his role as a joint carer and he considered KK to have regressed since being placed in foster care.  Nevertheless, he was prepared to undertake an intensive parenting course too and attempt to change his parenting style, notwithstanding Mr Simmonds' view that this parenting style could not be changed within the boys' timescales.  He wanted to do this, as did the grandmother, ie the intensive parenting course, because they both love the boys and both wish the boys to remain within the family.  

 



The guardian did not alter her views as set out in her various reports when giving oral evidence.  She maintained that the risk to these very young children was extremely high because of the parenting styles of the grandparents, as observed by the local authority and two independent social workers, as well as by herself.  She commented upon the grandparents' documented poor working relationship with the local authority and her fear that the grandparents would not be able to sustain benefits learnt in any parenting course (however intensive), as well as the brittle nature of the grandmother's character and her irritability generally; all these factors, she opined, would impact considerably on the children's emotional and physical stability.  She wanted to see a high level of parenting skills by the grandparents now.  Learning was not sufficient.  There had to be an automatic response triggered by an event.  That was absent.  She used the example of Mrs H feeding too hot food to one of the boys without checking the temperature of the food.  She considered that the grandmother did not really understand or see why she should go on an intensive parenting course.  She was just going to do it because she had been asked.  Some contact that she had observed had been good and she acknowledged the grandparents' love for the children and their entirely proper motives for opposing the applications before the court.  In short, the guardian considered the risks too great for the children to wait to see whether their grandparents could sustain and maintain change, following, for example, the Iris, Brighton course or similar intensive parenting course.  She told the court that she had undertaken a proper analysis in respect of the risks for the children if adopted and if not adopted and returned to their birth family.  She accepted that there was no analysis of the boys' relationship with their grandparents but pointed to the clear evidence in the chronology of the various observations of contact.  She accepted, too, that there was no specific evidence of the children being unhappy with their grandparents.  She was keen to hear the grandparents' oral evidence in any event before she gave her evidence and finalised her views.  That she had done.  

 



I commence my consideration of the evidence on one basis, namely that the children should be placed with their own family if at all possible.  I have already referred to the law in a little detail and of course I remind myself that placing children outside of their birth family is a last resort.  It is accepted by the local authority and the guardian, indeed everyone, that both children are very much loved by their mother and by their grandparents and no doubt their wider family.  The local authority and guardian submit that the positive advantages of the placement of the children with the grandparents are outweighed by the risks.  They point particularly to the evidence of Mr Simmonds, whose overall conclusion was that although he identified some positives in respect of the grandparents' care of the children, overall they lack the capacity currently to manage fully their specific emotional needs and this applied especially to KK.  He suggested intensive parenting programmes such as Iris, Brighton.  Mr Simmonds stresses the need for the grandparents to maintain and sustain any changes they make through such a course.  The local authority and guardian both submit that for the grandparents to successfully undergo such a programme and prove that they could maintain a sustained change would be outside of the children's timeframes, they having already been in care for almost one year.  They rely on Mr Simmonds' evidence in particular that the children could not be placed with the grandparents now and that they would not be able to provide good enough parenting due to their inappropriate parenting styles, not being able to meet the boys' individual needs, especially KK, and Mrs H's lack of warmth, her brittleness and irritability.  Certainly Mr Simmonds stressed the first contact session he observed when he witnessed a lack of basic parenting; the grandmother admitted to being irritated and distracted and no doubt she was nervous.  She herself described that contact session as a disaster.  The grandparents' ability to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the boys is questioned by the guardian particularly and Mr Simmonds noted how they coped rather better with one child when KH attended only the second part of one contact session.  He told the court that when the grandmother's positive parenting of one child went up, her parenting of the other child went down.  The local authority questions whether the grandparents could properly parent KK with his particular needs when exercised with parenting the younger KH.  The grandfather, he opines, cannot change his style and the local authority submit that he was unable to articulate what support he would be able to provide other than, for example, "love and making them laugh."  The arguments against placing the children with the grandparents are supported, the local authority and guardian submit, by the grandmother's responses in her oral evidence; the fact that she did not really feel that she needed to change her parenting in any substantial or fundamental way, that there was room for improvements and that they have had difficulties working with professionals, who they consider to be critical of their ways.  I pause to say that the grandparents' difficulties in working with professionals is manifest in certain of the emails that have been sent to the court for my attention by them following the close of the evidence.    

 



The local authority and guardian both submit too that the court has to take account of the way the mother was parented by her parents, these grandparents.  The grandmother accepts that initially she was not there for her daughter during the crucial teenage years, when, as described by the mother, she came off the rails.  She then appeared to have a change of heart, denying that she knew that Samantha had been bullied at school, was having inappropriate sexual relations at 16 and on suicide watch at age 17.  The local authority relies particularly on the mother's evidence that she felt she could not confide in her mother at that age and that generally the grandmother has little or no insight into her daughter's difficulties during these important and formative years or indeed into her own dysfunctional parenting, as the local authority describes it.  

 



The grandparents assert their good emotional care of KK when he lived with them and rely on the references in the chronology and papers generally to his attachment to them; for example, he is described as developing his own identity and having a bubbly personality.  The grandfather asserts that KK's development has deteriorated since he left their care, for example in his speech.  Asked the question whether they are able to parent the boys, they assert and the evidence tends to support their assertion, that they are able to parent them physically with assistance, as now, from Adult Social Services.  Mr Simmonds does not rule them out as parents on the basis of their physical disability on the basis that they are entitled to assistance from Adult Social Services and if the children were living with them some form of assistance may be forthcoming from Children's Social Services as well.  The social worker was rather more circumspect in her evidence, having observed the grandmother doing most of the practical care when KK lived with them.  She considered that there were (in fact) some difficulties with their physical care and this might increase as these two very young boys became older and more demanding, a view (indeed, a concern) expressed by the guardian.  As I say, accepting Mr Simmonds' evidence, the grandparents with all their disabilities and lack of mobility are not ruled out as potential carers on the basis they would be unable to physically care for their grandchildren.  The grandparents in submissions also assert that the local authority is able to provide support and should do so and if there is a very good chance that such support would bring about a pivotal improvement, adoption is not a proportionate response.  The guardian and the local authority are criticised for not providing adequate analyses in relation to adoption, notwithstanding several reports from the guardian and three assessments of the grandparents.  In my judgment this criticism ignores the proper analysis of placement options and the effects of such on the family and the children found in the social worker's most recent statement dated February 2014 and in the final care plans for each child.  I read that evidence together with the evidence in the Guardian's several reports and in the three assessments of the grandparents.  It was essential too for the court to hear the grandparents' oral evidence when the level of insight into their own needs in terms of parenting and in terms of the concerns of the local authority could indeed be assessed.  

 



As far as mother's very considerable difficulties as a teenager are concerned, the grandparents rely on Dr Freedman's diagnosis of mother's significant difficulties of her own at that time.  It is said that she was not neglected by her parents and that the local authority and the guardian are making too much of this aspect of the case.  

 



I have paid especial attention to the details of the Iris, Brighton intensive parenting course.  I set out some important features of it here, the provider having been sent essential papers in this case prior to a response which I sought during the course of this hearing.  I now quote a few paragraphs from an email received from Iris by all parties following submissions:

 

"Both Mr and Mrs H demonstrated in their changed scores between Mr Simmonds' first and second observations that they were able to make changes.  It is difficult for me to ascertain that the first observation was unusually bad or whether they were able to utilise advice and guidance to increase their scores so significantly in the second session.  If the latter, this offers hope that they would be able to use the model to increase their child-centred interaction and develop a warmer tune relationship with the children.  The model is behavioural but time and again we have observed that when parents or carers start to act on the instruction and guidance given and see the difference this makes to the child and the way the child responds to them they begin to feel differently themselves and differently towards the child.  This can set in motion a positive cycle, which leads to an internalising of the skills sought so that they are not just doing them but believing and feeling differently so that their interactions with the children are also different but become part of them rather than something they do.  The model uses high degrees of praise to encourage and therefore Mr and Mrs H may engage better than they have with some of the professionals as they would feel less criticised.  Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee of change.  Indeed Mr Simmonds considers it unlikely that Mr H will achieve the necessary change.  



As stated earlier, from the reports seen both Mr and Mrs H are starting from a very low level and in the dysfunctional range of parenting it is extremely unlikely that change of the type I have discussed above could be effected in the six sessions that I have given a cost estimate for.  We could undertake an assessment of Mr and Mrs H as outlined in my earlier email.  We could start in early mid April subject to a suitable venue being identified and complete within eight to ten weeks to file a report in early June.  This report would be able to demonstrate how Mr and Mrs H were working with the model, if they can remember and utilise skills and changes from one session to the next and whether they are able to build and increase their child centred responses and decrease their child directed behaviours.  It would also be possible to begin to see whether they value these changes and therefore might start to internalise them.  Conversely, it would also identify if they were unable to make use of the model or if the pace of change would be too slow to be realistic in regard to the children being placed in their care.  At this stage it would therefore be possible to identify if further work is needed or not.  Even if they engage well it is very likely that further ongoing work would be necessary beyond this to be used as an intervention for therapeutic change rather than a brief assessment tool.  



If it was decided to place KK and KH with Mr and Mrs H it might be possible for this to happy alongside the more therapeutic way, so they need not be in foster care until it was fully completed.  The timing of this will need to be very carefully considered.  There would need to be a degree of professional confidence that Mr and Mrs H had made sufficient progress that there would be no slippage if the children lived with them as this would be extremely detrimental to both KK and KH.  It might be several months or longer before such confidence could be expressed and it is not possible to be definitive about a timeframe at this juncture."



That is from the email from Iris Brighton.



I am struck by the fact that it is "very likely" that further ongoing work will be necessary, even if the grandparents engage well because they start at a very low level of dysfunction in respect of parenting skills, as described in the email.  This chimes with Mr Simmonds' evidence of their lack of parenting skills currently and the fact that they must maintain and sustain that which they have learnt following such a course.  It is in fact not possible to say when or if the children could be placed with the grandparents, if further work following the initial ten weeks was proposed.  It all depends on the engagement of the grandparents and whether any change for the better can be sustained and maintained.  The risk to these children in these circumstances and in my judgment is manifest.  They have been in foster care for almost 12 months; KH for almost all his life and KK for just under half his life.  I have to balance very carefully the risk to them of remaining in foster care awaiting the outcome of any parenting course and any follow up in the event that the grandparents engaged well (an indeterminable length of time at this stage) against the risk to these boys of placing them now permanently outside of their birth family.  I accept on the evidence that with some support the grandparents are able to physically care for these children, notwithstanding the grandparents' very serious disabilities, although as the children grow and their needs change it may well be that they will require more assistance and day-to-day care.  It is their emotional care which the court is most concerned with, the day-to-day emotional care of two very young boys, one of whom, KK, is in a state of emotional withdrawal/avoidant attachment, as diagnosed in the paediatric assessment which I have looked at.  I note the reported incidences of KK being content in the care of his grandparents and some attachment, as well as incidences of emotional warmth on the part of the grandmother.  These are, I find, at odds with the observations of Mr Simmonds in particular.  His response was that he had conducted an in depth assessment of the grandparents and he had reached a different conclusion. He had no information as to the expertise of the reporting officer in respect of those incidences, he emphasised.  I am sure that there were incidences of some emotional warmth between grandmother and the boys but I note Mr Simmonds' expert assessment that the grandmother fundamentally lacks emotional warmth - she needs warming up emotionally, as he put it - and also the fact that Mr Simmonds emphasised several times that these children need a high level of nurturing and warmth and that these grandparents cannot provide that without undergoing an intensive parenting course, the outcome (and length) of which is unknown.  I accept and prefer the evidence of Mr Simmonds.

 



Mrs H came over whilst giving her oral evidence just as described by Mr Simmonds and the social worker - as brittle and irritated; I take account of the fact that she was nervous and upset whilst giving her evidence and was having problems with her hearing aid.  I regret to say this as she clearly loves the children and wants the best for each of them.  She struggled, in my judgment, to see what the concerns were about her daughter's parenting of the children and of note, in my judgment, she did not appear to think that she, herself, really needed to change her parenting style in any fundamental way.  There was, I regret to say again, an element of lip service when she accepted in evidence the need for an intensive parenting course.  Of equal if not of more significance was her attitude to her own parenting of her daughter and the terrible ordeals she, the mother, endured during her teenage years.  I ask myself rhetorically - where were the parents when Miss K was being bullied at school, sexually abused by strangers, including a rape, and in an abusive relationship all between the ages of 16 and 19 leaving aside the question of the daughter's (admitted) addiction to drink and drugs or so it seems during those years?  I fully accept that the mother has problems of her own, identified by Dr Freedman, but I find the fact that the mother felt that she could not confide in her own mother in respect of, for example, the bullying at school very troubling indeed.  

 



I find on the evidence that the grandmother and the grandfather too both lack insight into their own daughter's difficulties and, importantly, into their own dysfunctional parenting of their daughter, the dysfunctional parenting identified by Dr Simmonds in his report.  The local authority and guardian's submission that history is a good indicator of future care is, in my judgment, supported by the evidence in this case.  It is of very great concern to the court when dealing with the welfare of these two very young children.  Both boys but especially KK have suffered the emotional setbacks as described by the guardian during their short lives.  Before they can be cared for by the grandparents the grandparents have to:

 

(1) 	engage successfully in an intensive parenting course of indeterminate length,

(2) 	maintain and sustain that which they learn, and

(3) 	the developmental setbacks and attachment difficulties would need to be addressed in respect of both boys, as opined by Mr Simmonds in his report.

Meanwhile, the boys would remain in foster care until their grandparents are ready to commence parenting.  Mrs H may have the potential to care for the children with the support of her husband and Mr Simmonds may well be correct when he said in evidence that the best chance for KK to be loved unconditionally is by his grandmother but in my judgment and having read the details of the parenting course envisaged it is all, in fact, too uncertain.  I am not convinced at all that such an intensive parenting course would be successful, having seen and heard the grandmother give evidence and taking account of the body of evidence surrounding the history of the grandparents' parenting of their daughter, nor that the grandmother in particular would be able to maintain and sustain any change in her parenting style.  I have had the very real benefit of hearing her in the witness box and I regret to say that there was manifestly a lack of insight into how she parented her own daughter and how she had to change if there was to be any chance of her parenting her grandchildren.  Her recent enrolment with the Incredible Years programme may well assist her with some skills and I hope it does but it is too little too late for these boys.  I have also had the benefit of three independent assessments, none of them positive and all critical of parenting style.  

I am very conscious that removal from the birth family is an option of last resort.  I am very conscious of my duty to look at all the options globally; that I have done.  Contrary to criticism of the guardian and local authority by the grandparents, I find they have done too.  I am not at all persuaded the children's welfare will be promoted by having them wait even longer than they have already to see whether their grandmother can change her parenting style sufficiently so they can be safely and effectively parented.  There is, in my judgment, much evidence to suggest that such change will take a long time a coming, if at all.  I have already dealt with my grave concerns as to the parenting of their own daughter and my finding that history in this case is a good indicator of future care.  My task is to evaluate all the options, as it was said in Re BS, undertaking a global, holistic and multifaceted evaluation of the child's welfare which takes into account all the negatives and the positives, all the pros and cons of each option.  I have performed a balancing exercise.  I have compared the option of the children remaining within the family with the grandparents with the only other option, which is permanent placement outside the family by means of adoption.  The timescales for change by the grandparents, especially the grandmother, I find are wholly outside the timescales of these two very young children (leaving aside how these grandparents might cope physically with these boys as they become older and more demanding).  They require security and nurturing in a permanent placement as soon as possible.  This will deal to some extent with their development setbacks, a matter that cannot be left.  The information from Iris, Brighton only confirms my view that even if the grandparents engage by the middle of June, many months would elapse before a judgment call could be made in respect of their sustaining and maintaining improvements and whether these children could be moved safely into their care.  The simple fact is that at present the grandparents are unable to provide warm, nurturing and suitable parenting for the ever-changing needs of the children during their minority to a good enough standard.  That is, I find, the evidence in this case.  



I prefer the evidence of the professionals in this case to that of the grandparents where it conflicts.  There is no evidence before the court that, on the balance of probabilities, it can conclude that there is at least a good chance that they, the grandparents, will be able to achieve and more importantly sustain and maintain the necessary changes needed in their parenting styles in order to afford these particular children the care they need and all (importantly) within the children's timescales.  The children have been in foster care since April 2013, a fact I have repeated more than once in this judgment because it is, in my judgment, so very important.  Further delay to a decision being taken in respect of their permanence in my judgment can only have a detrimental effect on their emotional wellbeing (having due regard as to how they present now) and I have regard to all the details of a protracted intensive parenting course in reaching that conclusion.  The children require stability and permanency.  The timescale for achieving that is already overdue, in my view.  They cannot wait in the hope, for that is what it is, that at some time in the future their grandparents might be able to change their parenting style to accommodate the children's very clear emotional needs.  In my judgment, the prognosis for the grandparents being able to achieve sustainable change is poor at best and not at all within the children's timescales.  

 



I am satisfied that the professionals in this case and indeed the court have conducted a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated and compared.  The mother commendably has appreciated that she is unable to care for the children.  No other family members or friends are available.  I have been concerned in the main in this case at looking at the grandparents' case, the positives and negatives, as against removing the children from the family.  There are no gaps in the evidence; Mr Simmonds' report is more than comprehensive and although the guardian accepted some criticism from the grandparents' counsel, her reporting of various analyses, taking all of her reports together, is for want of a better expression, Re BS compliant.  The realistic, competing and available options are placement with the grandparents or placement outside the family.  In my judgment, these children with all their attendant difficulties cannot wait for the grandparents to prove that they can parent and nurture them properly with emotional warmth and importantly sustain the same.  Whilst the disadvantage of making a placement order is that the children will be deprived of being brought up within their birth family, in my judgment this is in fact the only realistic option for them which will promote their welfare.  Placement orders will provide them with almost immediate security and permanence, which can only promote their welfare not just during their minorities but also throughout their lives.  I have the Adoption Welfare Checklist as set out in the Adoption Act well in mind.  For all these reasons, threshold not being in dispute and which I find proved in any event, I will make care orders and placement orders in respect of each of these children.  I approve the care plans for adoption and I dispense with the consent of the mother in respect of the placement application, the children's welfare requiring me so to do.  

 



I appreciate how upset the grandparents will be with this decision, as will be their mother.  They all love these children very much and only want what is best for them.  I hope that when the dust settles, if it ever does, that they might be able to appreciate that the court's decisions are in the best interests of each of these children and are made with one objective: to promote their welfare, as paramount as it is, throughout their lives.  I very much hope that they are able to meet with any prospective adopters in due course, if that is their wish.  This is the judgment of the court.

HIS HONOUR JUDGE GARETH JONES:

I have before me applications for Care Orders and Placement Orders in the case of two sibling children, JaKD born on [a date in]  July 2010, three and a half years of age; and MJD born on [a date in] December 2012, and therefore fourteen months of age.

 

The Applicant Local Authority is Flintshire County Council represented by Mr Sellars.  The mother Mrs LD is represented by Miss Guirguis; the father Mr GJ is represented by Mr Corbett-Jones, and both parents are in Court today.  The Guardian is Jane Greening and she is represented by Miss Owens.

 

The hearing began on Monday 10th February 2014, it continued yesterday 11th�February�2014 and concludes today, Wednesday 12th February 2014. 

 

I have heard oral evidence from the Key Social Worker Miss Brigid Gribbin, Dr Ward a Consultant Paediatrician gave evidence by video-conferencing link, and I have heard evidence also from the Guardian in this case.  The mother and father decided not to give oral evidence.  However, I have before me the statements from the parties, reports and other key documents which have been considered by me.

 

The background

These applications relating to Ja and M were part of a wider number of applications concerning in total five children of this family.  The proceedings started in August 2013 and in the case of the other three older half-siblings (that is Jo, fifteen, S thirteen and K five) I made Residence Orders on 24th January 2014 in favour of their birth father Mr D and his partner, coupled with Supervision Orders for a period of twelve months.  Additionally, provision was made for maternal contact in relation to those older children.

 

I found that the threshold criteria for making those Supervision Orders had been established on the basis of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the Local Authority's Threshold Document which was dated 14th August 2013, coupled with an additional finding that the children's educational/social development was likely to be impaired by the mother's failure to secure their school attendance.

 

In January 2014, the Local Authority were permitted to keep open their findings in relation to M and Ja.  The Local Authority's Final Care Plans for M and Ja (see Section C) proposes placement for both children outside the birth family by way of adoption.  This would be a closed adoption in relation to the parents and the older siblings; i.e. there would be no face-to-face contact, only Agency letterbox contact.  The current inter-sibling and parental contact would be tapered and eventually it would come to an end.  The Local Authority would strive to locate adopters for both children together, but if this could not be achieved they would pursue separate placements while promoting inter-sibling face-to-face contact between M and Ja if they were to be separately adopted.

 

The mother and the father opposed the Local Authority's Plans for M and Ja initially and as recently as the Issues Resolution Hearing in January 2014 they sought rehabilitation of both children to their care.  The parents while maintaining separate addresses, presently cohabit for much of the time.  At the outset of this hearing, however, the parents acknowledged the inevitable and they accepted that they could not offer M and Ja the standard of care which both of these children require.

 

There is no other suitable familial carer in the extended family which has been identified in this case.

 

Accordingly, the parents contend for long-term foster care for the children together, while maintaining face-to-face familial contact at a monthly frequency ideally (from their point of view), including of course wider inter-sibling contact with the older children.

 

The mother has made significant concessions with regard to the threshold findings (see D101) and both parents accept that the threshold is established in this case.  The Local Authority has always maintained that the parents have been neglectful in their care of M and Ja prior to their removal from parental care last year.  In particular, it is alleged that the children suffered from a chronic lack of stimulation and that their medical/physical care was neglected.  These allegations were refuted by the parents to some degree in whole or in part.

 

If the parents were pursuing a case for rehabilitation at this hearing, then it would have been necessary to reach an adjudication upon these particular aspects.  However, in a case where firstly, the parents have accepted that the threshold is met, secondly, have made significant concessions in respect of the threshold, and thirdly rule themselves out as familial carers and accept that the choice of placement for these children lies between long-term foster care and adoption, it is, in my judgment, unnecessary to reach a determination about all the Local Authority's findings.  So far as the parents and the Guardian are concerned, they do not urge me to take a different position.

 

Accordingly, on the balance of probabilities I find the threshold to be established on the basis of the findings made by me on 24th January 2014, supplemented by the concessions contained in the mother's position statement (see D101).  In other respects, I make no findings about the Local Authority's Threshold Document and the findings remain open.  The parents have given no evidence about these aspects.  There is medical evidence in the papers about these matters.  I have not dismissed the allegations nor have I found them to be proven.  No determination has been made about them one way or the other.

 

The Guardian in her final report supports the Local Authority's Plans for the children but she acknowledges that the issue is a finely balanced one.  In her oral evidence to me yesterday, the Guardian said that there was no right or wrong answer.  There were pros and cons for each option and she said:

 

"I have gone full circle at certain stages during the hearing.  I've thought different things".

The children continue to live with their foster carers (who I shall identify as L and G) and their own three children who are eight, eleven and thirteen respectively.  L is a qualified nurse and M and Ja have been provided (it is commonly accepted by all parties in this case) with a very high standard of care indeed.  The parents continue to exercise frequent contact with the children three times a week and the quality of that contact from the contact records (see Section I) appears to be generally satisfactory.  The parents attend regularly and for the limited periods of contact they manage to interact with and entertain the children reasonably well.

 

The children also have contact of course with their older half-siblings and there is a particularly close bond (it is accepted) between S and M.

 

M and Ja have been the subject of Interim Care Orders since 14th August 2013 and they have been placed (as I have said already) with the same foster carers.  The case was transferred to the County Court and timetabled for this hearing.

 

I need not dwell upon the parental shortcomings since they are identified in the Threshold Document prepared by the mother.  There have been historic concerns dating back to at least 2004 about parental care.  M after her birth did not thrive and she was re-admitted to hospital on several occasions because of concerns about her weight and general development.  There was a Child Protection registration on 13th June 2013 and thereafter a further hospital admission for M on 21st June 2013.  Initially, M was accommodated by foster carers after her discharge from hospital, and this arrangement was formalised after the inception of protective proceedings in August 2013.  The Guardian (as I have said) has observed that the placement options for M and Ja are finely balanced and at the heart of this issue lies the substantial identified needs of both children.

 

The children's medical reports

I have three sources of medical information about these children (see Section E).  I have reports by Dr Phillips and Dr Ward on M and Ja respectively.  I also have available to me a recent update, namely the pre-adoption medical examinations undertaken by Dr�Bos.

 

Having regard to the concessions made with regard to threshold, I wish to concentrate upon the underlying medical concerns about these children rather than make further reference to the sections of the reports which are critical of past parental care.

 

Historically in relation to M there were concerns about:

 

(i)	her faltering growth;

(ii)	eczema;

(iii)	a marked plagiocephaly; that is to say a flattening of one side of the head and torticollis (a twisted neck);

(iv)	developmental delay and in particular gross motor delay; and

(v)	a deviation (squint) of the left eye and possibly also of her right eye.

Both children were small at birth; the mother I note is quite petite in appearance, the father is not.

 

Since her admission into foster care, M has received (as I have said already) care of an exceptionally high standard and she has made progress.  She has gained weight, her movement has improved, the plagiocephaly is less noticeable and the range of movement in the neck has also improved, although her posture is affected by a tendency for the head to be angulated to the right.  That at least was the position in December�2013.  The eczema had cleared up by that time.

 

Ja is a complex child; there is no overarching diagnosis and his difficulties are considered to be multi-factorial in origin with biological and environmental components.  Dr Ward's assessments in November 2013 proceeds in the following way:

 

"Ja presented as a slightly dysmorphic child with � significant global delay [and] with particular difficulties in the areas of social interaction, communication and play." [E56]

He had also demonstrated aversive feeding (E56).  Physically, J appeared to be reasonably well.

When Ja came into foster care (see E53):

 

"It was three to four weeks before eye contact was made.  He did not respond to voice and did not acknowledge M or anyone else.  He did not turn when his name was called.  � However, gradually his interaction improved and he now demonstrates an excellent relationship with his carer.  He goes for a cuddle, holds her hand and initiates interaction.  He enjoys playing with toys."

There are concerns that Ja may be short-sighted and a follow-up ophthalmic appointment is awaited.  His dental health was poor largely because of his diet of sugary milkshakes and baby food whereby he developed an aversive feeding pattern and a dislike of some food textures.

Ja continues to attend Special School [name of school given] and there is information about his progress there (see E54).

 

"Staff at school had expressed concern that Ja exhibited repetitive behaviour.  He was seen to peer through cracks in the door.  He liked being in a cardboard box and repetitively felt around the edges.  However staff at school have seen a huge difference in his behaviour and he is now making progress both socially and academically.  He is beginning to use his hands to paint; previously he was averse to messy play."

In relation to his gross motor development (E54):

 

"Ja was walking when he became Looked After but was unsteady when he arrived.  He kept falling over the door threshold.  His mobility has improved but he still has difficulty in coping with slopes and kerbs.  He tends to climb up the slide and crawls upstairs on his knees.  He walks hand-held.  He comes down the stairs on his bottom or is hand-held.  He is not yet able to kick a ball or peddle a trike.  Overall his gross motor development is at around a fifteen month level.  He is able to rise to standing from sitting on the floor.  He was seen bottom shuffling at times although he is able to walk.  He has low central tone."

I observe that with a developmental level assessed at around fifteen months, that is of course less than one half of Ja's chronological age.  So far as his fine motor development is concerned, those skills are assessed at the twelve month level.

With regard to his language and communication skills (see E55):

 

"Ja was initially quite silent and then started to vocalise loudly.  The foster carer stated that he had no recognisable words used purposefully but makes lots of sounds.  He has double babble and waves and claps.  When he is excited he flaps his hands.  He also flaps his hands when singing songs such as 'Wheels on the Bus'.  He loves interactive games and is beginning to join in nursery rhymes such as 'Row, Row, Row the Boat'.  Language and communication skills are still below and twelve month level."

In relation to his self-care skills:

 

"He drinks from a lidded beaker (initially a bottle).  However, he no longer feeds from a bottle and uses a doidy cup.  He has also progressed to a normal cup although he tends to spill a lot.  He is not yet toilet trained and he is still in nappies.  In the course of the assessment, Ja was seen rocking.  This tends to be worse at bedtime.  His carer stated that he initially rocked constantly and on occasions rocked from the bed onto the floor.  He also tapped objects constantly.  Ja likes the colour red and is attracted to objects such as fire extinguishers.  He likes to hide under a blanket and pulls a blanket over his head.  On his first night in care he slept on the floor.  However, he now sleeps happily in a bed.  He takes a long time to settle to sleep, taking up to an hour and a half.  However, he is content in bed and does not cry.  He is happy touching the walls.  He is now beginning to come out of his room at night like a normal toddler.  He occasionally bangs his head repetitively on the bed-frame.  He enjoys lights and things that flash.  He enjoys 'cause and effect' toys and an iPod.  His play is not obviously obsessive or repetitive and is now more exploratory."

According to Dr Ward (see E59), Ja remains a child:

 

"� with significant delay in all areas of development including gross and fine motor development, play skills and cognitive function, speech and language development and self-care skills."

There is a discussion of the possibility of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in Dr�Ward's report (see E60).  This is not medically excluded, despite the mother's denial of alcohol misuse.  Cognitive development is of course a reflection of biological and environmental factors and developmental difficulties are often multi-factorial.  Congenital factors have resulted in a vulnerable child whose difficulties have been exaggerated by inadequate parental care (see E61).  Dr Ward's view is:

 

"Ja has very significant developmental delay and is likely to continue to have needs significantly above his peers in terms of cognition, communication and care throughout his childhood and into adult life".

Concern has been expressed about certain autistic behaviours, but this will require a further assessment of his social interaction, communication and social imagination and repetitive/obsessional behaviour.

 

His needs are considered at pages E64 to E65:

 

"Ja needs more than 'good enough' care by carers who are able to accept the uncertainties of his prognosis and the complexity of his condition.  Ja needs to experience consistent care and routine, and insightful care by carers who are able to understand his difficulties in understanding the world around him and the impact of sensory issues.  Ja needs good levels of stimulation, an appreciation of using non-verbal communication, encouragement of play, self-care and social interaction.  It is essential that carers are able to work in partnership with professionals in Health, Education and Social Care to ensure that his needs are met.  In health terms Ja needs the following:

(i)	input of multi-disciplinary team to address his developmental needs;

(ii)	community paediatrician � a paediatrician would monitor his general health and growth and act as a co-ordinator of general health and therapeutic input;

(iii)	speech and language therapist to address language, communication and feeding difficulties;

(iv)	physiotherapist � Ja is able to walk independently, but motor coordination is immature;

(v)	occupational therapist input regarding his fine motor and self-care needs;

(vi)	early years specialists focusing on play and cognitive development;

(vii)	Ja has special educational needs and an assessment of his future needs and education should take place;

(viii)	ear nose and throat; Ja has a tendency to snore and some upper airways obstruction.  He requires assessment by an ENT specialist to check for adenoidal and tonsilar hypertrophy.  Hearing has been checked and found to be satisfactory;

(ix)	ophthalmology � Ja has seen an orthoptist and optician; he is thought to be short-sighted but it is difficult to test him at his stage.  Testing should be repeated as he becomes older;

(x)	orthopaedic surgeon � review of a shallow acetabulum to exclude hip dysplasia/risk of dislocation;

(xi)	dietician - support the carers and guidance regarding adequacy of diet.  Ja currently receives one carton of Paedisure per day to supplement.  This will require review;

(xii)	input in a joint feeding clinic would be helpful to carers to address his feeding problem;

(xiii)	genetics � it may be helpful for Ja to see a geneticist.  I have referred to recent developments in genetic testing including the microarray test which may be appropriate in his case; and

(xiv)	Ja may benefit from input from a clinical psychologist with an interest in children with special educational needs and difficulties with social interaction to help him make sense of his life experiences."

This high level of care at home and significant support in the classroom and with his health generally, will be required throughout his childhood and into adult life (E66).   It is said on behalf of the Local Authority that this package of care (whilst available locally) could be replicated at other centres within England and Wales by way of health/educational provision.

 

The recent updates by Dr Bos on both of these children underline the particular needs of the children.  So far as Ja is concerned:

 

"Ja was seen by Dr Sathyamoorthy in September 2013 and she felt his development level was below eighteen months.  Today I felt his skills might just be above the eighteen months level, but his language development and complexity of his play are below the eighteen month level.  As Ja is now three and a half years old his developmental rate is less than half.  This is generally called a severe learning difficulty. �

� Ja also had intra-uterine growth retardation, the underlying cause of which is unknown.  He has severe developmental delay.  He is generally a happy and placid boy who enjoys the attention of his carer.  Physically he appears to be healthy.  Although long-term predictors are extremely imprecise, the most likely outcome for Ja is that he will need special education throughout his childhood and probably will need to live residentially or heavily supported as an adult. �

� Although the developmental profiles are somewhat different my feeling is that Ja [and M] may have the same underlying but as yet undiagnosed condition.  Although both have had chromosome tests returned normal, referral to the North Wales Geneticist is appropriate for the consideration of more detailed chromosomal analysis which has recently become available in Wales".

Dr Bos will make that referral.

In relation to M, Dr Bos says:

 

"M is delayed in her gross motor skills."

He goes on to say:

"Considering the information today her gross motor skills are at seven months level while her language skills and understanding of toys have reached a nine month level."

Chronologically of course M is thirteen/fourteen months old.

The summary is as follows (and I quote from Dr Bos' report):

 

"In summary, M was born with intra-uterine growth retardation i.e. was born much smaller than expected for her gestational age.  M has developmental delay.  An estimate of the prognosis can only be vague as M is still so young.  My impression today is that M may have moderate learning difficulties but they could turn out to be only mild with the passing of time.  M's development will need to be monitored".

Dr Ward's oral evidence emphasised that Ja needed a period of stability, both in his home life and in his school environment.  He would find it difficult to manage changes in his environment which would have to be well planned and gradually implemented.  For an adoptive placement, the complexity and uncertainty about his condition made him a difficult child to place with adopters.  Consistent care might not be enough to effect a significant improvement in Ja's circumstances if there was a genetic component in his presentation, and of course that required further investigation.

 

Similarly in M's case, a concluded prognosis could not be given and there was therefore significant uncertainty with regard to her also.

 

It is within this context that the current foster carers for M and Ja have offered to care for both of the children.  Indeed the foster carers have told the Key Social Worker that they are looking at larger properties to enable Ja and M to have their own bedroom, as M currently remains in the foster carer's bedroom (see B103).  The Guardian also told me that the foster carers were investigating the possibility of grants being made available to them by the Local Authority, to enable them potentially to extend their home or to assist in searching for another property.

 

M and Ja have integrated well with the foster carers who have demonstrated over a period of six/seven months their ability to offer a high standard of care;  "Second to none" was the description the Guardian gave to me.  The Guardian also said to me that the foster carers potentially see themselves as the 'forever' family for M and Ja.  The children's place of course within that foster family replicates their situation in the birth family, because there are three older children within the same home in the birth family as well.  The female foster carers own mother has developed a significant relationship with the children (I was told). 

 

The Guardian (see paragraphs 10.8 to 10.11 of her report) identifies, it seems to me, a number of important ingredients:

 

"These children have complex needs.  They will benefit from experienced parents.  It is difficult to find placements for children with complex needs with uncertain prognosis.  These children, particularly Ja, are going to need a significant amount of support not just throughout their childhood but into adulthood.  Any adopters are likely to need lifelong support not just the usual three years that are guaranteed.  These children have the right to a 'forever family' however their current carers who are tried and tested have indicated that they would like to be long-term foster carers for Ja and M.  These children are much loved by their foster family and well-established with their family grouping.  I have observed the three children of the foster family to interact with and accept Ja and M as younger siblings.  The foster mother is a qualified nurse and well placed to meet the children's complex needs.  She has indicated that she would be willing to promote sibling contact between the children and their half-siblings within her home.  The foster family would not consider adopting Ja and M or becoming their Special Guardians on the basis that they will need a varying degree of social work support in order to successfully parent the children.  It is also their view that their own children benefit from the services available to them as children of a fostering family".

After a slow start in Ja's case, he has settled into his new home.  He is settled in his school where he can make progress.  Both children would retain links with their wider family of course in foster care, which would be lost to them in any adoption.  The prospect of achieving adoption is uncertain (perhaps extremely uncertain), with a limited supply of potential adopters for children with such complicated needs to fulfil.  The Guardian (at paragraph 10.7 of her report) identified 1,800 children awaiting adoption in England and Wales with only 500 approved adopters.  The Key Social Worker could identify only two potential couples within the North Wales Adoption Consortium; one for a sibling group and one for a single child.  These were not promising statistics, although of course I accept that the picture with regard to the availability of adopters is a constantly evolving one.

 

The Guardian accepted (as indeed do I) that the foster carers have a genuine reason for wishing to remain as foster carers for M and Ja as opposed to becoming Special Guardians or Adopters.  As I have noted, they require the long-term support (both financial and other support) which they felt only the Local Authority could provide.

 

The support given to adopters could be more limited, and this was of concern to the Guardian.  However, what tipped the balance for the Guardian in favour of the Local Authority's Plans was the prospect of M (and perhaps to a lesser extent Ja) remaining in foster care throughout their minority.  On balance, she believed that the prospect of attaining a joint adoptive placement for both of these children (or indeed a placement for Ja alone) was an unlikely one.  Her concerns about placement breakdown were real because of the demands of the children, and these appeared to be matched whether a placement were a long-term foster placement or indeed an adoptive placement.

 

The placement of the children

It is accepted (as I have said) that the parents lack the capacity to parent these children to a 'good enough' standard having regard to their complex needs.  In accordance, therefore, with the decision in North Yorkshire County Council v B [2008] 1FLR 1645, I can rule out rehabilitation to the parents in the circumstances of this case.  The parents could manage intermittent periods of face-to-face contact, but not 24/7 care for both of these children.  If full time care were attempted by the parents, I believe the children would be likely to suffer significant harm once more.  

 

Having found the threshold to be established under Section 31(2) of the Children Act 1989, the next aspect is the scrutiny of the Local Authority's Care Plans, applying the paramountcy of the children's welfare under Section 1 of the Children Act 1989 and Section 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.

 

The Plans propose placement by way of adoption and in accordance with the guidance given in the case of Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, they are accompanied by a pros and cons analysis.

 

McFarlane LJ in the case of Re C [2013] EWCA Civ 1257 has disapproved of the practice of treating applications for Care and Placement Orders separately where there are conjoined applications for these Orders.  I refer to paragraphs 28 and 29 of his judgment.  Such an approach (it is said) may restrict:

 

"� a proper holistic evaluation of the central welfare question".

Since I have made threshold findings already, I have jurisdiction to make Care Orders and also to make Placement Orders in the latter instance under Section 21(2)(b) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  I have to scrutinise the Care Plans carefully and consider the children's individual welfare as paramount under Section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989 or their welfare throughout their lives as paramount under Section (1)(2) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  I have to apply, of course, these 'checklist' provisions under Sections 1 of both statutes to the facts of this case.

 

In accordance with the Convention, the Plans must be a proportionate response to the risk of harm.  That was decided in the case of Re C and B [2001] 1 FLR 611 (see paragraph 33 and 34).  In Re B [2013] 2 FLR 1075 the Supreme Court has recently emphasised that a Care Order (and particularly a Care Order with a Plan for adoption) should be considered as a "last resort" (see paragraph 74 to 77 of Lord Neuberger's judgment).

 

In support of these applications for Placement Orders in the case of both of these children, I have the application with a Statement of Facts and an Annex B report in each case.   Both of the children (as I have said) are physically healthy and a pre-adoption medical has already taken place on 22nd January 2014.  The Agency Decision-Maker ratified these Plans on 23rd January 2014, prior to issue on 3rd February 2014.  Therefore the preliminary requirements of the Adoption Agencies (Wales) Regulations 2005 (as amended from 1st September 2012) and Section 18(2) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 have been complied with.

 

I can only make a Placement Order if the consent of the mother and the father is dispensed with under Section 52 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, since they share parental responsibility for the children.  I can only come to that conclusion by applying the paramountcy of the children's welfare throughout their lives and (as I have said already) by applying the provisions in Section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  That section has to be applied also when I come to any decision regarding the adoption of the children, and that includes of course the making of a Placement Order (which is the combined effect of Section 1(1) and Section 1(7) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002).

 

In Re B-S recent guidance was offered in the case of placement applications:

 

(i)	consistent with the least interventionist approach, adoption is a last resort (see paragraphs 23, 26 and 27 of the judgment);

(ii)	the Court should consider carefully the assistance which a local authority could provide for parents (see paragraph 29).  In the circumstances of this case, that is not a material consideration;

(iii)	there must be evidence available from the Local Authority and the Guardian addressing each realistic option for placement together with a reasoned recommendation (see paragraph 33 and 36 of the judgment).  I have that information in the documentation before me and the oral evidence which has been provided; and

(iv)	Judges must give adequately reasoned judgments analysing the options and giving clear conclusions (see paragraphs 41 and 48 in Re B-S).

The Local Authority maintains (having weighed up all the pros and cons) that the balance comes down in favour of the Local Authority's Plans as proposed.  Reliance is placed upon the case of Re T [2008] 1 FLR 1721 and the well-known passage from paragraph 17:

 

"Even if there is a real possibility that an adoptive placement will not be found it by no means follows that adoption is not in the best interests of the child.  � Mere uncertainty as to whether adoption will actually follow is not a reason for not making a Placement Order".

In Re T of course a distinction was drawn between the potential difficulty of placement, and children who were not suitable for adoption and required specialist therapeutic foster care as a prelude to any adoption.

Reliance was placed also upon the case of Re P [2008] 2 FLR 625 which deals of course primarily with the requirements of dispensation of parental consent, but also emphasises that a twin-track approach (where foster care and adoption are both potential outcomes), can legitimately be pursued.  The Local Authority contends in this case for a time-limited search looking for adopters for a period of some twelve months, and accepting the Guardian's suggestion in that regard.

 

My attention was drawn also to the case of Re V [2013] EWCA Civ 913 where at paragraph 96 of that judgment Black LJ drew attention to the distinction between foster care and adoption, and in particular emphasised their different aspects:

 

(i)	the permanent nature of adoption;

(ii)	the fact that adoption of course applies for all time;

(iii)	that the regime of contact under adoption is very different to that of a Looked After child within the ambit of a Care Order; and

(iv)	that the quality of the experience for a child is very different within an adoptive as opposed to a foster care placement because of the intrusion of the Looked After Child system.

It seems to me that these decisions in the case of Re T and Re P must now be viewed within the context of other recent decisions.  It is quite true that neither Re T nor Re P were overruled in more recent authorities, but the authorities have to be reconciled and there is some tension (it seems to me) between the thrust of the authorities quoted by the Local Authority and those quoted on behalf of the parents.

 

So far as Re B-S is concerned in paragraphs 19 to 22, the following passages are of significance:

 

"20.  	Section 52(1)(b) of the 2002 Act provides, as we have seen, that the consent of a parent with capacity can be dispensed with only if the welfare of the child 'requires' this.  'Require' here has the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, 'the connotation of the imperative, what is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable'.  This is a stringent and demanding test.

21.  	Just how stringent and demanding has been spelt out very recently by the Supreme Court in In Re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria) [2003] 2FLR 1075 �

22.  	The language used in Re B is striking.  Different words and phrases are used, but the message is clear.  Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are 'a very extreme thing, a last resort', only to be made where 'nothing else will do', where 'no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interests', they are 'the most extreme option', a 'last resort � when all else fails', to be made 'only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short, where nothing else will do.' �"

There is of course no guarantee that the Local Authority will approve the childre's current carers as long-term foster carers for M and Ja, although the Key Social Worker said that there was "nothing she knew of to indicate that they would be unsuitable as long-term foster carers".  There are in fact only two other long-term foster carers available within the area, and it is generally recognised that foster carers are a scarcer resource even than adoptive carers.

 

The Local Authority of course maintains that because of these children's particular needs, their disability merits a greater degree of protection than might otherwise apply in the case of other children.  There is a need for family life to extend beyond the ages of eighteen in the case of M and Ja.  If the Court were to conclude in this case that because of their inherent difficulties these children could not be placed, what difference would there be between this case and other similar cases where children with special needs might be the subject of Placement Order applications?  If the Court were to adopt a blanket approach of that kind and refuse such applications, the Local Authority contends that this potentially would be a discriminatory approach, whereby children who had disabilities and special needs would not even be afforded the opportunity of a search for a 'forever' adoptive family.

 

The response made on behalf of the parents to that argument is essentially this; we are not dealing here with a general, we are dealing with a particular.  We are dealing with the case of these particular children and their particular requirements and what is sui generis so far as these children are concerned is the availability of the current foster carers potentially being able to offer a high standard of care for both of these children for the foreseeable future.  That of course cannot be guaranteed but it is potentially available in a situation where the alternative (namely adoption) at present appears to be more uncertain.

 

That, in summary form, is the argument presented on behalf of the Local Authority on the one hand (supported by the Children's Guardian) and by the parents on the other hand.

 

The factors in relation to each type of placement

In the case of foster care, some of the factors of course are valid for the current placement but some are of more general application.  It seems to me that the following factors apply:

 

(i)	the current foster carers have demonstrated an ability to care for the children already to a very high standard;

(ii)	the children are well settled and they are integrated with their foster carers and with the foster carers' family and they are cared for together, and potentially this could be continued;

(iii)	the female foster carer's nursing qualification is a positive advantage;

(iv)	the foster carers have available to them all the support which the Local Authority can offer to these children throughout their minority, including of course respite care which might well be of benefit in this case;

(v)	foster care offers the prospect of maintaining familial relationships (parental and sibling) otherwise lost during childhood and potentially impaired throughout life;

(vi)	the current educational and health provision appears to be suited to the children's needs, although I recognise that they could be replicated in other parts of the country if the children were to be found adoptive placements out of area;

(vii)	the foster placement could break down if circumstances changed and the Local Authority would then be forced to implement contingency plans and this might of course be less likely if adoptive placements were secured for the children;

(viii)	the nature of the relationship between foster carer and fostered child when contrasted with adopters and adopted children is of course a very different one.  Adoption more closely replicates family life, without continued interference by statutory agencies.  Of course in this case because of the children's particular needs they will be the subject of external agency intervention (educational, medical and so on), and post adoption support will also probably be necessary for any adopters taking on these children.  The children's awareness of being looked after children may of course be more limited, bearing in mind the children's particular developmental progress;

(ix)	there is real uncertainty about whether adoption in practice will be achieved and if so when it will be achieved, even during a time limited search.  In short is the safer immediate option of foster care (hopefully with the existing carers) reprersenting the 'bird in the hand' better than a yet to be captured bird of bright plumage in the tree above (representing as it does the possibility of adoption);

(x)	adoption of course is a lifelong relationship; foster care may not be.  Having said that, both of these children, and in particular Ja, have significant needs well beyond their childhood which may require (at least in Ja's case) Leaving Care assistance and potentially Adult Social Care intervention throughout his life.  That at least appears to be the information provided to me by the medical experts at present.  This safety net may be as real for these children as may be the commitment of any adopters to them throughout their childhood.  The very fact that an adoptive status exists does not of course guarantee any kind of particular support by an adult adoptive carer for adoptive children once they attain their adulthood.  The position is much the same as a birth parent with regard to a child of the family.  Of course there are important emotional links between an adult child and his or her parents, and they may be recognised by the parent as the child grows into adulthood, but there is no legal requirement upon any parent to support his or her child once that child attains the age of majority.

The statutory provisions 

The wishes and feelings of the children cannot be elicited under Section 1(3)(a) and 1(4)(a) of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002 respectively.

 

Having identified (as I have already) the children's needs, their age, their sex and other characteristics under Section 1(3)(b) and 1(3)(d) of the Children Act 1989 and 1(4)(b) and 1(4)(d) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, what other factors are relevant to this equation?

 

Section 1(3)(e) and 1(4)(e) of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002 respectively relate to parental care, which of course is not an option in this case.  Accordingly, the capabilities of the parents under Section 1(3)(f) of the Children Act�1989 does not materially assist with regard to the placement options in this case.

 

The children (and particularly Ja) are likely to be affected by a change in their current circumstances and with regard to his school, which of course is relevant under Section 1(3)(c) of the Children Act 1989, but that process potentially could be managed with care and attention.

 

The loss of direct familial links to be replaced by life-story work is also an important factor under Section 1(4)(f ) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  

 

Furthermore, under Section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 I have to consider the children's welfare throughout their lives, and under Section 1(4)(c) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 the likely effect upon them throughout their lives of having ceased to be members of the birth family and becoming adoptive persons.  This is a much longer timescale than simply the children's childhood. In many cases, the benefits of an adoptive placement throughout childhood, creating firm and secure attachments which offer a firm foundation for adult life, often outweighs the loss of this direct familial relationship.  That is why, in cases where the threshold of significant harm is met, Parliament has allowed the Family Courts of England and Wales to make non-consensual adoption orders, where it is proportionate and necessary to do so.

 

In this case, however, the balance is not so clear cut.  I disagree with the conclusion of the Local Authority and the Guardian in this case.  Applying the factors that I have identified above, I ask myself do these children in these circumstances require adoption; i.e. is that imperative rather than optional, reasonable or desirable?  I would answer that question in the negative.

 

Some might say that a conventional outcome for children as young as these (where they cannot return home and where there are no alternative familial carers) would be adoption and not foster care.  The foster carers themselves may well share this belief (as the social worker told me in her evidence), but there should not be a conventional response to any application in relation to a particular child.  I have the real prospect of attaining good quality foster care for both of these children from two good people and their family, who have demonstrated this already.  That is what makes this case sui generis.

 

A period of uncertainty and delay while a search proceeds may restrict (albeit subtly) the foster carers' unguarded emotional commitment to the children, because of the lurking possibility that the children may leave their care.  There is, therefore, a very real downside to the making of a Placement Order just to 'give it a go' and to see what turns up with regard to the availability of suitable adopters.

 

It seems to me that the use of the word 'require' under Section 52 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 enjoins me to identify a decisive benefit, clearly favouring adoption, as opposed to another less intrusive Order.  In the particular circumstances of this case, I cannot do so.  Accordingly, I conclude that adoption is not a proportionate response for either of these children and I could not approve the Local Authority's Care Plans in relation to them.  Secondly, I could not dispense with parental consent in this case and I could not make Placement Orders.

 

I am entitled to ask the Local Authority to pause and to think again, as was decided in the case of Re S and W [2007] 2 FLR 275, 283 (see paragraph 30).  Sometimes the intransigence of a Local Authority forces a Judge to choose between the lesser of two evils (see Re S [2002] 1FLR 815, 838 paragraph 94), but that point has not been reached in the circumstances of this case.  It is suggested that where there are conjoined Placement and Care applications and the Court finds itself unable to approve a Care Plan for adoption and make Care and Placement Orders, the Court should afford the Local Authority an appropriate opportunity of taking stock, before proceeding to dismiss the Placement Order application and making Care Orders but without approving the Care Plan (see Plymouth County Council v G [2010] EWCA Civ 1271).  In this case, the Court's favoured Plan of foster care (if possible by the current foster carers) requires of course the making of Care Orders, because the discharge of the existing interim Care Orders and return of the children to parental care would be positively harmful for both of these children.

 

Accordingly, I propose to adjourn both of these applications for the Local Authority to reconsider the Care Plans.  As was said by Wall LJ in the case of Re S and W (to which I have already referred) at page 284, paragraph 35:

 

"It is, we think worthwhile pausing for a moment to reflect on why a Court is entitled to exercise a discretionary jurisdiction to adjourn in order to invite a local authority to reconsider.  The answer we think is that much of what we have said already is self-evident.  Care Proceedings are only quasi-adversarial.  There is a powerful inquisitorial element.  But above all they are proceedings in which the Court and the Local Authority should both be striving to achieve an Order which is in the best interests of the child.  There needs to be mutual respect and understanding for the different role and perspective which each has in the process.  We repeat: the shared objective should be to achieve a result which is in the best interests of the child."

If the Local Authority agrees to modify it's Care Plans, I would expect revised Final Care Plans to be available after the adjournment.  The parents I assume would agree to the placement change, and the Guardian can tell me about her position at the adjourned hearing.

 

Contact within long-term foster care would need to be reduced, so that the children could become more settled in their new home.  In that regard, I would accept the Guardian's evidence about the frequency of such contact at six times per year (at least initially), to coincide with holiday periods.  The management of any contact, within long-term foster care, would be the subject of statutory review, and how precisely parental and inter-sibling contact with the older children is to be managed would be a matter largely for the Local Authority's discretion.

 

I propose, therefore, to adjourn these applications for a period of approximately three weeks, to give the Local Authority the opportunity of taking stock of my judgment.  I do not necessarily expect them to approve the current foster carers within that timescale, but I do expect them to have reflected upon the judgment today and to be able to afford me some answer as to whether they are proposing any modification of their Care Plans.  In which case, I can make further directions to finalise these applications or (if they do not) whether I am then driven to consider what is the lesser of two evils with regard to the outcome of these applications.

 

I propose then to reconvene at some stage around 5th March 2014 (depending of course on the availability of the advocates) to see what the Local Authority's answer following this period of reflection might be.

Her Honour Judge Brown sitting at Milton Keynes.

The Parties.

The court is concerned with a child F, who is nearly three years old. 

Her mother is Ms. W.  Throughout this judgment I shall refer to her as Mother or Ms W.  

Her father is believed to be a man named M H.  To date Mother has not provided the local authority or any party to these proceedings with his contact details.  He has therefore played no part in these proceedings.

The local authority is Buckinghamshire County Council.

F is represented through the Children's Guardian,  Ms. Crossby.

This matter came before me in May 2012 when I heard the final hearing of the care proceedings in respect of F.  I handed down a written judgment on 1st June 2012 and made a Care Order and a Placement Order.   This judgment should be read together with the judgment dated 1st. June 2012 in which I set out in some detail the background and history to this matter.  I will not repeat that here.

Mother appealed the orders made and the matter went before the Court of Appeal on 19th. September 2012, when the appeal was dismissed.  

Despite a Care Order and a Placement Order being made on 1st June 2012 and the appeal being dealt with by 19th. September 2012, F had not been placed for adoption by the local authority by 25th. April 2013 when Mother made her application for permission to revoke the Placement Order.  It serves no purpose for me to set out my concern and disappointment that F had not placed by this time.

Mother last had contact with F on 18.4.2013.

Once Mother issued her application, the matter came before me on 24th June 2013.  Unusually, the local authority and the Children's Guardian supported further assessment of Mother by Dr. Adshead, the adult psychiatrist who had reported in respect of Mother in the previous proceedings.  Given that the placing authority required this further evidence, I simply listed this matter again after the intended receipt of this further expert evidence. The addendum report is dated on 23rd. August 2013 and notes improvements in Mother's mental health.

Having received this report the matter came back before me for further directions on 5th. September 2013.  At that hearing, the local authority supported Mother's application for permission to revoke the placement order and sought further assessment of Mother's parenting abilities.  The Children's Guardian opposed the granting of permission at that stage.  I took the view that the issue of whether permission should be granted was not straight forward and that oral evidence would be required at a substantive hearing.  However, as the local authority, the authority with the responsibility for placing F, considered that further assessment was required before proceeding to place F, I adjourned M's application pending receipt of the report from the Court Assessment Service, making no findings or giving any indication of the merits of Mother's application for permission to revoke the Placement Order.  The Children's Guardian was concerned about the delay on F of this assessment but took a realistic view that given the stance of the local authority, the assessment must proceed.

The report was completed by Ms. Smith of the court assessment service and is dated 7.11.2013.  Ms. Smith does not make a recommendation as to whether the Placement Order should be revoked or not but sets out the strengths and weaknesses of Mother's arguments that there has been a sufficient change in her circumstances to warrant further assessment.

Having received the report of the court assessment service, the position of the local authority is that permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order should not be granted.  This stance is supported by the Children's Guardian.  The matter therefore needed to be set down for a substantive hearing.  The matter has come before me over four days, far longer than such an application would normally take to be litigated.  

I say at once that I have found this a difficult case, as I did the initial care proceedings.  I have therefore allowed a great deal of latitude to enable Mother fully to put her case and I heard from a number of witnesses, namely;
Ms. C, (Mother's therapist), Dr. Adshead, (adult psychiatrist), the maternal grandfather who I have referred to as MGF, Mother's partner Mr. B, the maker of the court assessment report Miss Smith, Mother, the social worker Ms. Chambers and the Children's Guardian Ms. Crossby.

Therefore at the commencement of this hearing the position of the parties was as follows.

On behalf of mother it is submitted that she has made sufficient changes to meet the first stage of the test required for permission to revoke a placement order and that given the evidence of mother's improved mental health difficulties, mother's prospects of success of revoking the placement order are sufficiently high that  that permission should be granted and further assessment undertaken.

The key changes relied upon are as follows;

Her improved mental health.
Her stable relationship with Mr. B to whom she is engaged to be married, the wedding being due to take place in May 2014. They met through a website in August 2012.
The fact that her oldest son TM has moved back from his grandparents to live with her.  He had lived with his grandparents from June 2007 until June 2013.
Her improved relationship with her parents, in particular with her mother.
She lives in new accommodation which is not specially adapted for any disabilities.



On behalf of mother it is submitted that there should then be a further period of assessment in the following terms.  It is expected that there would need to be a period of introduction between F and M as the last contact was in April 2013.  The local authority and the children's Guardian submit that a psychological assessment of mother's fianc� Mr. B would be required.  It is accepted by all parties that although mother has made significant improvement in her physical functioning, mother would not be able practically to care for F without a substantial package of physical support and therefore a thorough assessment by the complex needs team would be required.  It is accepted on behalf of mother and forcefully submitted on behalf of the local authority and the children's Guardian that the further assessment required before there could be any question of placing F back with Mother, would be between four and six months.  Clearly F would have to be increasingly involved during this period of assessment.

The local authority and the Children's Guardian accept that whilst there have been changes for Mother, they are not of a sufficient degree or as the Children's Guardian puts it, "the right changes" to cross stage one of the two stage test required at the permission stage.  Both submit that mother's application should fall at this stage and that I do not need to consider stage two namely the "prospects of success stage."  However, it is submitted that if I find that stage one is crossed, the prospects of success are so low particularly when balancing F's welfare, that I will be driven to the conclusion that permission must not be granted.  The Children's Guardian in particular is strongly of the view that there must be no further delay for F in making decisions about her long-term placement.  

F was placed with her current Foster carers when she was four days old.  Consideration was given to these carers being considered as adoptive carers after the placement order was made.  However there were concerns about the proximity of these carers to mother's home and as I understand it, they were therefore rejected as prospective adopters.  However they have been reconsidered by the local authority and they are due to be considered at a matching panel on 24th. February 2014.  On the basis that they are approved as prospective adopters and depending on the judgement of this Court, the placement of F with them will change to a formal placement for adoption and the local authority will support their application for adoption of F.  Therefore the plan of the local authority, strongly  supported by the Children's Guardian, is that F should remain in her current placement for the rest of her minority as an adopted child and that the settled placement in which she is thriving will be secured.  The local authority, supported by their children's Guardian, submits that a long and rather drawn out process of further assessment which they say would be required would be deeply disturbing and upsetting to F, would be emotionally harmful to her and this risk of emotional harm to F is not merited when considering what they argue are low prospects of success.

The evidence.

I turn firstly to considering the evidence in this case.
The first witness I heard from was mother's therapist who for reasons of confidentiality I will refer to as Ms. C.  

Ms. C filed a report dated 30.5.2013.  She has been working with mother since 3.5.2012 and sets out in her report the work that she has completed with mother. She writes,
" as a result of the above treatments, Ms. W has improved considerably over time.  I am very pleased with her progress, while I am not a diagnostic psychiatrist, I have completed psychopathology professional development training and my assessment is that Ms. W no longer meets all the necessary criteria needed to fall within the borderline personality diagnosis as described in the DSMV."

She continues, "Ms. W is able to see her relationships with others in a more flexible and understanding way now and as a result has been able to let go of a role as victim.  This has been one of the hardest parts of therapy for Ms. W.  Understandably the circumstances in relation to her children have not helped her however we have done a significant amount of work to help her to empathise with others.  When Ms. W first came to see me she felt that she was being victimised by the authorities, by her mother and by her ex-partner Mr. H.  We have progressively worked to help Ms. W to understand and see things from the other perspective.  She seems readily able to do this in all except her relationship in regards to her ex-partner, however having known Ms. W for some considerable time now and have been seen evidence of her ex-partner's continuing aggressive attitude towards her, this does not surprise me and I think she may well be prudent in remaining cautious."

Ms. C writes further on in her report,
"Ms. W also continues to maintain a strong and stable relationship with her other children, consistently putting their needs before her own."

"Ms. W has shown that she is able to keep her mood stable despite the very difficult circumstances.  She has continued to attend all her sessions even after the court case deciding the outcome of the children's care was resolved.  I predict that Ms. W will continue to improve.  She is forming stable relationships and is in fact engaged to be married to a man who appears to be a stable decent moral Christian, he is aware of all of Ms. W's past and is supportive of her."  Any impulsive behaviours that were diagnosed a year and a half ago no longer appear to be present.  Ms. W does still on occasion need advice as to how to deal with certain situations however she is happy to ask for this and takes advice well."

In evidence Ms. C confirmed that she had started to work with mother from March 2012 initially for twice weekly sessions reducing down to weekly sessions from March/April 2013.  Ms. C told me that mother, "engages extremely well and does "all her homework that she is set."  In her view Mother has,
"improved enormously."  Ms. C told me that when she first started working with mother there were frequent phone calls as well as these sessions but she said, "I've had no phone calls outside of the sessions for a whole year."

The therapy has focused on problem-solving and feeling empathy for other people. Ms. C believes that this work has enabled her to change her reactions to her mother and therefore improved that relationship.  Ms. C explained when Ms. W was with her mother, she would react in a childlike way but this dynamic has now changed.  Ms. C reported that in her view, Ms W's relationship with her mother is now stable and good.

Ms. C told me that she has done a lot of work with mother to try and help improve the ability to work with professionals and has assisted mother in understanding the perspective of social services.  In Ms. C's view, mother has made enormous improvement in all of these areas and she repeated her opinion in her written report that at the present time mother is not showing any traits of a borderline personality disorder.  Summarising she said, "We've improved her relationship with her mother, she is less of a victim and she is able to process things without blaming other people, she is in a stable relationship with her partner and her mother and she has made a number of friends to."  In relation to her progress Ms. C told me that mother tends to make great inroads and then plateau and then makes progress again but she told me this is normal and that this has been a constant pattern since 2012.  Ms. C told me that she is confident that mother will continue with therapy whatever the outcome of this case and she made the important point that mother continued to engage in therapy despite the making of the care and placement order and post the Court of Appeal decision.

Ms. C has also seen mother's fianc� Mr. B in one session.  Ms. C told me that Mr. B engaged very well and seemed to be very aware of what difficulties there may be in the relationship.  

Ms. C has not met mother's former partner Mr. H.  Ms. C told me that in her view Mother has "progressed enormously in this area although mother still has concerns about his attitude towards her." 

One of the concerns expressed by Dr. Adshead, in her report namely that mother would bring F into the conflict between her other three children and Mr. H, Ms. C.   told me that in her view in the last six months, mother has tried very hard not to draw the children into that.

Ms. C accepted that most of her information was self reported from Ms. W but she was keen to emphasise that she does not take everything said to her by Mother at face value.

Ms. C expects M to be in therapy for a further 6 � 12 months.

It is important to note that Ms. C had not seen my judgment or the rest of the court bundle.  She was asked to read the report of Ms. Smith prior to commencing cross examination.

At the beginning of cross examination, Ms. C told me that Mother had raised with her all the keys issues raised within Ms. Smith's report and she has worked with Mother to address them.
Asked about Mr. H's attitude towards her Ms. C accepted that Mother still believes that Mr. H is acrimonious towards her but that Mother is not 100% convinced  about the causes of the accident.  Ms. C's opinion is that Mother is now more "balanced" in her view of Mr. H.   Ms. C told me,
"When she first came to see me she was absolutely convinced that he was involved and her view has changed that he may be involved � she's more pragmatic about it."  Ms. C told me that Mother's beliefs that the police were in a conspiracy with Mr. H have, "never been conveyed to me."  Nor has Mother conveyed to Ms. C that social services were in a conspiracy with Mr. H.

Ms. C was cross examined about Mother's "dishonesty" as the local authority sees it, when giving false information to professionals.  A great deal about this will be said in due course.  However, of interest to me was Ms. C's view that,
"Therapy is normally a very honest relationship � I think it unlikely that someone would be consistently dishonest � most clients come with an honest perspective � it is generally an honest relationship."  I specifically clarified with Ms. C that was her view as I was anxious that I had made an accurate note of that particular opinion.

In respect of the specific questions put to Ms. C, understandably she did not feel able to comment on the specific examples relied upon by the local authority.

Ms. C told me that in her view Mother's opinions are now, "more balanced" and that they are not, "black or white but are "shades of grey."

Ms. C told me that although Mother has never expressed a view that social services are in any sort of conspiracy she believes there is a bias towards F being adopted because it is , "too expensive" to have F placed back with her.

A particular part of the evidence in relation to Mother's contact with one of her children T was put to her.   This paragraph has been referred to often throughout the hearing and therefore I shall set it out in full.  It is part of Ms. Smith's statement and relates to a contact between Mother and three of her other children.

"Ms. W told me that after I had left the contact T asked why her mother had not seen them on the last contact date of 28th. September.  T said that her father had told them that the contact was cancelled by their mother as "she had something better to do."  Ms. W explained to T that this was not the case and "snapped" saying something she should not have said.  She told T that her father had stopped the contact as he was "blackmailing" her, claiming he had not received maintenance payments.  S and C were not part of the conversation; Mr. B sat quietly in the room and listened�.
Ms. W spoke of her feelings towards T.  She said, "My daughter feigns affection towards me, she tells lies about me to A (Mr. H's partner) and Mr. H."  Ms W believes that T has told them that during contact, she (Ms. W) spends time in bed.  Ms. W said, "she is turning into her father's daughter I'm afraid."  She said Mr. H surrounds himself with women, he is charming and brain washes them.  She described T as being "quick to be aggressive."  She said that T was helping the twins to assemble one of their birthday toys and T shouted at C asking her if she wanted help or not threatening to break the toy.  Ms. W said that S has no confidence and said,
"They will all turn into T, they will hate me."  S and C told her that T "hates her."

Ms. C told me that Mother had told her about this and said,
"we did talk about it and she felt awful about it and felt really quite distressed � she really felt bad it had happened."

Asked about Mother stating that T "feigns affection, " Ms. C said, "If she said that, that troubles me � I don't think a child would feign affection � What Ms. W thinks is that T is torn between the two of them."

Ms. C told me that she "had challenged" Mother about recording her contact with her children.

In re-examination, Ms. C was asked about her views that the therapeutic relationship is usually "honest."  Ms. C told me that she expected patients to tell her the truth, "as they perceive it to be," and that everyone has a different map of the world.  She said, "I don't accept this map of the world as being genuine or correct.  It's occurred to me that Ms. W could have been faking good.  In my opinion she has been candid in the sessions."

I then heard from Dr. Adshead.  In her addendum report she writes the following,
"I have been asked to comment on whether Ms. W has made progress.  I have noted the contents of Dr. L's reports and the reports of Ms. C.  I would agree with these clinicians that there seems to be some clinical improvement.  This would be entirely consistent with my 2011 assessment which was that Ms. W had a treatable personality disorder.  I took the view then that she could make progress if she was offered appropriate therapy and I agree with Ms. C and with Ms. W that (having engaged in treatment) she has made progress.
I believe that she still has some symptoms of personality dysfunction, but there has (in my view) definitely been some degree of remission; and the condition is less severe than it was.  I think she will need to continue to work in therapy; especially to address the on-going difficulties with her ex-husband.  I think there is some shift in her belief that she is in danger from him, but she is still engaged with him in a profoundly negative way."

Dr. Adshead then addresses one of the key issues in the case, namely Mother's ability to accept and co-operate with a package of practical support to assist her in caring for F.    She writes,
"It appears that Ms. W's attitude has softened somewhat and she is saying that she will work with social services to "co-parent" F.  I am mindful that Ms. W does not find co-parenting with her ex-husband easy; and I am concerned she may not find it easy to work with social services, if this option were pursued."

Dr. Adshead concluded this report as follows,
"In summary I would suggest there is evidence that Ms. W has made psychological improvements and has better affect regulation and better sense of responsibility and agency.  According to her therapist she sees herself less as a victim and is therefore less frightened and antagonistic towards others.  It remains to be seen whether this change will manifest itself in relation to social work professionals."

In oral evidence Dr. Adshead stood by her report and did not wish to make any alterations to her conclusions.  She stated the following,
" I thought there have been changes.  If one looks back to 2008/2010 there has been a great deal of change, clearly mother does not have such a disordered state of mind as she had back then, for example there are far less contacts with the police services.  Ms. W's mental state has definitely improved and it is consistent with what I hoped would be the case with treatment.  There was a mild to moderate degree of dysfunction and this has improved with treatment and I am pleased to see there has been some improvement.  Since 2011/2012, it is apparent that there are areas where Ms. W has made improvement - she has an improved relationship with her mother, the evidence is that this is less rigid.  However what concerns me is that she can present themselves in different ways in different situations and to different people.  My interpretation is that generally Ms. W is managing her anxiety much better than she was as she is less distressed and frightened.  My impression from reading the materials is that when she is in a situation where she feels anxious or challenged she reverts back to being antagonistic or rigid.
When she is with her therapist she is able in that environment to be thoughtful and reflective about her difficulties but in situations where she feels more anxious there are possibilities for her to be more defensive again and what she says in those situations is less insightful or thoughtful."

Dr. Adshead told me that over time people who are  suffering from a borderline personality disorder can improve their capacity to regulate thoughts and feelings, which could improve their ability to make and maintain relationships and which will also improve their sense of well-being.  However she stated that the best analogy to understand this is considering a patient with diabetes where the patient suffers from a disregulation of glucose control.  The diabetes can be controlled but the patient still has diabetes.    Dr. Adshead told me that in her opinion, Mother had a mild to moderate degree of personality disorder which was much worse in 2004/2005.  Dr. Adshead this may have deteriorated due to depression after the birth of the twins and that with the passage of time and with therapy her mental state has greatly improved.  Dr. Adshead accepted that, having listened to the evidence of Ms. C, Mother has worked hard in therapy and this has paid off with an improved capacity for mood regulation.  Dr Adshead also stated that mother's ability to have positive relationships may have improved given that she has a new relationship with a partner and that her relationship with her mother is improved.

Asked about mother's risk of relapse Dr. Adshead told me,
" it is real but very difficult to say what the size of risk or the time scale of that risk is."  Dr. Adshead told me that if Mother were to become depressed then the risk of relapse would be higher.  She told me that the triggers for relapse are developing clinical depression, emotional disruption in a relationship, bereavements, illnesses or any situation which causes extreme or intense anxiety  or psychological pain.  Dr. Adshead concluded this report as follows,
	
She told me that in a disregulated system a sudden big challenge could disrupt a remission which has been established.

In terms of whether Dr. Adshead saw F not returning to Ms. W's care, or returning and Mother having to cope with a three year old, Dr. Adshead saw both as potential stressors and could not put one higher than another.

Under cross-examination on behalf of mother, Dr. Adshead told me that she accepted that mother had received appropriate therapy and that the real gains in such therapy will have been made in the first 18 months to 2 years.  She told me that there is not much evidence that prolonged therapy after that period of time brings about significant change.  
Dr Adshead was asked about the past reports of Dr. Lowenstein and Dr. Holt.  Dr. Adshead told me that where she disagrees with Dr Lowenstein, is that he seems to have a rather "old-fashioned view" of personality disorder, namely that you either have it or you do not .  In Dr. Adshead's opinion, it is perfectly possible to have some degree of personality disorder and  become better or worse and that there is a spectrum of symptoms.
It is perhaps important to note that Dr. Adshead remains certain of her view that her original diagnosis that mother has a treatable borderline personality disorder is the correct diagnosis and that has proved to be the case as Mother has shown improvements with appropriate therapy.  Dr. Adshead repeated that Mother has made improvements since 2008 and she is "cautiously hopeful" that Mother can maintain the gains she has made.  Asked if she is optimistic about Mother's continued progress Dr. Adshead said,
" I am not not optimistic -  mother has made an engagement made gains.  I'm not sure I have a view about what will happen next but I accept it is likely she will continue to engage in therapy."  She repeated that the greatest gains that people make are in the first 18 months of therapy and that any further gains after that are smaller and over a longer period.  Dr. Adshead noted that the two areas where Mother has made less gains are her negative feelings towards her ex husband and her continued suspicion of social services.
Dr. Adshead also conceded that there may have been improvement in Mother since she saw her for assessment in August 2013, since she has continued with her therapy.  In short Dr. Adshead accepted that mother has developed some insight over the last two years with therapy.

Under cross examination by the local authority, Dr. Adshead pointed out that she is giving evidence as an expert in psychotherapy of people with personality disorders whereas Ms. C is a therapist actively involved in the treatment of such a patient.  She was clear that she was not ranking that level of expertise but simply pointing out the difference of perspective.  Dr. Adshead was also asked about Ms. C's opinion that therapy is usually an "honest" relationship.  Dr. Adshead did not consider this necessarily to be the norm but pointed out that she very frequently works with people who are law breakers.  She also pointed out that people have therapy for many different reasons, some feel under pressure, some have very mixed feelings about it.

Dr. Adshead told me that Mother may engage so well with Ms. C because she is in the safety of a therapeutic relationship in which she is able to appreciate that people are not as against her as she believes.  Mother is able to reach out for help to a therapist.  This is a very different focus to working with social services.

Dr. Adshead was asked about a reported comment by Mother about part of her report.  In her report Dr. Adshead wrote the following,
E17 paragraph 12,
"Ms. W told me that she had a new partner Mr. B whom she had met on line.  She said that they were engaged and hoping to marry next year, he said that he had split up from his wife and had two sons aged seven and nine.  Ms. W said that Mr. B's ex-partner was also rather controlling and manipulative, like her ex-husband.  She said that she liked Mr. B because he seemed, "so normal."  She went on to say that Mr. B had regular contact with his children and that she hoped that the boys would come and live with her and Mr. B after they were married.  She told me that she feels she has made a bond with Mr. B's eldest son who has just been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome and has been seeing a counsellor."

In the report of the social worker carrying out of the court of assessment service report at E40 paragraph 4.1.10, the following is reported,
" she agreed to a psychological assessment, 8.5 hours over 3 days, she thought she was doing really well.  Referring her to Dr. Adshead's comments about Ms. W and Mr. B's plans to have his two sons lived with them, Ms. W said she did not say this, it had been misconstrued.  In her opinion what was asked of her by Dr. Adshead was if some awful tragedy befall their mother, would she and Mr. B take care of them and in those circumstances she replied of course they would."

Dr. Adshead denied that she had asked Mother this question and was clear in evidence that Mother had said that which she had reported in her report.

She told me very clearly that she would not have asked what they would do if a tragedy befell the mother of Mr. B's children.

Of Mr. B, Dr. Adshead pointed out that it is very important that he knows of the diagnosis and really understands how this impacts upon how Ms. W may react.

Dr. Adshead pointed out a part of Mother's statement which caused her concern.  At C63 of Mother's statement she writes,
"I am not blind to the fact that my physical disadvantages might mean that both F and I will have to make adaptations to how we work on a daily basis and that there will be times when I will have to rely on others for support but this should not be a bar to F being placed in my care."

Dr. Adshead pointed out that three year old children do not "make adaptations" and she is concerned that Mother would expect too much of F.

Dr. Adshead expressed her concern that the intense challenge of being a care giver to this three year old child may trigger a relapse and pointed out that this may have been one of the factors in Mother's decline in mental health in 2008 after the birth of the twins and when a single parent to four children.  She is very concerned about the effect on Mother of caring for a three year old whose attachment is disrupted and who may not be a biddable easy child to care for.  Dr. Adshead told me,
"I would describe it as a stressor that might stretch Ms. W's capacities more than she anticipates."

Dr. Adshead told me that one of the concerns she has about Mother's attitude which is quite pervasive is that Mother believes people lie about her and this has an impact upon her ability to work with third parties.

I then heard from Mother's father who I shall refer to as MGF.  I had the opportunity to hear him in evidence in the previous proceedings.  I was told the  maternal grandmother was unwell with a cold and therefore could not give evidence.
MGF told me that Mother's relationship with her mother has improved and is now a "normal relationship."  They see each other "quite often" and Mother spent Christmas with her parents which went well whereas before, "it was under stress."  Mother's oldest child TM (16 years old) now lives with M.  He is reported to be doing well and he sees his grandparents at least once per month.

In terms of what the grandparents could offer, MGF told me that he and his wife would be prepared to move down to the Aylesbury area to be near Mother.  They own two houses in Lincolnshire, one is rented out.  They would sell both houses in order to buy a house in the more expensive area.  They also have a daughter who lives in Buckinghamshire who has a child.  MGF considered that he could offer between 15 � 20 hours a week of support.  The MGF told me that he would be prepared to intervene if he considered that Mother was not acting in the best interests of F as he has done so in the past (as set out in the previous judgment.)

MGF told me that has been a gradual improvement in particular in how Mother relates to her Mother.
MGF told me that at the moment contact between Mother and the children is suspended.  AT first MGF told me this was because Mother had not paid �5 per week towards child maintenance the backlog is now running at �250.  Contact has been suspended since October 2013.  MGF told me that he has tried to broker an agreement and has now instructed solicitors.  When pushed MGF accepted that the other reason for a suspension in contact is because, "she was supposed to have said something inappropriate to the children."  Ie the comment already referred to that Mr. H was "blackmailing mother."  In fact it was established that contact resumed after the first disagreement about maintenance and stopped again after the comment.  The real reason therefore seems to be that in Mr. H's mind, mother has spoken inappropriately at contact.

After the contact MGF took the children back to Mr. H's home.  T apparently told her father what Mother had said.  He is reported to have said,
"T has just told me that Mother said I was a blackmailer � I'm not having that � all contact are off and he told me to f off."

The situation is now that these three children are not seeing their Mother, grandparents or their older sibling TM.  MGF told me that he had not noticed any problems in the relationship between T and Mother.  It was put to him that Mother had said that T "feigns affection".  MGF told me, " I don't look at things in that light � I wouldn't have said that � she seems to interface with her quite normally.  Perhaps Mother expects more from the children than normally a child would give to an adult.  My wife gets on well with the children but they don't show a lot of affection."

MGF told me that in effect he and his wife would be prepared to "do what grandparents do."

Asked on behalf of F what support he would actually give he told me,
"I can't see what we would need to support her for � if I'd have more of an opportunity to think about it � she does have a physical disability � at times this inhibits her � it takes a while for her to get ready to go out."

PGF told me,
"My wife and I want to keep F in the family � we will do what is necessary � we are not sure what that is."

In terms of practical arrangements MGF told me that he had only just signed a one year lease on one of the properties and therefore if required to move down he and his wife would rent first before selling the two properties and buying a house in the local area.  He accepted that moving down would mean he lived in a "much less attractive home in a much less attractive area."

MGF told me that Mother's relationship with her other sister remains very strained and they do not have contact.

MGF told me Mother can walk around her home and he has seen her walk up to 15 metres.  She cannot stand for long periods and has to sit down because she is weary.    Mother could not walk F to the park, she would have to be in a wheelchair and F in a buggy.  Mother takes a long time to get ready and needs to take a lot of medication.  Mother cannot move around the house quickly.

MGF told me that he likes Mr. B and approves of the relationship.  He told me that he finds the idea of F being adopted as, "intensely disturbing."  He told me that forced adoption is, "crude and barbaric."

I then heard from Mr. B (mother's partner.)  Mr. B has filed two statements both of which I have read.  Mr. B had been given the opportunity at the beginning of the hearing to read through the bundle.  He told me,
" it gave me a lot of headaches, there was a lot to read but I have a better knowledge of Mother's past and her personality disorder."
Mr. B told me that he and Mother are planning to get married on 17th. May 2014.

Mr. B told me that he has a very good relationship with MGF.  He told me that he has two children who are now ten and six years old.  He separated from their mother two years ago.  He was greatly involved in their care when living at home and immediately post separation. 

Asked about mother, Mr. B told me that she is a very good communicator and described her as "well balanced" in her character and "very co-operative."

He told me that he considers mother to be "very patient and good at picking up how her children are feeling"

Asked about her ability to cope with Mr. H, he told me that she does not react with anything he comes up with and does not rise to any of the problems.  Mr. B was aware that mother had told one of the children that  "he's blackmailing me".  Mr. B told me that he was present at that time and that mother was, "very very regretful.  I think she realised it as soon as she said it."

Mr. B accepted that he told the social worker when he first met her that he did not have any children of his own.  He told me the reason for this was because he did not want them dragged into anything else and that it was for their protection.  He told me that he sees his role in respect of F as one of co-parenting and supporting mother.  He intends to continue with his employment but would do as much as he could within the home outside of working hours.  He told me that if he saw anything which concerned him in respect of F he would challenge it straight away and ask why Mother had said or done it. Asked what he thought the impact may be on mother of parenting a three-year-old who may be difficult cause a relapse in Mother,  Mr B said,
" I don't think that would happen - she is very good at working under pressure - emotionally she is very stable - if she has F back there can be no greater motivation than that - if anything happen I would be there to support her and my priority will be F.  F would be my main concern  -  I don't know what else to say."

Under cross examination Mr. B accepted that he didn't really know very much about a borderline personality disorder but told me that in his view it does not affect her very much now at all.  He told me that mother is not a negative person, she has changed for the better since he has known her, that she is patient in any life situation, doesn't let things bother her and that if she does react it is only slightly.  

It was put to Mr. B that the reason mother gave him as to why her children were initially removed, namely that she had accommodation problems, was not really true.  Mr. B told me that he did not think they should have been removed from her care.  He told me that the person he read about in some of the reports is,
" a totally different person to the person I know now."

Mr. B was asked about his own children.  At first mother met his two children during his contact.  A vicar then told Mr. B's ex wife that his new partner had had five children removed from her care.  Given that information, Mr B's ex wife stopped contact unless Mr. B would undertake that the children would not be brought into contact with mother, until she knew more about the situation.  Mr. B took exception to this and there then followed a period of 6 months when Mr. Beer only had indirect and telephone contact with his boys, despite his ex wife being prepared to permit contact in the absence of Ms. W.  Mr. B told me this was "out of principle."
Asked how this stance affected his boys Mr. B said,
"I don't know � they seemed OK � I felt it was the right thing to do."  Mr. B told me that he had explained to one of his children that the reason he was not having direct contact with them was because,
"Mummy is not letting you see [Ms. W] because she doesn't like her and I am trying to sort something out."

When later challenged as to whether he thought this was really the right thing to tell his son, he told me that he thought it was.  According to Mr B, his sons reaction to having contact stopped was that he was, "very angry because he got on so well with[Ms. W.]"

Mr. B also told me of his anger towards the vicar who had alerted his ex wife to the concerns about Ms. W.

Asked about the exchange between mother and T at contact, Mr. B accepted he was present and that he heard the exchange and accepted he did not intervene because, "it wasn't my place."  The only criticism Mr. B would make about the whole situation was, " I think it was out of line for Mr H to tell T that which was untrue."  
Asked about mother's comment that F "feigns affection", Mr. B commented that T was more distant than the other children and was not as affectionate.

Mr. B was asked whether he believed that mother's car accident was caused by Mr H.
The short answer to that question is that Mr B does believe mother when she has told him that Mr H caused or was responsible for involving others in causing an accident.

Mr B believes that Mr H paid somebody deliberately to smash into mother's car.  At the time of the accident there was another passenger in the car.  I asked Mr. B whether he really believed that Mr H would be able to convince someone to get into a car with somebody else (either with or without their knowledge) with the express intention of smashing into mother's car to kill her or cause her serious injury.  I gained the impression that Mr B had not really considered the facts as presented by mother in any great detail but had simply accepted mother's strongly held view that she was the victim of this conspiracy.

Mr B told me that one of the reasons he believes mother is because on the several occasions they have discussed this accident she has been able to give the same details every single time. It was put to Mr B that he had told Ms. Smith that the police were probably involved in a cover-up as well (E47) but when challenged about this he said that he could not remember saying that.

Mr B told me that he and mother did challenge each other if they disagreed with each other and that they would talk things through.

I then heard from Ms. Smith.

She has filed and served an assessment report which is at E35 of the bundle and runs until E88.  I say at once that I found Ms. Smith's written report of enormous assistance.  It is long and detailed and I do not see the benefit of transcribing lengthy parts of it into this judgment.  It needs to be read in its entirety.  It presents the positives and negatives of the case put by Mother at this time.

Of concern in the report is Mother's continued belief that she was the victim of a conspiracy to kill her and persecution my Mr. H.  I have no evidence from Mr. H and have never seen him give evidence.  I therefore have no first hand account of his side of this long running story.   Whilst it may well be that Mr. H is a very difficult man who behaves unpleasantly towards mother and her parents, Mother's view of Mr. H is extreme.  I was particularly struck by paragraphs 4.1.1 through to 4.1.2o E39 � 42.  The examples that Mother gives go far beyond the normal concerns that are so often raised between parents who have difficulties in communicating about their children over contact issues.  Mother still appears to be of the belief that Mr. H has had her followed, has tried to kill her and that she appears hyper vigilant of people around her who may be connected to Mr. H, believing that a nurse who treated her in hospital and a woman at a petrol station, are both associates of Mr. H.  In the case of the nurse, Mother believes she felt  some malicious intent towards her.  In this regard I refer particularly to paragraphs 4.1.19 and 4.1.20 E42.

Miss Smith addresses what for me remains a key concern in this case namely,
"In my opinion, any professional working with Ms. W must be aware of her mental health diagnosis the gains that she has made in therapy and the treatment that remains outstanding.  Ms W has certain personality traits and communication style.  She may at times appear hostile and dismissive when perhaps she's feeling intimidated, not heard or dismissed.  Mr B described this as a defence mechanism.  She may appear to be stubbornly rejecting of advice or guidance.  I have not seen this myself but I have not had to deliver this form of professional advice.  There is a theme in her account of past events of her feeling victimised, veiled by multiple agencies, that was not her fault.  She still has a tendency to view others as being in the wrong.  Her thinking remains rather rigid on these subjects.  She does not appear to have reflected on the path and considered whether she had made any contribution or taken responsibility for any of the difficulties she encountered."  E73.

Asked about Mr B's attitude towards contact with his own children, Miss Smith told me that she is concerned that he sought to prioritise his relationship with mother over that with his boys.  Asked about the issue with T in contact, Mr. B gave the impression that he was irritated with the child and places some responsibility on her for telling her father what mother had said.  Ms Smith told me that mother had not expressed any regret or remorse for the way she had spoken to T.  She felt uncomfortable with the way mother spoke about T and was particularly concerned by mother's comment that T, "feigns affection."  Ms Smith had concluded in her report that the relationship between mother's three children (who live with their father) and herself is, "bleak."  

Miss Smith told me that in her view what mother had said to T in contact was not acceptable but that the impact on T appears to have been lost.  She did not seem to have understood that T had been placed in an impossible position.
She told me that Lincolnshire social services where the three children live have had no contact with them since December 2011.

Ms Smith told me that during the assessment she saw in Mother symptoms of paranoia and of mother continuing to believe that she is a victim.  She is concerned that mother's rigid thinking continues particularly have a fixed view that the local authority cannot be trusted.  In her view it would be challenging for the local authority to work openly and honestly with mother.  Ms Smith was concerned about the information mother had given to the complex care team.  The assessment of the complex care team is in the bundle at aC47.  I say at once I have not heard from the author of this report who is  Ms James. 

However at C55 under the date 17th. April 2013, there is a section which reads as follows,
"Ms. W said she had both her children at home living with her.  TM is 16 and F is 2.  F goes to her aunty in [ ] and during the day TM is at school in [ ].  A friend Mr. T completing most of the practical task within the home including helping F to bed.  Ms. W informed me that her friend Mr. T is living there and is completing most practical tasks to support her and helps with caring for children."

In a further part of the report dated 14th. May 2013, there is a paragraph which reads as follows,
"Updated information from Sonia Chambers, Children's Team.  Ms. W's children do not live with her.  Her son lives with her grandparents in Lincolnshire and her daughter lives in Aylesbury with plans to be adopted."

Miss Smith had addressed this section of the report both directly with Miss James and with Mother and I have paid particular attention to paragraphs 4.11.4 and 4.11.5 E68.  In oral evidence Ms. Smith confirmed once again that she had spoken with Ms James, that what she had written was an accurate record and that mother had convinced her that the two children were in her care at the time of the assessment.  Ms. James had commented to Ms Smith that as an experienced worker she had felt fooled.  Ms. Smith is also concerned that the information which appears to have been provided to the David Lidington MP at  does not appear to be accurate.(B9)
I then heard from mother.  

For the record I should say that Mother read from a statement which she had hand written.  She wanted to be able to read the note out in full.  I allowed her to do so, I have taken note of its contents and it is at C80 and 81 of the bundle.

I should note that after Dr. Adshead had given evidence, Mr. George (Counsel for Mother)  informed me that mother had "remembered" that she had a recording of the interview with Dr. Adshead and that she wished to produce it to show that Dr. Adshead's recollection of this interview was inaccurate.  No party had heard this recording but Mr. George transcribed a part said to be relevant to the issue.  That transcription is now at C75 � 76 of the bundle.  There has been no independent verification that this recording has not been tampered with or in any way doctored.  However, Dr. Adshead was invited to respond to the fact that she had been recorded and what Mother had said about this.  The court received a response which is at C78.  Dr. Adshead expresses her concern that Mother taped the sessions covertly.  She notes,
"I am puzzled that Ms. W did not discuss recording our interview.  This is by no means an unusual request and I am always happy for this to happen; as long as there is then a chance for the recording to be transcribed and agreed later.  It is highly unusual for people I assess to record covertly and suggests a high degree of suspiciousness.  Without an agreed transcript I have no way of knowing whether this is a complete recording or whether relevant material has been deleted."
Dr. Adshead commented that,
"The excerpt provided confirms that we were talking about where Mr. B was living and whether his sons were living with him and what might happen after they were married. "

In a note of a telephone conversation between solicitor for the child and Dr. Adshead which is at C77 of the bundle Dr. Adshead is reported to have commented,
"She didn't understand why it had taken so long to say that there was a recording.  If she'd been asked she would have allowed her to record and they could have agreed a transcript if that was thought to be necessary.  Gwen said that this tends to show the personality disorder in action as it relates to the way that she deals with people with whom she sees she may be in conflict."

Mother produced at court the CV of a woman named AC who Mother put forward  as someone who could assist with the full-time daily care of F and herself .  

Mother was asked her view now of whether she is suffering from a borderline personality disorder.  Mother told me that she found that question difficult to answer because as she put it, her therapist Ms. C has identified that she can be very overcritical of herself and her levels of ability so she tries not to do that.  Mother told me that she is not trouble now by feelings of paranoia and does not experience excessive ups and downs of mood or "quick unthought through reactions."  Mother told me that she believes she is far more able to be rational and to think things through.  She plans to continue to see her therapist whether or not F is returned to her care.

It was put to her that Dr. Adshead thought mother was still negatively emotionally involved with Mr. H but mother denied this saying that if she felt anything at all it was boredom.  She told me the following,
" my only wish is that he would grow up and mature and that his responses would be more adult and less reactive, that he would move away from tit for tat and his aggressive attitude and his wish to use the children as spies in his camp and just get on with life as I have done."  Mother expressed her hurt that in her view he continues to use the children to hurt her.

Asked about the incident with T, mother gave a rather detailed explanation of how I should view the word "snap."  She told me that she was describing her "inner patience", not an outward explosion towards the child.  She then told me what had happened in her view and told me that T had spoken to her in "an accusatory" tone of voice.  Mother told me that T behaved like a "turncoat" and told me that she had been distant in a contact and was then overly affectionate when she said goodbye.

Mother told me that T is an intelligent child and pointed out that she (Ms. W) has an IQ of over 130 and that Mr H has an IQ eight points higher than her.  Mother told me that T is being brought up with her father's ethics namely that it is all right to lie as long as you don't get caught.  She described T as being in a "bubble of confusion and anxiety with someone who is very manipulating." 

Mother told me that her feelings now about contact with the children are remorse, regret and mostly a calm resignation that "if I don't give Mr. H what he has wanted all along I'm putting my children at risk."  "He wants me to slit my wrists, to commit suicide � he has adhered to that opinion from day 1."

Mother was asked why she had not informed Dr. Adshead that she was recording their meeting.  She told me that she wanted a record of what was said in order that she could play it to Ms C.  However when asked whether she had in fact done that she told me she had not.  She was clear in her view that she had not told Dr Adshead that Mr. B's children would be coming to live with them .  She took the view that Dr. Adshead had simply misunderstood what she had said due to the pressure of time constraints.

Asked about the assessment by the complex care team in April 2013 mother told me that she thought this was an informal visit for the purposes of assessing her disability due to the fact that she was going to have to be rehoused.  She had been given two months notice and she was very concerned about where she would be moved to.  Mother told me in evidence that she had made it clear that TM would be living with her in the future but she was adamant that she did not say that F was living with her at the time.

Under cross examination mother was asked her views about the break in contact between Mr. B and his children.   Mother told me,
" it is not ideal, in some ways it did anger me - the complete disregard shown by his ex-wife for the children's welfare."

When asked whether given her history Mr. B's ex wife was justified in being confirmed mother said, "yes in some ways as an initial response," but she would have expected her views to have changed over a period of six months."  Mother's view of the difficulty was in my judgement interesting and instructive as she said the following,
" her demands were that she wanted to see the court paperwork about my children, nothing less will satisfy her, she closed the door on every option other than to go head to head in court, she couldn't respect the point that I was not allowed to release information, she had to protect her children and I had to protect mine.  She had a complete disregard for a rational logical explanation and I had to help Mr B find a way of communicating which was not obstructive.  Her way of dealing with this angered me and it made me more determined to support Mr. B, using my knowledge of negotiating with someone with that frame of mind I guided him by doing some of the e-mails in reply, putting forward options and keeping him calm when he was speaking to the boys on the phone."

Mother described Mr. B's ex wife as "aggressive and closed minded."

In evidence mother told me that she thought Mr. B's decision not to have contact was "short sighted."

According to mother she encouraged Mr. B to have contact with his children. 

According to mother she has always been entirely open and honest with Mr B about her past and the court proceedings.

Mother was asked at some length in the witness box about the car accident which left her with such serious injuries.  Suffice to say, mother's evidence can be summarised as follows;
She continues to believe that Mr H paid someone to cause the car accident which caused her such serious injury.
She was nursed by a nurse who is a friend or associate of Mr H, who told her of  H's involvement and who tried to cause her physical harm whilst she was in the hospital.

However mother told me that she does not believe that the police are part of the conspiracy but that their lack of action against Mr H is because they are overworked.

Mother told me that her relationship with T is strained .  She believes that T has been influenced against her by her father.  Mother told me that as T is older and in order to "stay in her father's good books, she has adapted to the role of spy in order for her father to be proud of her."  She told me that her relationship with her children has "always been tainted with negativity" and that as far as Mr. H is concerned he has not allowed her to be part of the children's lives.

When challenged about why she had taped Dr. Adshead and why she had not informed Dr. Adshead that she was being recorded Mother told me,
"She would refuse to do the assessment and then tell the court that I have refused to do the assessment.  I made the recording because I needed to know if there was any specific advice that I needed in respect of my own therapy."

Mother told me that she had only raised the issue of the recording after Dr. Adshead had left court as she explained,
"I was not aware I still had the recording � it took a lot of finding."

Mother was asked why there had not been a detailed family discussion between herself, Mr. Beer and her parents as to what support package they could offer.  Mother told me that she'd had these detailed discussions with her mother on the telephone and, "I can't help Your Honour about why MGF didn't know about these discussions."  Mother told me that it was "easier" to have these discussions with her mother.

Mother told me that her helper in her home, Mr. M has moved on and is no longer being put forward as part of her support package.

Mother told me that in terms of specific support required she considers that she requires therapeutic support for a longer period of time to allow for life changes and to see whether she can regularly utilise her coping skills and mechanisms.

Mother was asked about information she had given to her MP David Lidington.  A letter from him is at B9 of the bundle.  

The letter is from David Lidington to the chief executive of Buckinghamshire County Council.  The first paragraph sets out the facts and he states they were presented to him,
"My constituent Ms. W of [ ] has been to see me about her housing situation.  Ms. W, her [ ] son and her two year old daughter and full time carer live in a house which is owned by Buckinghamshire County Council, but leased to [ ].  The family have lived there since July 2011 when Ms. W was able to leave [ ] hospital where she had been recovering from serious spinal injuries."  

Mr. Lidington goes on to set out Mother's concerns about facing eviction and stated,
"I am sure you  will understand that I am very concerned indeed at the prospect of a vulnerable, disabled woman and two dependent children being put out on the street�"
(At the time of writing this letter neither TM nor F resided with Mother.)
Mother denied telling Mr. Lidington erroneous information and said, "I don't know where he got that conversation from."  According to Mother she told the MP that TM was going to live with her and that F was placed for adoption.  

Mother told me that she accepts the diagnosis that she has a personality disorder and said,
"I still need more support than a normal person with complex arrangements � I need people to be clearer with me about what they expect of me. The solicitor on behalf of the child cross examined Mother at some length about her beliefs in respect of the car accident.  Mother told me that she has proof that Mr. H was involved in organising the car accident.  She produced a Facebook which is at C79 of the bundle.  The Facebook page is dated 18th. February 2011.  On that page is an entry,
"Angie Lea can u lend me �12,500 and get me a car???"
Mother believes this is evidence that Mr. H was trying to get money to pay someone to cause the accident.

In evidence Mother told me that a nurse had "told her" that Mr. H was involved.  However, when challenged about this, Mother told me that the nurse had not told her directly but indirectly.  Mother stated that there was a "bank nurse" who was called "Julie" but wanted to be known as "Pam."  She spoke on the telephone near to Mother whilst Mother was in the hospital bed.  Mother heard the nurse say,
"Hi Tony, how are the kids � if she's there I'll talk to her � she went on to say that he should have known better than to tell Angie anything � got her nephew to do something reckless like this � I'm at work tonight � I'll pop round later with a bottle of wine � I'm going to Egypt."

Mother is convinced that this nurse, who she met on one occasion, was talking to a man called Tony who is Mr. H's brother in law.  Mother is convinced that the nurse deliberately spoke near to Mother in bed in order that she could hear what she was saying.

Asked what made mother believe that this telephone call had anything to do with her accident Mother said,
"It was the nurse's persona."

When it was put to her that there was nothing in the conversation that was a direct link to Mr. H let alone her accident Mother said that she knew the nurse was linked to Mr. H,
"It was the fact that she looked at me with such hatred as she walked up the ward.  I knew that look very well."

Later on in her evidence, Mother told me that the Facebook entry is a "coded message" for her.

Mother told me that she could interpret these messages having spent years living with Mr. H and knowing of his "underhand dealings."
When asked whether Mother really believed that what she had pointed to was evidence of Mr. H's involvement she said,
"this is in itself evidence to me � it is not evidence in the normal sense of the word � not in a criminal way."

Mother told me that the "Facebook" page had been printed out by a man called PB who she had been seeing for a year and who she found out also had connections to Mr. H and was an associate of his.  "he had been working in Mr. H's camp."  She went on to say,
"He printed this off to make me convinced he was not in Mr. H's camp and was not a spy with him and consequently I severed all ties."

Asked about the nurse that Mother is convinced was an associate of Mr. H's who had deliberately tried to cause her harm Mother told me,
"She crushed the left side of my chest at the time it had a drain in it."  Mother said that this nurse Julie/Pam, had deliberately chosen to turn her onto her right side which she knew would cause her injury and caused her to slip into unconsciousness.  Mother said that the nurse, "did not like me for whatever reason."  However, despite mother believing that this nurse had deliberately set out to cause her harm and that she was an associate of Mr. H, she did not report this nurse or her actions to anyone.

Mother was asked about the effect on F of a failed assessment or rehabilitation attempt especially the effect of re-introducing her to contact  with her Mother.  Ms. W told me,
"if it doesn't work I'm pretty sure I will soon be forgotten."

Mother is prepared to leave the contact issue with her three other children in abeyance if F is returned to her care until F is settled.  Ms. W told me that she records all of her contacts with her children so, "I have some proof against his [Mr. H's] false allegations."  The maternal grandparents and Mr. B are aware that all contacts are recorded.

Mother makes these recordings on a Dictaphone.  I asked Mother whether she had the dictaphone at court with her on the day she was giving evidence.  She told me that she did.  I asked her to show it to me.  She removed it from her handbag which was in court although she told me she had not been recording the proceedings.  She told me that she had not recorded any  other professional only Dr. Adshead.

In terms of physical ability Mother told me that she can walk around the house, she can walk upstairs as long as she holds onto the right banister and described that given the weakness in her right side she has recovered as someone would who has suffered from a stroke.

Mr. B works in telesales and is out at work between 7.30 � 5pm.

Mother feels she could have F on her own in the house for up to two hours but would require assistance for any longer periods.  She would require someone with her at all times when out of the house with F.

In re-examination M was asked whether she felt she could work with the local authority.  Mother's answer was, "yes and no."  She qualified this by saying,
"I can work with people who are forward focussing � I don't want to be continually questioned and quizzed about the accident � it has no purpose or relevance.  I don't want to discuss the accident with the local authority in the future."

Mother told me that she would keep F out of the "battleground" between her and Mr. H.

I then heard from the social worker Ms. Chambers.

Ms. Chambers has filed three statements all of which I have read and she confirmed the truth of those statements.  She explained the delay in placing F which it serves no purpose to repeat but confirmed that the care pan of the local authority is  that the current foster carers will be approved as prospective adopters subject to the outcome of this application.  The matching panel is due to take place on 26th. February 2014.

Ms. Chambers told me of Mother,
"I absolutely commend her for the progress she has made physically but I still feel there are areas where Ms. W has not moved on � I still find it concerning that she believes Mr. H was the cause of the accident and professionals and nurses were a party to it � I think she has calmed down a lot and she can process things and not get angry and volatile but in her mind she is saying one thing but believes another."

Ms. Chambers is very concerned about the impact on F of the continuing battle between Mother and Mr. H regarding the three other children and believes this would have a negative impact on F.  She is also very concerned by Mr. B's decision not to have contact with his own children out of "principle" and did not consider the consequences for his own children of such a stance.  She said,
"I have concerns that he would not protect F and that he would take Ms. W's view.  I still feel he takes her view � probably more so � he probably feels she doesn't have a disorder."

Ms. Chambers told me that she would recommend a psychological assessment of Mr. B to consider his ability to understand Mother's personality disorder and ability to protect F from Mother's behaviour if required.

Ms. C told me that contact between F and Mother had been stopped because F had begun to be withdrawn after contact and the foster carer believed that F suffered from night terrors when she would wake up screaming connected to the contact.  Usually F had not been reported to have had any difficulty with her sleeping pattern other than these concerns in respect of contact.  Ms. Chambers told me that in her opinion F has a very secure attachment with her foster carers and she is extremely concerned about the effect on F of re-introducing Mother and destabilising this child's very secure placement.

Despite persistent but appropriate cross examination on behalf of Mother, Ms. Chambers told me that she fully understood the benefits to a child of being reunited with her birth family but in this case she considers the risks to F are too high in terms of causing emotional distress and instability to F, the prospects of success are too low for any further assessment to be warranted or any further delay to be caused before deciding on F's permanent placement.

Ms. Chambers accepted that Mother has always spoken to her in a calm and polite manner but commented,
"I've never had to challenge her."  Ms. Chambers is also extremely concerned by what she sees as inaccurate information having been given to the MP and Ms. James.  She was also concerned by Mr. B originally telling her that he had no children.

Ms. Chambers is strongly of the view that F should be adopted by her current carers and that there should be no further delay to this placement.  F is due to start pre-school in September and Ms. Chambers took the view that F needed to start that chapter in her life secure in the knowledge that she was settled in her home.

The last witness I heard from was the Children's Guardian Ms. Crossby who is an extremely experienced social worker and Children's Guardian.  Ms. Crossby was the Guardian in the care and placement order proceedings.

I have read her report with great care.  Ms. Crossby accepts that Ms. W has made changes but does not accept they are sufficient to cross the first stage.  She told me,
" I have noticed some changes in Ms. W � I visited her in early January � she is more open and maintained eye contact in a way she did not do so before and I was able to discuss things with her which previously would have been more difficult.  She has engaged in therapy which is to her very great credit and I have seen changes but what I have not seen are fundamental changes in her beliefs.  

Ms. Crossby remains concerned about Ms. W's continued suspicion of professionals and their involvement in her life.  She told me quite simply,
"I do not believe she has made sufficient changes for her to be able to work co-operatively with professionals for the benefit of F."

Ms. Crossby cited as examples, Mother's continued beliefs in relation to her accident and Mr. H and is very concerned that Mother believes her daughter T is somehow "against her".

Ms. Crossby does not doubt that Mother loves F and her three other children but believes that there is a degree to which Mother requires those relationships to be on her terms because of her borderline personality disorder.

Ms. Crossby, like Ms. Chambers is extremely worried about the effect on F of being re-introduced to Mother at this time.  She believes her emotional security will be destabilised and she is extremely concerned by any further delay for this little girl.

Asked about balancing the risks to F against the benefits of the chance of being placed with her birth mother, Ms. C told me,
"I've thought about this very carefully � I cannot say the risk to F is worth taking balanced against the likelihood of a successful outcome."

Ms. Crossby told me that she sees the start of pre-school as an important step in F's life and she is very concerned that the introductions needed and assessments required to progress Mother's application to revoke the placement order would have a detrimental effect on F at this time.  Ms. Crossby stated,
"I discuss this in my report � it is balancing not just a question of re-introducing F to Mother and Mr. B and TM and a new home � it is a question of going through a lengthy process of assessment which is likely to disrupt F's education, emotional well being and sense of security in her placement when she has been with these carers since she was four days old."

Ms. Crossby accepted that the carers are "robust" and would do their best to minimise any disruption for F during the introduction process but she still could not support any further delay or disruption for F.    In her view F will be "greatly affected" by the assessment process itself.

Ms. Crossby was concerned that the maternal grandparents had not considered in depth what support they could offer

Ms. Crossby was very concerned by what she saw as inaccurate information having been given to various agencies including Ms. James and the MP.  As Ms. Crossby said,
"What possible motive could the MP have for distorting the information in these circumstances."

Under cross examination Ms. Crossby emphasised that in her view Mother has not made sufficient changes in the really important areas of working with professionals, understanding the concerns of the professionals, putting the needs of her children before her own and being able to take advice , not just that with which she agrees but that which she does not.

Perhaps of key importance is Ms. Crossby's view that,
"The children would need to meet Mother's expectations and she could find it difficult to accept the children's development and sense of self � to be who they are, to express their disappointment, what they want � children can be confrontational � it doesn't mean they can do what they want but they need to be given respect that they have their own point of view and are able to express their opinions."

Ms. Crossby stated that Mother's comment that T "feigned affection" was concerning because it "denied the child's reality which fuels T's anger and confusion."  Ms. Crosby felt this was an example of Mother believing she is right and expecting the child to accept that she is right and when she does not criticising the child, "she's turning into her father." 
Ms. Crossby believes that Mother will find it enormously difficult to cope with the every day situation of "a number of people doing things with her child."  Ms. Crossby has grave doubts about the ability of Mother to work with a team of individuals for the foreseeable future including the grandparents, the cleaner, a nanny, Mr. B and social services and she sees this as a key issue.

Ms. Crossby told me that it is clear that Mr. B has accepted Mother's beliefs, he thinks very highly of her and he is not going to challenge her.  Either he really believes Mother's version of events or if he has doubts he is not prepared to voice them and colludes with mother.   Ms. Crossby is very concerned by Mr. Beer's attitude towards contact with his own children and the importance he placed on winning "the battle" rather than on the needs of his children.  Ms. Crossby's view is that Mr. B is a negative factor when assessing Mother's ability to change due to his absolute support and belief in Ms. W.

Ms. Crossby considers the grandfather is similar in his acceptance of Mother's views,  although she ventured to suggest that this was because he simply tried to "keep the peace."

Ms. Crossby considered that the only way properly to assess Mother would be a residential assessment which she considered would be extremely disruptive to F and not a course which she could recommend.  Ms. Crossby when pushed told me that she would put the chances of a successful rehabilitation at no more than 20% and that that was "generous."

Finally Ms. Crossby expressed a concern that Mother can be "an extremely engaging person" with a "tremendous spirit" and people can "feel for her" and want to get it "right for her."  Ms. Crossby is very concerned that the complex package of support that would be needed may address and focus on Mother's needs and F's needs would be overlooked.

After what I anticipated would be the close of evidence Mother asked that she be re-called to answer the comment made by Ms. Crossby that Mother would not accept a child's development or "sense of self."  Reluctantly I acceded to this request.  Mother then proceeded to describe situations when she was with Mr. H about how she had protected her children from Mr. H's parenting.  In my judgment she missed the point (to an extent) that Ms. Crossby had made and  continued her stance of describing in detail how concerned she is about her children being in Mr. H's care and what a destructive and frankly malign individual he is.  She tried to tell me how she had sought to protect T from Mr. H but did not address the issue of her ability to understand that the child may have a different point of view as a separate individual which she would have to accommodate.

I have set out above this summary of the evidence in some detail in order to show the depth and breadth of the forensic exercise at this the permission stage.  Given the difficulty of the case at the care proceedings stage and the fact that this application was possible due to F's non placement, I was determined that Mother had every opportunity to put her case as fully as possible, particularly in the light of the psychiatric evidence that Mother has improved mental health.  

At the end of the hearing at submission stage I specifically asked Mr. George to take instructions from Ms W to confirm that she is satisfied that all the evidence that she requires to be put before the court has been adduced and to ask if there is anything else she would wish to be said.  Mother confirmed through her Counsel that there was no such further evidence.  It therefore came as something of a surprise when on 14th. February 2014 I received through the court office a further four page document from Ms. W asking that it be placed in the bundle.  I sent this document to all the parties and extended the time for sending out the draft judgment from 17th. to 18th. February 2014 to allow any party wishing to make further representations to do so.  No party sought to make any further representations.  I have put this document at C82 � 85 of the bundle.  I will refer to it in due course.

The Law.

Turning to the law in relation to this application.  I am grateful to Mr. George of Counsel who has submitted written submissions on behalf of Mother.  I have used those submissions as a basis for directing myself on the relevant statute and case law but have obviously made significant amendments to those submissions.

I must have regard to section 24 Adoption and Children Act 2002 namely;
S24(1)(3) Adoption and Children Act 2002 [FCP-2013-308];
24 Revoking placement orders
(1) The court may revoke a placement order on the application of any person.
(2) But an application may not be made by a person other than the child or the local
Authority authorised by the order to place the child for adoption unless �
(a) the court has given leave to apply, and
(b) the child is not placed for adoption by the authority.
(3) The court cannot give leave under subsection (2)(a) unless satisfied that there has
been a change in circumstances since the order was made.
(4) If the court determines, on an application for an adoption order, not to make the
order, it may revoke any placement order in respect of the child.
(5) Where �	
(a) an application for the revocation of a placement order has been made and has
not been disposed of, and
(b) the child is not placed for adoption by the authority,
the child may not without the court's leave be placed for adoption under the order.
Mr. George has referred me to the following case law;

Case Law
Re P (a Child) (Adoption order.  Leave to oppose making of adoption order)  [2007] 2 FLR 1069[1]

 
Warwickshire County Council v M and L [2007] EWCA 1084 [2008] 1 FLR 1093.

 
Re SH-NS-H v Kingston Upon Hull CC [2008] EWCA Civ 493 

 
Re B-S (Children)(Adoption: Leave to oppose) [2013] 2 FCR 481

 
LRP (A child) (Care Proceedings: Placement Order [2013] EWHC 3974 (Fam)

 
Re B Care Proceedings: Appeal) [2013] UKSC 33

 
Re W (adoption order: leave to oppose); 3H adoption order: application for permission for leave to oppose) [2013] EWCA Civ 1177.

 
Re AW [2013] EWHC 2967

 

I remind myself of M v Warwickshire County Council [2007] EWCA Civ 1084.

"On establishment of a change in circumstances, a discretion arose to grant leave to apply for revocation of a placement order under section 24(3) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 in which, while the welfare of the chid was not paramount, the welfare of the child and the prospect of success should both be weighed.  In conducting the discretionary exercise under section 24(3) courts might usefully, in the vast majority of applications, borrow the language of the test generally applicable to permission to appeal in civil proceedings and as to whether the applicant would have a "real prospect of success would almost always include the requisite analysis of the welfare of the child, but the analysis of the welfare would not always be satisfactorily subsumed within an analysis of prospect."

Mr. George submits the following,
"The provisions of S 24 are analogous to S 47[2] and provide for a not dissimilar remedy.  The guidance and extensive review of the law by the Court of Appeal in re B-S is pertinent to applications under S.24 (3) as well as S 47(5)."

I respectfully agree with Mr. George who has referred me to the case of Re AW   when the distinction between the two was commented upon by Pauffley J.
"Ms Fottrell also contended that an application for leave to revoke the placement order and an application for leave to oppose the adoption are analogous. In order to succeed in relation to the former, and at a time before the child had been placed for adoption, a parent would have to demonstrate there had been a change of circumstances since the order was made. The court would then go on to consider whether or not to exercise its discretion and also whether the application has a real prospect of success (Re F (a Child) EWCA Civ 439). 
In relation to the latter, an application for leave to oppose the adoption, a parent would have to satisfy the court there has been a change of circumstances which is relevant or material to the question of whether or not leave should be granted. The change in circumstances must be of an nature and degree sufficient on the facts of the particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion; and the paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child throughout her life ( Re P (Adoption: Leave Provision) [2007] 2FLR 1069 ). "
I therefore consider the test required for the leave application.
The Application for leave involves a two stage process (see re B-S para 72 and 51 approving Re P).  This is a matter of judicial evaluation not mere discretion. 
"In our judgment, analysis of the statutory language in ss 1 and 47 of the 2002 Act leads to the conclusion that an application for leave to defend adoption proceedings under s 47(5) of the 2002 Act involves a two-stage process. First of all, the court has to be satisfied, on the facts of the case, that there has been a change in circumstances within s 47(7). If there has been no change in circumstances, that is the end of the matter, and the application fails. If, however, there has been a change in circumstances within s 47(7) then the door to the exercise of a judicial discretionevaluation to permit the parents to defend the adoption proceedings is opened, and the decision whether or not to grant leave is governed by s 1 of the 2002 Act. In other words, 'the paramount consideration of the court must be the child's welfare throughout his life'."

I use the term evaluation rather than discretion as that is what the Court of appeal urge me do to at paragraph 72 of their judgment.

Therefore the key distinction between the two applications is that the child's welfare is not the paramount consideration of the Court when considering s24 [See Warwickshire cc v M and L at [21/22] but F's welfare must inform the court's evaluation.

On behalf of Mother Mr. George submits,
"Whilst the welfare of the child is not paramount for an application under this section it is trite law that the welfare of the child is a very significant consideration and in this context it is the consideration throughout F's life."

Turning therefore to the "change of circumstances, what must Mother show? 

 The "change in circumstances" does not need to be significant  Re P at [29/30]  but needs to be of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given."

I remind myself of paragraph 68 of Re B S namely,
"We share McFarlane LJ's misgivings about Thorpe LJ's use of the phrase "exceptionally rare circumstances" as also about his use followed by the President in Re C [2-13] All ER (D) 235 (Apr) , of the word "Stringent" to define or describe the test to be applied on an application under section 47(5).  Both phrases are apt to mislead, with potentially serious adverse consequences.  In the light of Re B they convey quite the wrong message.  Neither in our judgment, any longer has any place in this context.  Their use in relation to section 47(5) should cease."

The test should not be set too high; Terms such as "Exceptionally rare circumstances" per Thorpe LJ re C[3] or "stringent" "are phrases apt to mislead"[4]
The test should not be set too high to prevent parents from bettering themselves [See Re P at [32]]
The test should not be set so as to discourage parents from preventing their child being adopted [See Re P at [32]];
I must bear in mind that when considering the "prospects of success" the question is not whether the child will be returned to the potential applicants care but of revoking the placement order. [NS-H v Kingston at [22]].  

Of note, it is conceded on behalf of Mother that whilst this case is referred to Mr. George submitted,
"Whilst good law on the facts of this case there seem to be only two outcomes for F.  Adoption or placement with her mother."

I have also considered the entirety of Re BS.  Whilst I am considering an application to revoke a Placement Order, I remind myself of what that order means for this child.  If it is not revoked F can be placed for adoption which is the most draconian of orders.  In particular I remind myself of paragraph 22 of Re BS namely,
"The language in Re B is striking.  Different words and phrases are used but the message is clear.  Orders contemplating non consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are a "very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do." Where no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interest", they are "the most extreme option" , a last resort when all else fails" to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short where nothing else will do."
I have also specifically considered paragraphs 32 � 34 of LRP (A child) (Care Proceedings:Placement Order.) per Pauffley J.

"The legal principles of application when the court is confronted with applications of this kind are well known,  Where possible, consistent with their welfare needs, children deserve an upbringing within their natural families (Re KD [1988] AC 806; Re W [1993] 2 FLR 625).  Care plans for adoption are "very extreme" only to be made when "necessary" for the protection of the children's interests, which means "nothing else will do," "when all else fails".  Adoption "should only be contemplated as a last resort" (Re B [2013] UKSC 33; Re P (a child) EWCA Civ 963; Re g (a child) EWCA Civ 965.)
Before I could consider placing LRP elsewhere than with her parents, or one of them, I must be sure there is no practical way of the authorities or other agencies providing the requisite assistance and support which would allow her to be cared for by at least one of their parents (Re B-S (Children) [2013] Civ 1146.)
I must analyse and consider all of the realistically available competing options and I must weigh in the associated positive and negative factors.  I have to be satisfied there is a sufficiency of evidence in relation to each proposal so as to undertake a global, holistic and multi-faceted evaluation of LRP's welfare."

Before considering placing F elsewhere other than with one or both of her parents, the court has to be sure there was no practical way of the authorities or other agencies providing the assistance which would allow her to be cared for by at least one of her parents see Re LRP.

Analysis and discussion.

Therefore the first issue I must address is whether there has been a change of circumstances of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given.

The factors relied upon by mother to argue that there has been such a change in circumstances are as follows;
Improvement in Ms. W's mental health

 
Improvement in Ms. W's physical abilities.

 
The suitability of Ms. W's accommodation.

 
Ms. W's relationship with Mr. B

 
Ms. W's support network including her improved relationship with her parents.

 
The fact that TM now resides with her.

 
At the time of her application Ms. W relied upon the fact hat she has regular contact with her children.  This is no longer the case.

 

The key factor in this list is whether and to what degree Mother's mental health has improved.  This is central to this case because one of the key reasons for making the care and placement orders was that I took the view that Mother would not be able to co-operate with the complex and long term package of support that would be required for her to be able to care for F due to her physical disabilities.  It was not the provision of such a package that was the issue.  It was Mother's ability to work with many different professionals in the long term for the benefit of Freya.  
When first looking at the written evidence of Ms. C and Dr. Adshead there seemed to be evidence of sufficient change in Mother's psychological functioning.  I had accepted in the care proceedings that Mother has a treatable borderline personality disorder as diagnosed by Dr. Adshead.  There is no dispute that Mother has undergone therapy with Ms. C (the details of which I have set out above in the evidence section), which Dr. Adshead considers to have been "appropriate."  Ms. C told me that in her professional opinion Mother has made marked improvements in the way she can consider and react to daily life challenges.  On the face of it, there is a reasonable argument that Mother would meet the first stage of the test.

However, as I heard the evidence, in particular from Ms. W herself, I became increasingly concerned that on key issues Mother has made either no or insufficient improvement or progress.

I was looking for Mother's ability to consider that there can be issues and problems in life which may be of her own making and for which she must take responsibility and for her ability to consider the views of others when they disagree with her.  Both of these issues are important in considering whether Mother would be able to co-operate with a team of professionals and carers for the benefit of F.
Whilst Ms. W objects to the focus on her car accident and her theory of the cause of it, in my judgment it remains relevant.  Ms. W to this day cannot accept that this dreadful accident, which caused her such physical injury, could have been due to any negligence on her part.  She remains steadfast in her belief that she was the victim of a murderous conspiracy orchestrated by Mr. H.  Whilst I accept I have not heard from Mr. H and I have not conducted satellite litigation to consider the causes of the accident, (and I have not experienced Mr. H as Mother has) the evidence upon which Mother relies to justify her beliefs is frankly bizarre, incredible and does not bear scrutiny.  Mother cannot explain how Mr. H could have hired a person to get into a car with another individual (who may or may not have known of the plan)  in order that they deliberately smash into Ms. W with the express motive of killing her.  Mother in my judgment can produce no evidence that begins to prove that theory.  At one point Mother told me that  nurse (Pam/Julie) had "told her" of Mr. H's involvement.  In fact, when the questioned about this it is clear the nurse had done no such thing.  The totality of the evidence against the nurse was that she had looked at Mother, "with hatred in her eyes" and Mother had overheard a conversation between the nurse and another individual who mother had assumed knew Mr. H.  Mother also gave an account of this nurse deliberately trying to harm her in hospital by turning her onto her right side (as opposed to her left) and yet Mother made no such complaint against the nurse.

Mother cannot consider that she may be mistaken about this.  Her settled view is that she is the victim in all of this and yet despite this adversity has battled on.  None of this is her "fault".  She understands the conspiracy and despite explaining it, others do not believe her.  This simply adds to the injustice that she suffers.  All of this remains Mother's settled view and contrary to Ms. C's opinion, Mother does not seem to have progressed in this view at all.

I was very concerned by what has been described as "dishonesty" by the local authority in the information provided by Mother to various professional agencies.  I place no weight on the example of the DVLA because it seems to me that Mother may have given accurate information immediately after her discharge from hospital.  However, I am concerned about the information Mother is said to have given Ms. James and to the MP which I have set out above.  Mr. George made careful submissions about the weight that could be attached to this evidence.  He reminded me that I have not heard from Ms. James or the MP.  I do not know whether contemporaneous notes were made and how the documents before the court came into existence.  Whilst I have taken account of all of these very well made submissions, it seems to me incredible that both individuals "misunderstood" Mother to such a degree.  Whilst I have not heard from Ms. James, I heard from Ms. Smith who had spoken to Ms. James and specifically confirmed that the account given by Mother in the assessment was accurately recorded.  She felt that Mother had not been honest with her.  Similarly I find it incredible that the MP would have misunderstood so comprehensively the information Mother had given him.  For him to be concerned that TM and F would be "out on the street" when neither were living with Mother suggests to me that Mother had not been honest with them.  Mr. George asks me to accept that even if I take the view that it is more probable than not that mother gave inaccurate information to these professionals, and I do,  I should effectively give myself the "Lucas" direction.  These interviews were conducted at a time when mother was due to be evicted from her home and she was very concerned about being re-housed.  Mr. George asks me to consider that Mother may have put a particular gloss on her family situation in order to secure housing and that a general concern about her inability to work with professionals cannot be drawn from this.  Firstly, that is not mother's case.  These are not admitted lies.  Once again Mother's case is that she is the victim of others misunderstanding her.  She is blameless.  Secondly, if she did give inaccurate information it suggests a degree of manipulation of professionals which is a concern that I have with this mother.  For a package of support to work in order that Mother can care for F, Mother must be able to work in a straight forward, transparent and honest way.  This example raises real concerns in this area.

I was concerned by the late document submitted by mother, without permission, on 14th. February, but which I have accepted into evidence and have considered.  In that document Mother has a heading, "The issue of me not being child focused."  Mother commences that paragraph with the following sentence, "I do not feel that this issue was explored fully within the hearing."  I have to say I found this a disappointing submission.  In my judgment Mother was given every opportunity to put her case.  The oral evidence lasted over three days and Mother was in the witness box for over a day.  She was able to give very full (at times rambling) answers without interruption.  This seems to be yet another example of Mother believing that if her case is not accepted it is because of yet another injustice done to her namely that there was some flaw in the process, rather than because of the merits of the case and the legal tests I must apply.  In my judgment, Mother's ability to be child focused was the central issue in the case and great care was taken by all concerned, not least her able advocate, to ensure this issue was before the court.  

I was concerned by Mother's behaviour in respect of taping Dr. Adshead.  Firstly Mother should not have taped Dr. Adshead without her consent and permission.  Had she asked Dr. Adshead, permission would have been given.  I  find it incredible that Mother had "forgotten" that she had a tape of Dr. Adshead's interview whilst she was giving evidence and that it had emerged only after Dr. Adshead was released from the court.  That put Dr. Adshead in a very difficult position which she should not have been put in.  The recording, even on her own evidence, does not evidence Mother's account.  Mother's justification for making the recording is that she wanted to play it to Ms. C to discuss her therapeutic and treatment needs and yet Mother has not played this recording to Ms. C and frankly could give no credible reason why not.  I am concerned that Mother had the recording equipment at court.  I can place little weight on Mother's denial that it has not been used to tape court proceedings.  She should not have brought it into court.  I am concerned that Mother considers it appropriate to tape all of her contacts with her children.  I respectfully agree with Ms. Crossby that it tends to show that mother views all contacts as part of an ongoing battle with Mr. H rather than as simply enjoying contact with the children.

This degree of suspiciousness concerns me greatly.  In my judgment it is evidence of Mother's difficulty in functioning without believing that others will misinterpret her and that she requires "proof" of what is said in many different situations. 

 Ms. C told me of the improvements in Mother's ability to consider the viewpoints of others.  There is no doubt that Mother has successfully constructed a life around her which is supportive and more positive than before.  However, when I consider Mother's life, she is surrounded by individuals who support her view of the world and her situation.

Mother's relationship with Mr. B is clearly a change for Mother and has contributed to her feeling of well being and happiness.  The evidence before me is that these two individuals are committed to each other and will be married in May 2014.  I have no doubt that Mr. B loves and cares for Mother and is genuinely committed to her at the present time.  However, my concern about this relationship is that Mr. B's devotion to Mother compromises his ability to consider important matters dispassionately and he finds it very difficult to take a view contrary to Ms. W.  There is no clearer example of this than the issue of contact with his own children.  It seems to me entirely reasonable that Mr. B's ex wife (I shall refer to her a Mrs. B) raised concerns about the suitability of Ms. W having contact with her two boys once she had learnt that Ms. W's 5 children had been removed from her care.  Frankly, had Mrs. B not raised such concerns one would have had to question her own child protection abilities.  Mr. B should have been open with Mrs. B about this from early on in his relationship with Ms. W and certainly once Mrs. B had learnt of this, understood and tried to assuage her concerns.  Whilst Ms. W tried to portray herself as a reasonable mediator and negotiator in this scenario, it was clear from her evidence that she was dictating or at least assisting Mr. B in drafting e mails to Mrs. B.  Ms. W's evidence in respect of Mrs. B was concerning, seeing her as a deeply unreasonable person.  I note Mother's description of Mrs. B in the transcript produced by mother (at C75),
"well� it was very similar to mine in that his ex-wife is very much controlling and manipulative unfortunately shows a lot of characteristics the same as Mr.H."
In fact Mrs. B had allowed generous and unrestricted contact between Mr. B and the boys up until she knew of Ms. W's past.  However, Ms. W sought to paint the difficulty as lying squarely with Mrs. B.

I respectfully agree with Ms. Crossby that there is a worrying resonance between the way Mother has conducted her "battle" with Mr. H and the way Mr. B has conducted himself with Mrs. B.  I was extremely concerned that Mr. B did not have contact with his own children "out of principle" due to Mrs. B's concerns about Ms. W.  If this was really Mr. B's independent decision, it is extremely concerning.  He clearly prioritised his relationship with and the feelings for Ms. W above the needs of his own children.  I find it hard to think of a less child centred response to his own son than to tell him that he cannot see them because their mother does not like Ms. W.

Mr. B aligned himself to the sensibilities of Ms. W and took his son into the centre of  what I can only describe as the "battle" between Ms. W, Mr. B with Mrs. B.  Mr. B should have continued to put his sons first.  He should have maintained direct contact whilst working with Mrs. B to assuage her concerns.  Whatever the influence was of Ms. W in this situation, if positive as she would ask me to believe, it was ineffectual.  However, given her own evidence of involvement, it appears to have been entirely unhelpful and counter productive.  I do not accept that Ms. W tried to assist Mr. B in seeing the problem from Mrs. B's point of view (which was understandable) and encouraging a child centred solution.

If Mr. B cannot put the needs of his own sons above his relationship with Ms. W I have no confidence that he will put the needs of F above those of Ms. W should a situation arise when he is concerned about Ms. W's behaviour or mental health.  

I was also struck by Mr. B's complete acceptance of Mother's case that Mr. H had caused her accident.  There seemed to be no doubt in his mind that Mother's account is credible and true despite such a belief (on the evidence Mother has told me) simply not bearing scrutiny.

I am concerned that Mr. B does not understand the gravity of Mother's condition and her associated problems.  Whilst I believe him to be a well meaning individual, he struck me as almost naive and accepted so much of what Mother tells him at face value including the reasons why the three children were originally removed from Mother's care.  I do not find that Mr. B is a negative factor per se.  In many ways he is a positive factor for Mother as an individual in her own right and clearly gives her emotional and physical support.  However, I do not view him as a positive or protective factor for F.  I have seen no evidence that Mr. B would disagree with Ms. W and quite the reverse, he will support her to the detriment of himself and his own children.  Mr. B is a not a factor which assists Mother in meeting stage 1 of the permission two stage test.  Nor is Mr. B evidence that Mother has progressed in having better relationships with those around her.  Mr. B has become mother's main supporter and champion and is entirely aligned to her view of the world and the challenges they both face.  Her rigidity of view is supported and not challenged or in any way threatened by Mr. B.

Similarly Mother places weight on her improved relationship with her own mother.  In my previous judgment, I set out in detail my concerns about Mother's own view of her mother, namely that she suffered from a severe personality disorder.  Mother has never accepted that any conflict in that relationship was due to any unreasonable behaviour on her own part.  Mother has told me that her relationship with her mother has improved and certainly PGF told me that there was less tension at Christmas when Mother went to stay with her parents.  I did not hear from the MGM and therefore do not know her views on these matters.  However, in my judgment it is interesting to note that one of the main areas of tension between Mother and MGM has resolved namely TM has returned to Mother's care.  I am also unclear exactly how much contact Mother has with her parents and certainly I was concerned that given the importance of this hearing, there had not been a family meeting to discuss the practical support the grandparents would be able to give.  I was unconvinced by Mother's evidence that she has had extensive discussions with her mother on the telephone which her father seemed unaware of.  Firstly, if true it raises concerns about the communication between the grandparents but it seems unlikely that MGF would have come to court without having had those discussions with his wife.  (This was not put to MGF.) Moreover, it is unlikely that Mother would not have had those discussions with he father who historically she has always been closer to, even if I were to accept this improved relationship with MGM.

I was very concerned about Mother's attitude towards contact with her own children.  Contact has broken down and again Mother finds it very difficult to accept that this is in any part due to her own behaviour.  I respectfully agree with the social work evidence that the relationship between Mother and T is concerning.  Her description of T as "feigning affection" suggests that Mother is attributing rather sophisticated and adult motives to T when she is a child caught up in a very difficult situation between two parents.  Mother lacks an ability to accept that the difficult relationship between her and the three children could be due (at least in part) to her own parenting or behaviour towards the children.  Again, it is the fault of Mr. H.  The difficulties between her and T are because "T is becoming like her father."  Despite her therapy, Ms. W could not refrain from making an inappropriate comment to T about Mr. H which T reported back to her father and contact has since been suspended.  Conflict resolution on this issue has not improved at all since the care proceedings.

I respectfully agree with the submissions made on behalf of F through Mr. Trueman as follows,
"The Guardian does not see the right sort of change in Ms W's mental health, whether in nature or degree, to give her any confidence at all in Ms W being able to function any differently regarding her children's welfare. There is no movement in realisation of harm to a child caught in the fall out of such vehement dispute between Ms W and Mr H. So, although the therapist may say there has been change and progress in the therapeutic setting, there is no evidence of improvement in Ms W's ability to prioritise the needs of her children over her beliefs and her dispute with Mr H. She will go on recording contact and meetings with professionals, she continues to lie about events and background facts and she now has her camp believing in what she says, because she gives a consistent account of the car accident for example, to Mr B.
Both Mr B and Ms W put the principle of them being right before the need to maintain good regular contact with their respective children. Ms W could have resumed contact with her children (as could MGPs) if a payment of �250 had been made to Mr H. It is wrong for Mr H to withhold contact but a pragmatic approach, which would best serve the children's needs, would be to pay the money and get contact going again. Mr B did not see his children for some months due to their mother Mrs. B, being unhappy about a lack of information about his new partner who had had 5 children removed from her care. It was reasonable for Mrs. B to say that the new partner should not be present, until she knew more, or Mr B should have contact in the absence of Ms W. Neither Mr B nor Ms W put their children's needs above their own."

I accept the opinion of Dr. Adshead that Mother has made some improvements but that she still has some way to go.  I also accept that Mother can present as calm and less rigid in situations where she feels supported and not threatened but that she may present very differently when under stress.  I am very concerned about the risk of relapse for mother if put under stress and accept that attempting to care for a defiant three year old may be such a trigger.

Turning to Mother's accommodation,  whilst I accept Mother has suitable accommodation for F to return to her care, this was not the reason for F not being returned to Mother and does not constitute a change.  It is not a relevant change for the purposes of this test.

Therefore for these reasons I do not accept that Mother has made sufficient change in the key areas needed.  Whilst I accept that she has undergone therapy and she is leading a more positive and a happier life, her ability to take responsibility for any problems in her life and to accept a different viewpoint from her own does not seem to have progressed, if at all, to a sufficient degree.

Therefore I do not consider that there have been sufficient changes to Mother's mental health to constitute a change to satisfy the first stage of the permission test.  I therefore do not find that there has been a change of circumstances of a nature and degree sufficient to open the door to a consideration of whether leave to apply should be given.

However, if I am wrong about that I have considered the prospects for success under the second stage of the test.

In my judgment within the care proceedings I wrote the following,
"The key issue for the court therefore is whether there is any package of support available which will protect F from the risk of emotional harm and from physical harm and neglect if placed in Mother's care.
Having read all the evidence in the bundles and heard the oral evidence of the witnesses as detailed above, I am of the view that there is no package of support available which will safeguard Fs emotional and physical well being whilst remaining in Mother's care.
I do not accept that Mother can meet F's emotional and physical needs on a consistent basis in the long term and I am satisfied that the risk of emotional harm and physical harm and neglect is unacceptably high.  I accept that Mother would not deliberately cause F physical harm but her inability rationally to accept advice on practical issues would put F at risk.  If Mother stopped co-operating with professionals and withdrew from professional help F would be at risk of neglect.  I am particularly concerned about F's emotional well being when Mother became distressed, anxious or angry.  Mother's behaviour during contact with her other three children showed that she can react angrily and with complete disregard for her children when her emotions overwhelm her.  That happened within the restricted environment of supervised contact with MGF supervising, a man for whom Mother has great affection and who is very sympathetic towards her.  The risks to F are much higher with Mother as a full time carer.  I find these risks cannot be managed within the birth family."

In my judgment this remains the key issue.  Given that I am not satisfied that there has been sufficient change in Mother's ability to co-operate with professionals for all the reasons I have given, my judgment about this key issue remains the same.  Mother's personality disorder would "get in the way" of mother's ability to co-operate.  
For all the reasons set out above I do not accept that Mother has made sufficient change in the key area of being able to co-operate with professionals who may have to put forward a different view to her own and focus on F's needs rather than her needs.  I accept Ms. Crossby's concerns that the package of support may tend to focus on Mother's needs rather than on F's.

I rely on the evidence of Dr. Adshead that even in the areas of improvement, there remains a risk of relapse which although is hard to quantify, is real and may be triggered by the stress of caring for F.  In my judgment this risk is too high given the very severe problems mother has encountered in the past and the harm that F would suffer as a result of a failed rehabilitation attempt or indeed by an intensive period of assessment which ultimately proved unsuccessful.

Even if I am wrong about that, in order to test out whether Mother's ability to co-operate has significantly improved, all parties are agreed that if permission to apply to revoke the placement order were granted there would then need to be a long period of assessment.  Although there has not been a recent detailed assessment of what practical support would be needed of Mother's ability to care for F, it is accepted on behalf of Mother that there would have to be a comprehensive package of support to assist Mother due to her physical difficulties.  Mother has put forward a package of support including her parents, Mr. B, her cleaner and a nanny/helper.  Clearly there would also have to be a high degree of local authority monitoring (certainly at the beginning) given the concerns of the past.  This assessment would need to involve F and in fact the children's Guardian is of the view that only a residential assessment would provide the sufficient degree of monitoring and assessment required properly to consider Mother's ability to care for F.  Ms. Crossby is strongly opposed to any such assessment or any disruption to F's life at this stage.

I must consider the welfare arguments at this second stage as part of the assessment of "prospects of success."

The Children's Guardian asks me to consider the following factors and argues that if appropriate weight is placed on them, I will be driven to find that welfare considerations will render any prospects of success unrealistic.  

a.	F has been in the care of her prospective adopters since a few days after she was born.
b.	Those carers are ready to adopt her now.
c.	To uproot her from those carers would be potentially harmful, especially with poor prospects of successful placement elsewhere.
d.	F has a pressing need for permanency now and has already waited 3 years for this opportunity.
e.	Ms W has not shown an improvement in her understanding of the needs of children. 
f.	Mother has not moved on in her preoccupation with Mr H. That preoccupation blocks her focus on her children's welfare.
g.	Mother has recorded professionals' meetings and contact with her children thereby showing a highly suspicious aspect to her thinking and not one which has a child welfare focus. She is intent on the "battle" and will do what she needs to win it.
h.	Mother has told different stories to different professionals to secure what she wants. This is not a good omen for a sound or positive working relationship with professionals.
i.	Mother has an unrealistic view of the care of F and no clear plan for how this would work, who would contribute what and when. 
j.	No real thought has been given to how to deal with a 3 year old child who may not want to do as Mother says. Mother's response to children who do not do her bidding is not child centred. Her comment that T "feigns affection" for her, comes to mind, as does her refusal to pay what the Father says amounts to arrears of maintenance which leads to a 6 month gap in contact and Mr B's refusal to have contact without Ms W present.
k.	Mother says that she expects that she and F would have to make adjustments. F is 3, and unlikely to be of a mind to make adjustments.
l.	F's reaction to contact with mother was negative- it is said she had night terrors, linked to her contact. In other words, that the night terrors occurred during the time she was having contact with her mother but when contact stopped, so did the night terrors. The Guardian believes it would be harmful to reintroduce F to her mother.
m.	Mother's contact with her children who live with their Father is difficult and to bring F into this troubled contact arena would put her at risk of emotional harm.
n.	The only way to test if Mother could look after F would be to try it out. That experiment would likely to lead to emotional harm to F who would likely be distressed and confused as to what was happening. She has not seen Ms W since April 2013 when the goodbye visit took place. She would not have positive memories in light of the night terrors surrounding contact. It is submitted that such an experiment would be potentially abusive.
o.	There is no one who can stop Ms W saying inappropriate things to F. Mr B does not challenge her and he is the only person who would be there, when he is not at work and were he prepared to challenge her.
p.	Limited weight should be given to the evidence of the therapist, with a realisation that she gave a therapist's view; positive but perhaps only half the story. What she says is not reflected in Mother's suspicious actions in lying to professionals, recording professionals and her children. Dr Adshead said these are indicative of the personality disorder in action. The therapist has to be positive but her focus is Ms W and should be taken as such.
q.	F will not be equipped to deal with a Mother who scans people for criticism. Her mother will not be equipped to deal with the criticism and rejection a young child can present.

In my judgment these points are well made.  Key to those points is that save for the first four days, F has been in care all her life.  She has been the subject of litigation for most of her life.  Her future has therefore always been uncertain.  Happily, F's experience of care is of one settled placement with carers to whom she has become securely attached.  She has not had contact with Ms. W since April 2013.  For mother to succeed at this stage, F would remain the subject of litigation for at least a further 6 months and would also be part of ongoing assessments, the resolution of which is likely to require at least one further contested final hearing.  I accept the process of assessment is likely to unsettle and disrupt F's emotional security.  I cannot countenance this disruption, when I have assessed the prospects of success to be so low.  In my judgment, such an assessment would cause F emotional harm and distress.  She is fortunate that her current carers have been assessed as being appropriate to adopt her and therefore if this application is refused, subject to the matching panel, there is no uncertainty about her future placement.  However, I wish to make clear that my judgment in this matter would not have been different if F would have to move on to a different adoptive placement and her current carers were not putting themselves forward.  

In my judgment it is not in F's welfare further to delay a permanent placement with her current carers given the inordinate delay she has already suffered through these proceedings and challenges to orders already made.  Throughout my deliberations, I have kept in the forefront of my mind the draconian nature of adoption, (and I bear in mind the guidance set out above) and that the result for F if the placement order is not revoked is a plan of adoption.  At every stage I must consider whether adoption is the only realistic option.  It is important to note that Mother's case has been argued on the basis that there are only two options available at this stage namely, rehabilitation to Mother or adoption.  It has not been argued by Mother or any other party, that there is any other family member who can now care, or that I should at this stage consider long term fostering with direct contact between F and Mother.  Although this has not been argued, in accordance with Re B-S I have considered whether there are any other realistic options to adoption in the light of my findings in respect of Mother.

The current foster carers have put themselves forward as adopters.  They are therefore willing to care for F for the rest of her minority and beyond although I do not know what their view would be about caring for F as long term foster carers.  I have considered whether long term foster care would be in F's best interests.  I have already emphasised the point that F has been in care all her life thus far.  Only an adoption order will give her the permanence and stability that the local authority and Children's Guardian argue F requires.  I respectfully agree.  It cannot be in F's best interests to consider revoking the Placement Order to leave her as a "looked after child" for the rest of her minority.  Furthermore, it is clear that Mother will never accept any other carer for F.  She believes her place is with her.  In my judgment there would be a real risk of harm to F of being subjected to further litigation throughout her minority if she does not have the permanence of an adoption order either through repeated applications to revoke the care order or through applications for contact.  In my judgment direct contact between F and Mother would bring with it the risks of emotional harm through F being caught up in the conflict between Mother and the local authority.  I also bear in mind the evidence of the local authority that contact between F and Mother was stopped due to the foster carer reporting F suffering form "night terrors" associated with contact.   In my judgment the risks of F's placement  and emotional stability to such an arrangement are unacceptably high.  Therefore, although not specifically asked to do so, I have considered whether there are any other realistic options to adoption in this matter.  Sadly, in my judgment, there are not.

Therefore , in my judgment  adoption is the only option available to F at this stage given all of the circumstances of this case.  In my judgment this interference in F and Ms. W's family life is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the risks to F if Mother's application is acceded to and litigation continues.

For all of the reasons set out above I do not grant Ms. W permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order.  I do not find the first stage of the test for permission is satisfied but even if I am wrong about that, in my judgment the prospects of Ms. W succeeding in her application to revoke the placement order are so low that it is not in F's welfare for there to be any further assessment or any further delay in her placement being secured.  Therefore Mother's application for permission to apply to revoke the Placement Order is refused.

I come to this decision with a heavy heart.  I like so many others, commend Mother for the improvements she has made to her life.  Her physical rehabilitation is little short of remarkable and she has been committed to therapy.  I hope that she will continue with her therapy as she has told me that she will, whatever the outcome of the case and that if she and Mr. B marry in May I hope they will find happiness in the long term.  

I wish to thank and commend all of the advocates for their enormous assistance in this case.  In particular I wish to thank Mr. George for the great care and sensitivity with which he has represented Ms. W, for which he has the court's appreciation.

JUDGE BRASSE: 

I have before me applications for care orders.  Those applications are dated 3rd April 2013.  The children with whom I am concerned are NC referred to as N, who was born on 12th August 2006, so he is 7 years and 5 months of age; and MC referred to as M, who was born on 8th February 2012, so she is 1 year and 11 months of age.  The Local Authority also issued, on the second day of this hearing, applications for placement orders in respect of both of those children.  However, in the light of evidence that was given by the child and adolescent psychiatrist and the family finder, to which I shall refer in due course, the applications for placement orders are no longer pursued and thus I will give permission to the Local Authority to withdraw those applications.  

 

The parties to these proceedings are as follows.  The applicants are the London Borough of Wandsworth.  The first respondent is LN , who is the mother, and I shall call her "mother" henceforth.  The second respondent is EC, who is the father, and I shall call him "father" henceforth.  The third and fourth respondents are the children themselves, who act by their children's Guardian, Linda Reed.    

 



THE PARTIES' POSITIONS  

The Local Authority say to me that the threshold criteria are met and that their assessments show that the children cannot be safely returned to the parents or to either of them, either together or separately.  The parents' case is that they are separate, and the mother would say that they have been so since after May 2012.  The father would say that in fact an intimate relationship of some sort continued until late 2012.  Either way, they say to me that they are separate.  So, say the Local Authority, I should make a final care order in respect of both of the children on a plan to place the children with long-term foster carers, with some contact to the parents once they are placed long term, and the contact that would be proposed is three times a year between each parent and N, and four times a year between each parent and M.  The Local Authority thus say that I should find that the children cannot be safely rehabilitated to either parent; that the only family member who puts herself forward is the maternal grandmother in an African country, but, say the Local Authority to me, the known risks in such a placement are too great to take and thus, they say, there is no option but to make a care order and, as I have already said, a care order on a plan to place them in long-term foster care and that they are no longer seeking an adoptive placement.  The Local Authority say that they are committed to keeping the children together and, in the light of the family finding evidence that an adoptive placement for both children together was, in the view of the family finder, remote, the Local Authority have properly, in my view, not pursued any placement applications but seek a care order on a plan for long-term fostering.  

 

Insofar as the parents are concerned, their position is that they both accept that the threshold criteria are made out.  They make a number of concessions, and although each of them had filed evidence seeking the return of the children to their care, both parents at the outset of this hearing informed the court that neither the mother nor the father were putting themselves forward any longer as carers for the children.  The mother and the father have individually told the court that they each recognised that they cannot care for the children and each now supports the application of the maternal grandmother.  Each opposes the making of a full care order on plans to place the children in long-term foster care.  Each asks me to accept that the children should be placed together with the maternal grandmother in an African country.  

 

At the outset they were each seeking that I make such an order - i.e. to place the children with the grandmother in an African country - at the end of this hearing.  However, as the case has unfolded, their respective positions have changed in that they each ask the court to adjourn the final decision to allow for further and full assessment of the maternal grandmother, with a view, they hope, to a successful outcome and then placement of the children with the maternal grandmother at the adjourned hearing.  In any event, each opposes reduction in contact pending placement.  

 

The children's Guardian's position is that she supports the Local Authority application in the making of full care orders.  She submits that the threshold criteria are met.  She had supported applications for care orders on a plan to place the children together for adoption, and thus placement orders.  However, having heard the evidence and following that the Local Authority were no longer pursuing placement applications, she now supports the making of care orders on a plan to place the children for long-term fostering and together.  She vigorously opposes any adjournment for further assessment of the maternal grandmother and considers that there is sufficient evidence before the court now to conclude that the risks in placement with the maternal grandmother are simply too great to take.  

 

I have read the bundle of documents which has been filed with the court, together with those documents which have been produced during the hearing.  I�have heard the oral evidence of Dr. Butler, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist; Ms. Hall, the family finder; Ms. Onya, the allocated social worker; Ms. Coker(?), an independent social worker who gave evidence by videolink from Nigeria; the maternal grandmother who gave evidence by Skype and videolinks from an African country; the mother and the father, and I heard from Ms.�Reed, the children's Guardian.  I have paid also considerable attention to the professional evidence which has been filed in this case but where the authors have not been required to give oral evidence.  In particular, I have paid attention to the parenting assessments of both parents by the Woking Close Family Centre, and the report of Mr. Dowsett, a consultant clinical psychologist, who assessed the father.  He was to have assessed the mother too but she did not attend his appointment.  I have read and heard the submissions by counsel for each of the parties, and I am very grateful to all of the counsel who have been involved for the careful and considered way in which they have conducted this case.  

 

THE PROCEEDINGS   

The applications for care orders were issued on 3rd April 2013.  There was a contested application on 9th May 2013 in the Family Proceedings Court.  The Local Authority sought interim care orders on a plan to remove the children from the mother and to place the children with paternal aunts.  In the event, interim care orders were granted and the children were placed with the aunts, who are T and AC.  In fact I think there are three paternal aunts, all of whom live together in a well known area of South London.  The parents were to have three times a week contact.  Directions were given for assessments, to include parenting assessment of the parents, and for there to be a child and adolescent psychiatrist to assess the needs of the children.  The case was transferred to the PRFD.  In the event, the Local Authority appealed the making of the contact orders and directions because no submissions had in fact been made to the Family Proceedings Court and those directions and contact orders were made without the benefit of hearing any arguments from any of the parties.  The case was, accordingly, transferred to the Principal Registry.  

 

The appeal was in fact compromised, and the matter came before me for a case management hearing on 13th June.  Directions were then given for assessments and for timetabling.  The matter came back before the court on 12th July 2013 for a further case management hearing, and further directions were given, including for there to be a full special guardianship order-type assessment of the paternal and maternal grandmothers.  These were to include translations into a  European Language.  The paternal grandmother in fact in July came to the UK and stayed with the paternal aunts.  

 

Sadly, the placement with the paternal aunts ended in July, and the aunts said that they could no longer put themselves forward to care for the children.  Indeed, they asked for the children to be removed from their care as soon as possible.  All of the paternal family and the maternal family apparently had a joint meeting and together they all concluded that the person who should be put forward to care for the children was the maternal grandmother, and that they were all then supporting the maternal grandmother in an African country.  

 

On 15th August 2013 the children were moved to H, who is a new (as it has turned out) short-term foster carer, a single white parent, and the children have remained with her ever since.  Indeed, she has made it clear that although she cannot put herself forward to care for the children long term, she will keep the children with her until they are moved to their long-term placement, wherever that might be, and she will assist with that move.  

 

The matter then came before the court on 26th September for an IRH, and this final hearing was listed.  On that date the court found that the threshold criteria were indeed made out and satisfied on the basis of concessions that had been made by the parents, primarily that there was domestic violence as between them.  Directions then were given for the assessment of the maternal grandmother in an African country, and contact was ordered to be weekly to each parent to M and fortnightly to each parent to N.  

 

On 25th November the matter came back before me urgently because the independent social worker, Ms. Coker, unfortunately was unable to obtain a visa to enter An African country and to fully assess the maternal grandmother.  In that event, directions were given that if she were unable to visit an African country, then she could conduct the assessment as best she could by Skype and telephone.  

 

THE LAW  

Before a court can consider whether or not to make a public law order, the court must be satisfied that the section 31 threshold criteria are made out that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm attributable to a lack of reasonable parental care if an order were not made.  The relevant date in this case is 4th April 2013 when protective measures were taken.  As I have already said, on 26th September 2013 the court found that the threshold criteria were made out on the parents' acceptance of the domestic violence between them.  There is now a composite document at A78, and para.9 sets out (between A79 and 83) the numerous findings that were sought by the Local Authority and the many concessions that were made by the parents.  

 

The parents concede that there has been a very significant and extensive history of domestic violence between them and, as part of that, that the mother has made rape allegations against the father.  She has made those allegations to the police and within these proceedings, and then withdrawn them.  For his part, the father has always denied the allegations of rape, and no evidence has been adduced in this court in support of those allegations and nobody has sought for me to make any findings in relation to them, and I do not.  However, both parents have accepted that they have both struck the other, and that the father was convicted of an assault on the mother on 21st September 2009, for which he was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.  He has also perpetrated criminal damage on the mother's property.  There have been numerous referrals to the police in relation to domestic violence.  Further, it is accepted that during an argument the mother seriously injured the father's finger with an implement in May 2012.  

 

Notwithstanding the parents' bail conditions not to contact each other, the parents have flouted the same, and the mother has allowed the father back into the home and to have contact with the children.  The mother would say that she did not continue the relationship with the father in the summer of 2012 and after May 2012.  The father, however, says that an intimate relationship did continue and he stayed with the mother on a number of occasions in August 2012 and then in the autumn.  What is clear is that at a time post February 2012 when the Family Recovery Project were working with the mother to improve her parenting skills, and when all agencies made it clear that they considered the father to be a risk and that there should be no contact, the mother allowed the father to have extensive contact with the children, including overnight in Christmas 2012.  Thus, the parents accepted that they maintained a significant deception and were dishonest with Social Services and with the police.  These matters are contained, as I have said, in the composite document.  

 

It seems to me important to note in this judgment that the Family Recovery Project had no less than 420 contacts with the mother over 13 months, and thought that there was no contact between the parents post May 2012, such was the level of the parents' deceit and ability to hide matters from the authorities.  In the event, the Family Recovery Project considered that, despite intensive work with the mother, they were unable to effect any change.  The mother also acknowledges a degree of neglect of the children, particularly of N, in missing medical appointments and some poor school attendance.  

 

The Local Authority did seek further findings in relation to mother's lack of emotional warmth and ability to meet the children's, and especially N's needs.  Clearly there are sufficient concessions to satisfy the threshold criteria as I have in the composite document.  Where it is important, with regard to welfare issues, to return to any of the other matters which were set out in the first document of the Local Authority, I will do so.  But suffice it to say that on the concessions that have now been made in the composite document, I find that the threshold criteria are satisfied, and that therefore should be read alongside this document.  

 

When considering the law, the welfare of N and M is of course my paramount consideration and I must bear in mind the section 1(3) welfare checklist.  I have been referred by the parties, and particularly the parents' counsel, to the case of Re B-S [2013] EWCA (Civ) 1146, and the Court of Appeal guidance.  That was an adoption case.  The President, in his judgment at paras.22 and 23, repeated the language that had been used in the case of Re B [2013] UKSC 33 by the Supreme Court, and repeated that the language was striking.  Where orders are sought contemplating non-consensual adoption, placement orders and adoption orders, they are a very extreme thing, a last resort, only to be made where nothing else will do, where no other course was possible in the child's interests.  Behind all this is the well-established principle derived from section 1(5) of the Children Act in conjunction with section 1(3)(g).  The court should adopt the least interventionist approach.  Although B-S was an adoption case, I remind myself of the Court of Appeal decision of W (a child) v Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council [2013] EWCA (Civ) 1127 and the judgment of Ryder LJ at para.94 where he said that it was: 

 

"... not the place to analyse the extensive body of jurisprudence which now exists on the approach of the court to the decision as to which order is necessary and proportionate.  ..... It is necessary, however, to recollect that the Supreme Court in [Re B] emphasised that care orders are a last resort.  Whether the context is an adoptive care plan or not, Lord Neuberger's conclusion on the correct legal test for the making of an order was unambiguous:  

"... it is clear that the judge cannot properly decide that a care order should be made in such circumstances unless the order is proportionate bearing in mind the requirements of article 8.  

76.  ... given that the Judge concluded that the section 31(2) threshold was crossed, he should only have made a care order if he had been satisfied that it was necessary to do so in order to protect the interests of the child.  By 'necessary', I mean... 'where nothing else will do'." 

Thus the principle applies not only to care plans for adoption but to those for permanent removal from the family which includes long-term fostering.  Ms.�Nicholls of counsel, on behalf of the father, referred me also to the similar terms of McFarlane LJ in the case of Re G [2013] (Civ) 965.  Further, para.77 of Re B says that section 1(3)(g) of the Children Act states that the court must consider all options, which carries with it the clear implication that the most extreme option should only be adopted if others would not be in the child's interests.  In Re B-S the President emphasised at para.34 that there must be proper evidence from the Local Authority and the children's Guardian.  The evidence must address all the options which are realistically possible and must contain an analysis of the arguments for and against each option.

 

Thus, I must analyse each available option, assess the evidence for and against, make a global, holistic and multi-faceted evaluation of the child's welfare, which takes into account all the negatives and positives, pros and cons, before reaching a decision.  

 

When I consider any findings of fact, I remind myself that the Local Authority are the applicants.  The burden of proof lies with them.  The standard is the ordinary civil standard - the balance of probabilities; is the fact in issue more likely than not?  Further, when considering the credibility of each of the parents, I have regard to the guidance in R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 to the effect that a conclusion that a person is lying or telling the truth about one thing does not mean that he or she is lying or telling the truth about another thing.  A witness may lie for a number of reasons:  through panic, through fear, through distress, or misplaced loyalty.  

 

THE BACKGROUND  

The father was born in 1983.  He is now therefore nearly 31 years of age.  He is from an African country.  His parents live in an African country and have been married for 40 years.  His father is half European.  He has three sisters, the paternal aunts, who live together in the house in a well known area in south London.  He also has an older brother in an African country and he has one in Canada.  His account is that he had a good and safe childhood.  His father has good employment.  The father reports that he came to the UK in 1999.  He completed the equivalent of GCSEs in an African country.  He says that he came to the UK to study, that he did a foundation GNVQ course in engineering, and then started a two-year AVC business course.  He completed one year of that course.  It is not clear to me that he ever completed the course entirely.  Certainly he changed courses, as he did not know what he wanted to do.  He says that his family are disappointed in the way things have turned out, and particularly in his relationship with the mother, which was poor.  

 

As to the mother, there has been, it seems to me, a considerable lack of clarity in the accounts which have been given to different professionals, even at one point as to her date of birth.  What now seems to be accepted is that she was born in 1988 in an African country and so she is 25 years of age.  She has two older sisters in an African country, an adult brother who is a year younger than herself and, in addition, she has two younger teenage brothers who are called H and G, who still live with her mother (the maternal grandmother), and she has a young 10-year-old sister, also called A, the same name as the maternal grandmother, who also lives with the maternal grandmother.  She has never lived together with her youngest sister.  Her mother is half from an African country and half half European.  

 

The mother herself came to the UK in 2002 when she was about 14 years of age, and she came together with her older sister A.  A would then have been about 19 years of age.  They went to an area of north west England where there were some cousins.  The mother said in her evidence to me that she only stayed with them for a couple of months and that they did not want her and her sister, and therefore she and her sister were placed in foster care.  Her sister was placed there too, and therefore she must have been claimed that she was somewhat younger in order to be fostered.  

 

It is very unclear why the mother and A were sent to the UK.  It was the end of the war in the African country.  However, the brothers all stayed with the family in an African country.  The mother has said to professionals that she believes she came as an asylum seeker, but the maternal grandmother when giving her evidence said that it was the maternal grandfather's idea that they should come here to study.  It is also very unclear to me why, when they could not stay with relatives in north west England, they were not brought home to An African country.  The maternal grandmother says that she went to pick them up when they were in foster care, and that A had stress and so she brought her back, but L (that is this mother) stayed and that she therefore has remained isolated from her family and in the UK ever since. The maternal grandmother accepted in her evidence that it had not been a good idea, in retrospect, to have sent L to the UK and that things had not gone well for L.  

 

The mother describes herself as having been a difficult and argumentative child and adolescent.  The maternal grandmother gave evidence of the mother having difficult behaviour.  She described the mother, that is L, as growing up like a rebel - those are her words.  The maternal grandmother admitted that she had given L a slap when she was difficult, but she said she could manage L's behaviour, but that the maternal grandfather would give in to L and that she would get what she wanted.  

 

However, there was a completely different account given to Dr. Butler when she interviewed the mother.  The mother now either denies that she said them at all, or that Dr. Butler has wrongly recorded them.  However, I accept Dr. Butler's evidence on this, and therefore I read from G162 at para.69.  Asked about her childhood and what had happened when she was living in an African country, the mother said to Dr. Butler as follows:

 

"I asked her if her father would hit her and she said that he would.  She said she would get a good beating in Africa.  'They beat you with everything', and she laughed.  She said her mother would give her a slap.  She described herself as a very difficult child, horrible.  She said she was wild and would never listen, and said 'I'm paying for my sins now', and she laughed again."  

Further, the mother has told professionals, including Dr. Butler, that her father was violent towards her mother.  She described an incident when her father burnt her mother's wedding dress, and that he would beat her mother, and that she felt sorry for her mother.  The mother, L, now says that her parents did have arguments but it was not that bad and that there were only a couple of incidents and, again, that these matters have not been properly recorded.  

 

The maternal grandmother, for her part, denied that there was any domestic violence between herself and the maternal grandfather when the children were young.  She says there has been some violence but it has been in the latter years, and so she and the maternal grandfather have separated, although they now get on well enough that he does assist with some of the child care.  

 

Thus, there is no clear picture of the mother's childhood or early adolescence, although it is clear that she was left in the end all alone and in the UK.  After leaving care she spent some time in north west England and in London and between the two places.  In 2004, she met the father, E.  She was 15 or 16.  They met through a mutual friend.  In 2005 the two of them were watching a TV programme about health matters.  They both underwent testing and were both found to have a serious illness.  It would seem as though the father has taken this information calmly.  He says to me that he takes his medication daily, that he sees the doctors regularly, and that he is well.  The mother is also on daily medication, although there is evidence that at times she has forgotten to take her tablets.  She has described getting very tired, having headaches and fevers and hallucinations.  Her medication has been changed, which she says is better.  It is clear to me that the mother's physical health and diagnosis of the serious illness, has, not surprisingly, caused her significant emotional difficulties, and Dr. Butler considered that the mother was not accessing emotional support to help her to deal with it.  

 

N was born in August 2006.  The first reported domestic violence between the parents was the week before his birth.  The parents were said to be returning home from a late night out.  The father was said to be drunk, and an argument ensued in which it was said that the father slapped the mother many times to the face.  There were then several further incidents reported to the police during N's first two years of life.  Reports were made of the parents hitting, kicking, punching, and of the use of implements to include using an ironing board and a knife.  The police assessed the risk of serious injury between the two parents as high.  They made a referral therefore to Social Services and there was a section 37 investigation, which was concluded on 14th May 2007, and I�am reading from A3 of the chronology.  What was said at the end of the section 47 investigation is as follows:

 

"The assessment concluded that the mother acted appropriately by calling the police, but it is extremely concerning that she needed to protect herself with a knife.  Mr. C's attack on her was violent.  N could have easily been hurt during the incident.  Ms. N needs to seriously think about her reasons for remaining in the relationship with the father.  The father has assaulted her a number of times."  

	One has to remember that that was May 2007, and I am now dealing with a case in 2014.  

The mother was asked about the domestic violence between them by Dr. Butler.  She said the following at G160, para.57:

 

"I asked about the domestic violence, and her foot started to tap.  She said it started when she was pregnant with N and at its worst she said he cut her face and body with a knife, and spent seven months in jail.  She then told me again that there was no respect whatsoever between them, and they would be kicking and slapping and punching each other.  She said she started hitting back but denied that she would ever hit him first.  She talked about how shocked he had been the first time she fought back."  

The father described the violence to Dr. Butler and he described it as follows at G151, paras.11 to 13:

 

"I asked when the difficulties started, and he said it was a year after they started seeing each other.  The arguing increased.  He agreed that there had been a number of misunderstandings between each other which were usually over small things.  He said that sometimes he did not even know why it started.  He wondered how it developed into violence and he said that the arguments just increased in their level of anger and it was just the next step.  He told me that they were both hitting each other.  I asked how it had been at the worst, and he said it was really bad.  He described how there were weapons used, and he then listed a knife, a kettle, and he repeated the word 'knife' again in a disconnected way.  I wondered if he would give me an example, and he described how they came home from a party one night and both had had a drink and were arguing.  Ms. N went to a neighbour's house to cool down, but when she came back she was angry.  She picked up a knife and slashed his cheek, and he showed me the scar.  He said 'I did the same to her', but his knife was not so sharp and did not cut her.  He said, however, 'The blood made me lose it'."  

The parents both agree that N would have witnessed the violence, and I�have to add that it is just fortunate that he was not in fact caught in between the two, because had he been, he would have been at risk of physical injury himself.  But the parents admit that he would have witnessed the violence.  The father said at G151, para.15:

 

"I asked if N had seen the violence, and he said 'He did see some of it'.  I wondered how he reacted, and he said 'He wanted us to stop', and he would say to his parents, 'Why are you shouting?' and would try to break them up.  He said 'I think it did affect him emotionally'.  He described N as 'getting confused because we were supposed to be taking care of each other'." 

The mother in evidence agreed that N witnessed domestic violence.  She said he would see her being hit and he would see the bruises afterwards.  "He wanted us to stop, and he would try to break us up".  It is to be remembered that he was a very small boy indeed.  One can only imagine just how frightened and scared he would have been that the people who were meant to be taking responsibility and looking after him were acting in this way one to the other.  

 

Due to the police involvement and N's presence during these domestic violence incidents, there were referrals to Social Services.  In January 2008 it was alleged that the father attacked the mother with a knife.  There were bail conditions not to contact the mother.  In July 2008 the father smashed the front windows of the mother's home with a brick.  On 19th August 2008, N was made the subject of a child protection plan, category physical abuse.  In September 2008 the father went to an African country for a few months to look for work, and there was a period of calm.  The mother had housing difficulties and so she was temporarily accommodated.  In June 2009 she was rehoused in secure accommodation.  The father returned to the UK, and by August 2009 it seems that Social Services had closed the case.  They said that N appeared to be thriving.  But later that month the father was convicted of ABH on the mother, and he received nine months' imprisonment.  On his release in February 2010 he resumed contact with the mother.  There was a further core assessment about the mother and the child.  The parents said they worked towards parenting and they would work on the domestic violence issues.  However, on 25th February 2011 the father was convicted of causing criminal damage against the mother's property and he was sentenced to 42 days' imprisonment.  There were further police notifications in March and August.  

 

On 18th August 2011 there was a multi-agency risk assessment conference, and it was concluded that this was a high risk case.  There was a further section 47 investigation.  The mother said she did not want a relationship with the father but he continued to contact her.  The investigation - that is the second section 47 investigation - concluded that the mother was stuck in a cycle of abuse and although she says she does not want to be with the father, she does see him and she lets him into her home.  The mother was now pregnant with M and so the conclusion was that N and the unborn baby were at risk of significant harm.  On 13th October 2011 N was made the subject of a child protection plan with a category of emotional and physical abuse.  There was a decision then taken that there ought to be a legal planning meeting.  On 7th December 2011 the unborn baby was also made the subject of a child protection plan.  It was evident that the domestic violence was continuing.  The school were concerned about N's punctuality and the fact that he was not able to make friends.  On 8th February 2012 M was born, and a referral was made to the Family Recovery Project.  (I pause for a moment because when looking at this chronology, the amount of work and referrals and assistance given by Social Services, one has to wonder why perhaps legal planning meetings and these proceedings were not taken earlier.  I will go back to the chronology.)  So M was born.  The referral was made to the Family Recovery Project because of the concerns over domestic violence.  The Family Recovery Project is a multi-agency support service.  On 6th March 2012 M was made the subject of a child protection plan.  In May 2012 the school were very concerned about N's behaviour.  

 

The father was not engaging with professionals.  On 9th May 2012 the mother was arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm on the father for causing an injury with a knife to his finger.  She was bailed.  In June 2013 that charge was not proceeded with.  The mother then made a counter-allegation that the father had raped her, and she was arrested and bailed not to contact the mother and not to go near her estate and to report to the police station.  I make it clear that the mother made the allegations of rape first to the police and then in these proceedings, but she later withdrew the allegations to the police, and she has not proceeded with those allegations within these proceedings and thus I make no findings.  But it is, it seems to me, part of the overall background of allegations that were being made.  The mother was offered temporary accommodation as it was deemed not safe for her to stay at her home address.  However, she refused that in the end, and she returned to her family home, against advice.  The father was referred for a programme to address the domestic violence and anger management.  

 

Throughout the summer of 2012 until the early part of 2013, the Family Recovery Project were involved with the family in an intensive way, as I have already set out.  Assistance was given to the mother with routines with the baby and for routines with N.  N was referred to Kids Company for therapeutic support at school.  In December 2012 both children were to remain subject to child protection plans, and at that point the current social worker, Ms.�Onya was allocated.  There were numerous concerns reported about the mother's care of the children.  It was said that the mother found it difficult to put her children's needs before her own.  She would cite physical illness and fatigue for reasons why she could not care for them in terms of not only their routine but making sure they had regular meals and taking them out for activities.  She said that she suffered panic attacks, and she felt unable to provide the basic care.  

 

The mother now says in oral evidence that although she does not accept all of the particular matters which are alleged, she does accept - and she said to me - that she was struggling to cope, such, it seems, that she would struggle to keep to any sort of routine, despite the intensive help of the Family Recovery Project.  The school reported that N was lethargic, tired, that he was falling asleep in class, that he was often hungry.  He told his therapist that his mother was often too ill and too tired to make him food.  There were concerns he was underweight.  Often he attended school inappropriately dressed and smelly.  

 

By early 2013 the social worker observed, and I accept her evidence on this, that the mother was often impatient and angry with both of the children.  N would look wary of talking to his mother, and that he then would come across as challenging.  The mother would speak negatively of N and there was sometimes a lack of warmth in her reaction and interaction with both children.  N was reported by the school to often be fretful and unsettled and refusing to work without one-to-one support.  He could be easily angered and would hide under chairs and tables.  He could be destructive, throwing and pushing furniture around.  His emotions would fluctuate.  He often presented as confused and guarded, and he worried about his mother's health and her wellbeing.  Further, there was some non-school attendance and some lateness.  The mother would say that this was due to her illness.  Thus, there were serious concerns as to N's social and emotional wellbeing, and lack of educational attainment.  

 

During the work of the Family Recovery Project, it is right to say that at times the mother showed she could meet the children's needs, but she was not able to do so consistently.  By March 2013, the Family Recovery Project concluded that, despite their intensive support by a range of professionals, they were not able to effect change in the mother.  There were only limited improvements, and these were not sustained, and so they took a decision to end their involvement.  

 

Given the deterioration in the mother's parenting of the children, the Local Authority decided to bring these proceedings, and they applied, as I have already set out, to the court to remove the children to foster care and then to assess the parents under the auspices of care proceedings.  

 

Although the professionals who were involved with the family - i.e. the police, Social Services, the Family Recovery Project - thought that post-May 2012 there had been no contact between the parents, it became clear that the parents had maintained a significant deception.  The father says that he had no contact with his children between May and August 2012 but that after that he renewed something of a relationship with the mother and stayed regularly at her home and saw the children, and would sleep with the mother, and this continued to the end of November 2012, and that he had the children to stay over Christmas.  In the second week of January 2013 he said they had an argument over an accusation over him having a girlfriend, and then the contact ended.  

 

The mother has denied that there had been any contact post May 2012, although she accepted that he did have the children overnight over Christmas 2012, and she agrees that she allowed him to take them early in January 2013.  The mother admits being dishonest to the professionals involved but she does not accept that the father was spending time with her and the children in the autumn of 2012.  It is difficult to be clear.  Both parents have accepted that they have deceived the professionals involved and been dishonest.  I find it is more likely than not that the father saw far more of the children and the mother after August 2012 than the mother will admit to, and that he regularly stayed over at her home.  Although the mother has denied this in her evidence to me and in her written evidence, I note that at the contested hearing at the Family Proceedings Court on 9th May 2013, she said as follows, at B48 to 49.  This is at the May hearing in the Family Proceedings Court.  In answer to cross-examination by the Local Authority, the mother admitted she did not tell the Family Recovery Project workers that she was allowing the children to see their father.  She told N not to say anything to the workers if he wanted to see his father.  She agreed that it was unfair to put N in that position and that it was emotionally harmful for him and potentially upsetting for him to be in that kind of conflict.  

 

Thus, at the time when both parents were subject to bail conditions not to contact each other and when the mother was alleging that the father had raped her, she was allowing contact to take place and, as I find, the parents were seeing far more of each other than the mother will admit to, and N was involved in that deception, as the mother admitted on oath in the Family Proceedings Court.  

 

THE ASSESSMENTS  

Both parents underwent assessments which were conducted by the Woking Close Family Centre.  As to the father, this was conducted between 4th July 2013 and 8th August 2013.  Unfortunately, he missed a number of sessions, including contact with the children.  The Woking Close Family Centre concluded that he was unable to understand the children's needs, that he was inconsistent in the process, and had not undertaken planning in relation to housing and finances.  The father is unemployed and he has no fixed abode.  He has been sleeping at different friends' homes.  He could offer, said the Woking Close Centre, short-term basic care, and when he was present in the home with the mother, then N was better cared for, but he was not able to provide this long term.  Woking Close were also very concerned that the parents might still be in a relationship together.  Thus, they could not recommend placement with the father.  Further, although he spoke of the domestic violence and that it was not good for the children to witness this, he could not expand on this area and he did not demonstrate a significant insight into these concerns.  He was, they said, at a pre-contemplation stage.  

 

As to the mother, they conducted an assessment of her between 9th July 2013 and 19th August 2013.  There was concern that the mother had struggled to meet her own needs, both in the past and currently.  She was not able to organise her finances.  She was at risk of eviction for rent arrears.  She was still adjusting to her health issues, and struggling to manage her day-to-day health needs.  They did not consider that she was able to be mindful of her children's basic and more complex needs and that she struggled to meet her own needs.  She had difficulty understanding the children's developmental stages.  Her relationship with them appeared to be damaged by the neglectful care they had received from her in the past.  N related to the mother in an anxious and disorganised way.  Her missing contact sessions and her difficulties in engaging in the assessment raise questions about her overall commitment.  As to her ability to provide a safe and stable home for the children, they said as follows at G297:

 

"Historically the mother has found prioritising the children's basic care needs as difficult, especially prior to the removal of the children.  N's attendance and punctuality at school became poor and he was reported to be hungry, tired and sad at school.  N was severely underweight.  The mother did not appropriately address his health needs as she missed two community dietician appointments, and N's weight did not improve until he was placed in the care of his paternal aunts.  The mother has minimised the concerns about her neglectful care during this assessment time.  She denied that N went to school with dirty clothes, with the exception of one occasion, and she denied having parties or causing noise or sending N to school tired.  The mother said that N's school and the children's social worker were against her, and would exaggerate issues to put her in a poor light.  She said that she had problems with some of the neighbours in the past and that they had made malicious allegations about her to the housing association.  The mother has received support in this area in the past, intensive support from the Family Recovery Project, but she still did not address or fully appreciate the concerns of a number of professionals involved in the work."  

	So they concluded, at para.84, G298:

"If the children were placed back in her care at this point, we believe a similar pattern of neglectful care would occur, and we do not think she is able to meet their needs at this time.  She has unmet emotional needs herself and so a difficulty to meet the children's needs."  

The project were concerned that the mother had come to the UK when she was only 14, that she had had two children at a very young age, that she had found herself to be unwell at the age of 17, that she had been in a violent relationship, and that she had had, thus, no nurturing or emotional support from 13 onwards.  I have to say that the court too is sympathetic with the mother for all of those reasons.  They found that the mother's lifestyle was generally chaotic and disorganised, and that she was thus a highly vulnerable and very fragile young woman.  She tended to minimise the Local Authority's concerns of her neglect of her children.  Thus, they could not recommend that the children be placed with her.  They did, however, identify a number of areas where the mother could benefit from support and focused work.  They said that she could have work in the future to deal with domestic violence and future relationships; that there could be attachment-based interventions with her; that she could have help with budgeting and with a positive parenting group, and therapeutic support for some of the traumatic experiences she has had in her past.  All of these apparently could be provided at Woking Close Family Centre.  It is, much too late, sadly, for these children, as the mother has already recognised.  But I say this to her:  she is young, and I would hope that she will take up these recommendations and suggestions for her own sake, for the future.  These suggestions are set out at G300 to 301 of the bundle.  I am not going to read them out, but it does seem to me that this was a very carefully considered report and that it recognised the vulnerability of this young woman, and I only hope that she will seek to be referred for the sort of assistance to assist her in the future.  

 

The next assessment was that of Mr. John Dowsett, the consultant psychologist.  He was to have assessed both parents, but the mother did not attend, and so he only assessed the father.  He stated that the father acknowledged a lengthy violent relationship with the mother - G322:

 

"The father acknowledged that there has been a long and continuing pattern of conflict and at times violence in their relationship.  He suggested that they had both been violent to each other on a number of occasions, although he had never reported the mother's violence to the police.  He was asked to be specific about his violence towards the mother, and he referred to having slapped her in the face and having punched her on at least one occasion.  He also referred to a particular incident where a knife was involved.  His account of this was that the mother was the one who picked up the knife and went for him.  She cut him on the cheek, and he showed me the scar.  He acknowledged that he tried to retaliate by picking up a different knife, and he scratched her.  He also seemed to have punched and kicked her on this occasion, and he ended up in prison." 

	The father acknowledged that N had been exposed to the domestic violence at G325:

"The father acknowledged that N was exposed to some incidents of violence.  These included the parents both shouting and fighting with each other.  I noted that he tended to speak about these in a rather detached manner and did not show any obvious evidence of distress, sadness or guilt.  He did, however, acknowledge that 'I feel we let him down.  We didn't think about him being present.  We didn't really know how it would affect him'."  

	At G327 he said:

"The father said that when he was arguing with the mother, N would often say 'Stop shouting'.  He feels that N may be hurt and confused by what he witnessed but did not appear to have any more in depth or empathetic understanding of what N might have experienced."  

	He concluded therefore that the father was in a state of denial, G330:

"However, he [the father] would appear to be in a state of denial about the full extent of his behaviours towards the mother.  I have also observed him to be detached from his emotions and in particular was unable to readily experience any remorse, sadness or guilt about what N had been exposed to.  Similarly, I felt he lacked an adequate, empathetic and emotional connection with N, such that he could really think and talk about N's experiences and how they have impacted on him."   

I have to say that when I heard the father give his evidence, my view concurs with that of Mr. Dowsett.  I too thought that he lacked any real empathy or emotional connection when he was speaking about N, and that he was detached from his emotions, and that he did not show full remorse.  

 

As to the risks for the future, Mr. Dowsett says as follows at 332:

 

"There are significant risks of the parents living or being together as a couple, and there is little reason to suppose that the relationship would be any less free of conflict in the future.  It is a volatile relationship with a lot of history involving violence, and it is clear it is would not be safe for the children to grow up in.  Clearly there is a risk of future conflict and domestic violence in any further relationships with partners as to the father.  I think that there would certainly be some potential risk of the father and the mother having to deal directly with contact.  There has been a risk in the past of the parents being deceitful, colluding with each other and going against the wishes of the Local Authority.  There was little in the father's presentation to be reassured that this might not happen again in the future."  

The third assessment was that of Dr. Butler, the consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, who reported to the court in July 2013.  She was asked to carry out psychiatric assessments of both children, to consider their attachments with their parents and to consider their needs in terms of long-term places.  As to N, in her opinion, he has got significantly distorted attachment development and evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder.  His unresolved trauma is in relation to the domestic violence he witnessed and his very complicated feelings about his relationship with his parents.  As to M, she considered that she shows signs of developmental maladaptive attachment strategies within her relationship, particularly with her mother.  However, the doctor thought in July that having been with her aunt since March she had had consistent and nurturing care, and that that had allowed some of her maladaptive strategies to be contained.  N, said the doctor, had experienced frightening, intrusive and neglectful parenting from infancy.  Any emotional and/or behavioural difficulties that he displays are related to that parenting that he had received.  N not only experienced significant levels of domestic violence between his parents from infancy, but he had also had to deal with a mother who is extremely chaotic and often depressed.  She describes this further at G198, para.18:

 

"He [N] was neglected to the point that at times no meals were provided for the children, alternating with other times when the mother was intrusively negative towards him.  He also had to deal with her possible use of drugs [I have no evidence about that] and alcohol as well as there being potentially risky adults around the family home.  I have no doubt that at times the mother has also been positive in her interactions with N, but even when she has been positive and happy with the children, it is in a highly aroused and quite stressful manner.  So I think for N his relationship with his mother is characterised by very high levels of arousal, trying to track what she is doing and what is going to happen next, and her unpredictability, all of which have made it very difficult for him." 

She said that N presents as a child who is hyperaroused and always vigilant to the adults around him, waiting for a situation to change.  His attachment strategies are such that he demands a lot, particularly from the adults that he feels are most risky.  She said of his time with his father that he will have experienced his dad as much calmer and mindful and nurturing.  However, at times when he became extremely violent, that would have been very frightening for N.  She says at para.22:

 

"I think at times in the past N has been very depressed.  Certainly the school have described him as tearful and withdrawn.  He would come unkempt, often coming late or not being picked up in the afternoon.  The fact that he bit himself and talked about stabbing himself in the head indicates he has very low levels of self-worth and he was overwhelmed in his anxiety around his relationship, particularly with his mother.  N struggles within his relationship with peers because of that very high level of arousal and agitation.  He will be bossy and controlling and other children will not tolerate it." 

When the doctor herself spoke to N about the violence, he spoke of knives on the floor, and he became increasingly physically aroused, walking around in circles.  The doctor did observe the father as being quiet and persistent and calm in a contact with the children, in contrast with the mother being more unpredictable.  

 

M, says the doctor, has experienced emotional abuse and physical neglect since her birth, largely in the care of her mother, who was depressed and withdrawn at times, and at other times angry and unpredictable.  M is extremely cut off emotionally in her relationship with her mother, and she is a compliant child who does not make a lot of demands.  The descriptions from the Family Recovery Project workers is of the mother either not having M in her mind or, when she does, being angry with her.  

 

Dr. Butler concluded that neither parent was in a position to meet the children's needs.  At G215 she says at para.4.1:

 

"In relation to the mother, she is an extremely vulnerable young woman who continues to live a very chaotic lifestyle, as evidence by her inability to even get to contact on time.  A lot of intensive work has been done with her and it has not produced any significant change.  In my opinion, the changes she needs to make will not be done within the children's developmental time frame."  

	In relation to the father:

"He shows a lot of very positive skills with the children but I think in terms of his own needs he is still vulnerable at the moment.  I do not think he would be in a position to manage the children by himself.  He needs to have therapeutic support around the violence in the relationship.  He also needs ongoing support about his physical and emotional health in relation to his ill health.  He needs to improve his self-esteem in terms of getting his education and work life back in balance."  

She thus recommended therefore that there be alternative care.  At the time of her written assessment, assessments of the grandmothers in an African country were being conducted.  Her concern then was that there would be a need for N to have therapeutic support, and it was not clear that this was available in an African country.  She said in her report that if the assessments were not positive, then she would support long-term fostering of the children together.  

 

Since Dr. Butler's report, the children have had to move from the paternal aunts where they had been settled, and that was a further loss for them.  They have been placed with a foster carer in mid-August.  Considerable evidence has been filed from the foster carer as to the difficulties in N's behaviour, particularly his waking at night, and there has been evidence from the school and the therapist there. The assessment of the maternal grandmother had, unfortunately, to be completed by Skype interviews and telephone, and was therefore necessarily not as full or complete as a full direct assessment would have been.  Nevertheless it was positive.  The Local Authority had also filed their care plans initially to place the children for adoption.  

 

So it was in the context of this new information since her report that Dr. Butler gave her oral evidence before this court, and she brought her recommendations up to date.  She said that, given the children's Guardian's conversation with N that he did not want to go to an African country, and the disturbing behaviour that there had been whilst he was with the foster carer, she was concerned about a placement with the maternal grandmother.  She therefore considered that it was in the children's best interests to be placed together and in the UK.  N needs certainty in terms of his placement.  He needs to remain with his sister and have psycho therapeutic input for at least a year whilst he is in placement.  He has high levels of agitation and distress, particularly at night.  His symptoms indicate traumatic memories for him and a level of fear, and without therapy he will be left open to a risk of ongoing anxiety, and that would jeopardise his placement.  The children, she said, should be placed together as the descriptions are of a positive relationship.  If they were separated, there would be further trauma and loss for both of them.  She said that N has said he does not want to go to an African country.  If he went, he would lose his entire context, and she said that would be traumatic for him.  Her recommendation, thus, was for long-term fostering in the UK.  She said it would allow for the same education system, though there was an unknown of course as to where the children would move.  But N would have the benefit of ongoing contact with his parents.  She said that N will struggle at times, and so he needs carers who can manage his behaviour.  They need to be experienced parents who have worked with children with difficulties.  He has a lot of symptoms and they will need to contain him and not feel personally attacked.  She thought that contact should be reduced once he is in placement to six times a year for each parent, and that that should take place during the holidays.  She was firmly against adoption, as N, she says, has a sense of his family and his identity within his family, and that the children should be together.  Therefore she supported long-term fostering.  

 

Dr. Butler was concerned that N was largely unknown to an African country, or an African country to him, and that he had only been there once on holiday, and that the quality of his relationship with his maternal grandmother was untested.  She said that the family have survived trauma due to the war, and if you add to that a traumatised child, that could lead to increased difficulties.  She said that N will be angry and he can be aggressive, and that would be challenging for any carer.  She accepted that the children will have to move anyway because they cannot stay with their current carers and will have to move, on her recommendation, but she would hope that, with careful matching and a good care package and support, that could be done.  Her concern with an African country was that N did not know the language and there will be many changes for him in terms of environment and education, and so his behaviour could escalate.  The court should attach weight to his wishes not to go.  

 

For M, she conceded that there would be advantages to her to being placed with her family.  She has some mild attachment difficulties but she responds well and the risk factors are less for her.  There would be equal risk - was Dr.�Butler's view - in her case in terms of her ability to attach, whether it be to foster carers or to her maternal grandmother.  So it follows that if it were M alone and if the maternal grandmother could provide appropriate care, then in the long run it would be better for M to be placed with her family and with her maternal grandmother in an African country.  But she needs to be with N, and the doctor was not confident that his needs could be met in an African country.  That was untested.  So she said that the maternal grandmother would, thus, need to come to the UK for assessment if it were to be tested.  She said that if that happened and the maternal grandmother came to the UK, then N would guess what it was about and he would need to be told.  He would need to be given pictorial information about an African country, about schools there, and bedrooms, and the home, so that he could, in the doctor's view, start to build a picture in his mind.  This so far had not happened.  She also thought that it was possible that the paternal aunts and the foster carer could assist him with this and that it would be useful in those circumstances if the maternal aunt were to come to the UK as well.  

 

She said in answer to cross-examination by Ms. Nicholls on behalf of the father, that she was not against the maternal grandmother, as it were, per se, it was just that in her view the maternal grandmother was untested.  However, her overall evidence was that she supported long-term foster placement in this country.  

 

THE OTHER ASSESSMENTS AND THE ORAL EVIDENCE  

There were further assessments of course conducted by the social worker, Ms.�Onya, who knows the children very well indeed, and the very experienced children's Guardian, Ms. Reed.  In addition to that, the independent social worker, Ms. Coker, assessed the maternal grandmother.  I also heard from the family finder, Ms. Hall, and from both the parents.   

 

Unfortunately, I found both the father and the mother to be unsatisfactory witnesses.  They have both admitted to a greater or lesser extent that they have deceived and been dishonest to professionals working with them from Social Services and from the police.  However, even now, it is impossible to be clear what was the level of the parents' contact and relationship post May 2012.  However, I have found that it is likely that there was very much more of an ongoing relationship until the end of 2012, as stated by the father, but still denied by the mother.  Having said that, I found the evidence of both the mother and the father to be unconvincing.  The father showed little empathy for the children and for the mother, and little remorse for his role in the domestic violence.  He showed little empathy or remorse over his lateness on occasions for contact, which caused N to be distressed and worried whether or not his father would attend.  He tried to minimise his role in the deception saying that he did not know post May 2012 about the involvement of Social Services with the mother, and had had no discussions with her about it.  I find that to be incredible.  It would be highly unlikely that he would not know that social workers were involved, and I find that he did know and thus he played an active part in that deception.  

 

The mother's evidence has been inconsistent between what she said to professionals on numerous topics and what she said in her written evidence, and again what she said to me in her oral evidence to this court.  The mother too minimises the effect of the domestic violence on the children, and particularly on N, and shows a lack of empathy.  She said to me that although he had witnessed some things, when he is asleep he would not wake up.  I do not accept that.  I do not accept that he would not have been very aware, as I find, of the ongoing domestic violence between the parents.  

 

Thus, I find both of the parents to be unreliable witnesses, both on their own admissions as to dishonesty and for the reasons set out above.  Where there is a difference between the evidence given by the parents and the professional witnesses, particularly the evidence of Dr. Butler and Ms. Onya, I prefer the evidence of the professionals.  I do not accept that either of these two witnesses have actively lied to this court.  They would have had nothing to gain by doing so.  They have, in my view, acted entirely professionally.  Further, I do not accept that Dr. Butler was inaccurate in her recording of what the mother told her.  She was a careful witness and I find that she would have taken an accurate note of the conversations.  Having said that, I do give the parents credit for taking the very difficult decision in accepting, each of them, that they cannot care for their children.  

 

As to the evidence itself, I heard from Ms. Hall, the family finder.  She gave evidence.  Sadly, the information she had was less than satisfactory.  Despite being allocated at the end of September 2013, as yet it would seem there has been no permanency planning meeting whatsoever.  She thought it could take up to 10 months to find long-term foster care.  She would hope to have found a placement by then.  There were no long-term carers on the Wandsworth files and no one in-house or in the consortium.  She would ideally want energetic carers with humour and a good support network.  She had not known, before she was giving oral evidence, of N's severe behavioural difficulties or of his need for psychotherapy.  She thought it would then be more difficult to find carers.  She thought it might be more than six months to find long-term foster carers and to place.  She said that would include three months to go to panel, to match and to introduce.  She said that the only identified person thus far was a single 60-year-old Nigerian lady through the agency PACT.  Thus, I find that evidence entirely unsatisfactory. 

 

I heard from Ms. Onya.  She is the social worker in the case and she gave evidence before me.  Despite the many criticisms of the parents, I found her to be a warm and caring individual who was clearly very fond of these children, who she has come to know over a long period of time.  She seeks on behalf of the Local Authority a care order on a plan to place the children for long-term fostering.  She says very clearly that it has always been N's feelings he does not want to go to an African country.  She said that he can remember his visit when he was four and his aunts and uncle, and he has a nice memory that his uncle H gave him a bracelet which he wore.  She says she has used maps to discuss an African country, but he does not want to go.  She said that the children were well settled with the aunts and then they had to move, and they are with their current carer who, although inexperienced, has done very well with them.  The children can stay with her until they have to move again, and she will assist them, and that, in my view, will be very important.  She is concerned about a placement with the maternal grandmother, who she considers lacks insight and minimises the domestic violence between the parents.  She is worried that the maternal grandmother found L (this mother) challenging, and would find N challenging.  She believes that there could be a risk of breakdown in an African country, and therefore she cannot recommend that move.  She said that to move N to an African country would be moving him from his entire context and he needs therapy here.  She accepted that in the case of M that would be different and she alone of course could move.  

 

She is worried as well that if the parents went to an African country the maternal grandmother would not be able to protect against them.  However, she very fairly made enquiries of Woking Close to see if they would be able to do an assessment of the maternal grandmother if she were to come to the UK and if the court so ordered.  She told me that there would be space there, that there would be a european-speaking worker who would be part of the assessment team, and they could look at the maternal grandmother's insight and work alongside the foster carer.  At the same time they could search for a long-term carer in parallel.  As she has the most information about the children, she would want to be part of that work.  She accepted that there was no evidence that the maternal grandmother could not manage the children who were currently living with her, and she further accepted that her own viability assessment of the maternal grandmother had been positive.  I read from G80.  There Ms. Onya had found in her viability assessment that the grandfather and the grandmother had shown understanding of the enmeshed, unhealthy relationship that there was between E and L, and had identified the need for them to be supported to sever that damaging relationship completely.  She says that they both had shown an understanding of the impact of witnessing domestic violence and the harm caused to both N and M.  They, the grandparents, were clear about the need to create a safe and secure and healthy living environment for the children to grow up in.  So she said that, based on the information gathered from that assessment, she would recommend a fuller assessment of Mrs AN (the grandmother) for a special guardianship placement for N and M.  Should the placement be successful, it would enable her to have parental responsibility exclusive of the other, and this will allow the making of important decisions for the children to enable their ongoing needs to be met.  That is why there was then put into place a full assessment of the maternal grandmother.  But, despite that, her recommendation to the court is that I should not take the course of having any further assessment of the maternal grandmother, but she recommends that the children be placed now with long-term foster carers, with three times a year contact in respect of N, and four times to M.   

 

Ms. Coker, the independent social worker, gave evidence from Nigeria via videolink.  She provided two reports for the court - the first in November 2013 before she was able to conduct any real work in assessing the maternal grandmother, as she had been instructed to do so.  She had been unable to obtain a visa to go to an African country and to do any direct assessment of the maternal grandmother and the extended family.  Thus, there was a further court hearing, after which she conducted an assessment by Skype and telephone, and prepared her second report dated 30th December.  She spent two whole Saturdays conducting Skype interviews with the maternal grandmother, and with A, the older daughter, as an interpreter, and she had several telephone conversations.  Ms. Coker is also an enormously experienced social worker, with an impressive and lengthy CV.  She recognised of course that an assessment conducted as she had via Skype and telephone had significant limitations.  Nevertheless, she concluded that she had sufficient information to recommend a placement with the maternal grandmother.  I read from G436.  She said:

 

"The children were removed from a situation where their mother, probably due to her early trauma, had struggled to meet many of their needs.  In addition, N in particular was exposed to domestic violence, and the effects of psycho social development is concerning.  Both children have significant attachment disorders.  Any alternative care will need to be of high quality.  Research tells us that placement of children with their extended family or friendship networks are generally more successful than placements with strangers.  The initial indicators for this placement [that is with the maternal grandmother] were not good.  The maternal grandmother herself has suffered the trauma of being in an abusive marriage, and the older members of the family have lived through war and the associated trauma.  N, the older child, has stated very clearly he does not want to live in an African country.  It is still my view that he will need a high level of support to cope.  However, I also think it is unlikely that the children would be found an adoptive placement together.  The split from his sister is likely to be equally traumatic.  The more likely outcome is long-term foster care.  The children's mother, L, has suffered emotional abuse as a result of witnessing violence between her parents.  She may have also been exposed to sexual abuse by her paternal uncles, who are now dead.  The grandmother was not aware of L's sexual abuse, and claims she would have intervened if she had been aware.  The grandmother has since divorced the perpetrator of the domestic violence [that is the grandfather] and is now in a new relationship which is not violent.  The situation in an African country and the grandmother's personal circumstances have greatly changed since the time when she was raising L.  The grandmother has been aware for some time that her daughter was not meeting the children's needs.  She is also aware the children have a high level of need.  The grandmother has the time and the insight to provide the type of restorative parenting the children, especially N, will need.  Moreover, the children have a large supportive family network who can assist the grandmother to provide them with the high level of input they need.  Consequently, I am recommending placement with the maternal grandmother." 

	She goes on to say that the grandmother would have to identify a qualified psychotherapist in an African country.   

The full report of the independent social worker does give information that the maternal grandmother has good employment, that her other children all seem to be doing very well, that she has good accommodation, and could pay for the children to be privately educated, and for N to receive some therapeutic input.  Clearly there is no (or no very great) infrastructure in an African country to provide social work support at the sort of level of monitoring there would be in the UK.  However, there is international Social Services who could be informed about the children if they were placed there, and UNICEF are also working in the African country.  

 

She was cross-examined at length.  Her evidence was truncated due to the breakdowns in the link.  It was hampered as the large screen and main camera in the Royal Courts of Justice were not working.  That is in this country, I should add.  Nevertheless, the sound was good and I could observe Ms. Coker on a small monitor, although she could not see either myself or any of the advocates.  She was, however, it seemed to me, a forceful witness.  She was clear that there were, in her view, no guarantees in long-term fostering for these children.  She said in the care system children do get moved around and there are no guarantees.  There are often moved in not always a planned way, and the court, in her view, should not go down that route if there was time and money that could be put into the maternal grandmother.  She was in favour of the maternal grandmother coming to the UK, staying for a month and there being an intensive piece of work together with the skilled foster carer.  She thought that if there was a good, strong transitional plan, then she did not think there would be a breakdown if the children were placed in an African country. Thus, she maintained her recommendations.  

 

The maternal grandmother gave evidence via Skype and a videolink from an African country.  This evidence I find was very difficult to evaluate.  There were many practical disadvantages.  The link or bridge broke down and so the evidence was truncated.  There was a disconnect between the maternal grandmother speaking and the sound.  The large screen and the main camera in the Royal Courts of Justice were not working, so the maternal grandmother was unable to see the person who was asking the question, be it the judge or the advocate.  She could only be seen on a small monitor.  The translator had difficulties with the translation, due to the difficulties in hearing the witness and at times the interpreter became confused.  She, the interpreter, apologised at the end that her interpretation had not been satisfactory.  The parents were clearly critical of some of the interpretation, and I am not at all sure that I always received an accurate word-for-word account.  Although the children's Guardian was concerned that the maternal grandmother seemed to lack empathy for the mother, and she seemed to smile at times inappropriately, she was, as I could see, and I think the Guardian could not, at times responding to the interpreter who was the only person that the grandmother could see and who was in turn smiling at her.  With so many disadvantages - added to which the grandmother had not seen or had only seen very few of the papers beforehand; she had been sent a very long and complicated psychiatric report and the foster notes the weekend before she gave evidence, and these could only be interpreted by her daughter A, who could not understand all of the English - it seems to me that it would be intrinsically unfair to come to any conclusion as to her credibility as a witness.  I further add to that that although the Guardian was concerned about a lack of empathy between her and the mother, I had witnessed a voluntary engagement between the mother and the grandmother when the video Skype link was first set up.  I do not know what to make of that either, but it is part of the mix.  So, in those circumstances, taking all of that together, I do not form any conclusion about the credibility of the maternal grandmother as a witness.  

 

She is, however, clearly committed.  She clearly leads an ordered life.  From the information, she is managing her other children who are still at home, and the other adult children also lead ordered lives.  There are many question marks:  why was L sent to the UK when she was a young adolescent?  What is the reality of the grandmother's own experience of domestic violence?  Does she have any real insight into the domestic violence between the parents in their relationship and the effect on these children?  And does she have sufficient insight into N's special needs?  Could she manage the parents if they came to the  African country?  Is she minimising the difficulties when she says in her evidence that her love and the love of the family would conquer N's problems?  Those are all, at this moment, unanswered questions.  

 

The parents too gave evidence before me.  I have already set out my concerns and findings in relation to their evidence.  The mother says that she wants the children to live with the maternal grandmother.  She says she will not go back, at least for some time, to an African country, as she needs to be in the UK for medical attention, and she wants to go to college to do a cabin crew course with an aim to being an air stewardess.  She knows her contact to the children would be limited.  I find that she has minimised the effect of domestic violence on N and the effect of the anxiety about her health on him.  She accepted he knew she had to go to hospital but I do accept the teacher's evidence, at G35 of the bundle, that the mother spoke in front of N about being in hospital and said:  "Yes, I thought I was going to die".  The mother, like the father, has been late for contact and has missed some contacts, and particularly one which was arranged with N before Christmas.  She seemed to be reluctant in her evidence to accept the distress this would have caused the children.  They would have been sad and upset and confused.  She did agree that N has a lot of nightmares and screams and sleep walks.  She now denies the evidence that she gave to Dr.�Butler as to her childhood and her allegation that her father beat her, but I�have to accept, as I have already, that she did say these things to Dr. Butler, and I accept Dr. Butler's evidence on that.  

 

The father on the first day of this hearing also accepted that he could not care for the children.  He supports the application by the maternal grandmother.  He too wants to return to college and then get work.  He is currently of no fixed abode.  He stays with different friends.  He lives off money that is sent to him by his father.  He needs to get a more ordered life, in my view.  If the children go to an African country, he says he will accept supervision of any contact with them.  He believes, he says, that N at seven could adapt to life in An African country.  

 

Finally I heard the evidence of the very experienced children's Guardian, Ms.�Reed.  She has prepared two reports for the court.  She has seen the children and she has spoken to N.  She is clear that he is a curious and intelligent boy.  He does not want to go to an African country.  He does not like the heat, she told me.  She spoke to him about Africa.  She herself had lived in Africa.  She said he was clear to her that he did not want to live there.  He drew a picture of what he wanted.  It was a picture of himself and M and a person looking after them in the middle.  She supports the making of a care order and long-term fostering.  She would have preferred adoption of the two children, but accepts the evidence of Dr. Butler who is against adoption, and the family finder's evidence that the chances of finding a placement were remote.  She says that long-term foster carers will be carefully sought and carefully matched, and therefore that has the best chance of working in the children's best interests.  She believes that there is evidence of a high risk of breakdown if the children were to be placed with the maternal grandmother.  She said that if they were placed there, they could not be monitored or supported.  She does not think that the maternal grandmother's expectations of N are realistic.  She does not believe the parents, or at least she says she cannot believe the parents or their plans.  They may not do as the maternal grandmother says.  The mother and the maternal grandmother have a difficult relationship at times.  The parents could be angry and there could be flash points.  The maternal grandmother has struggled with L in the past and there has been real concern that she could not meet her needs, and so the Guardian has real concerns that she would not be able to meet the special needs of N.  She felt that the maternal grandmother was quite superficial in her evidence.  She felt that the grandmother did not have a level of insight, and that that could not be gained.  She says that loving the child, as the grandmother says, is not enough.  She felt that the maternal grandmother's evidence did not fit with what the independent social worker was saying in her report.  She was very concerned if N were placed in an African country it would be outside his context.  Nor does she support any further assessment.  She said that if there was a further assessment of the grandmother in this country, then that would be very distressing for N, and that his wishes should be given very serious consideration.  In other words, she says that there is sufficient evidence before the court that there would be such a high risk of breakdown with the maternal grandmother on sufficient information now before the court, that the court should not delay taking a decision but should make a care order with a care plan to place for long-term fostering.  

 

MY CONCLUSIONS  

Thus, there are, after eight days of hearing, only two options for the court:  a care order on a plan to place the children for long-term fostering, or, as it has now transpired, an adjournment of the final order under the auspices of interim care orders to allow an assessment of the maternal grandmother, she coming to the UK for such assessment, on a tight timetable and looking for long-term foster parents in parallel.   

 

I have to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option.  Insofar as long-term fostering is concerned, the advantages are:  (1) that it is supported and recommended by a formidable team of professionals - the social worker, Dr.�Butler and the children's Guardian; (2) that the children would remain together in the UK; (3) that there would be, I am sure, careful matching of carers and there would be support in place; (4) there would be psychotherapy for N; (5) the children would be in a context which is familiar to them, that is the UK, and particularly for N it is the language he speaks and the education system he knows; (6) the children would be able to have contact with their parents, as is recommended now by the social worker and Dr. Butler and the children's Guardian; (7) there would be continuing reviews of that placement and monitoring of it, and there would be an independent reviewing officer to oversee the placement.  

 

The disadvantages, as I find, are:  (1) that the children would remain in care and are thus different from other children, and that might become more important as they grow into adolescence; (2) there are no guarantees of stability and there are real risks of breakdown, and possibly unplanned moves, and I base that on the research; (3) it might be difficult to find a cultural and ethnic match, although I�accept that that would be ameliorated by ongoing contact with the parents, although it would be an infrequent amount; (4) N might become separated from M when he turned 18 and went on to independent living; (5) leaving care can be a difficult time for many young people, and often, the research shows us, they return to their birth families, and that in this case would be their parents, despite the known risks; (6) there could be a risk of disruption because of the parents in contact, although I accept that that would be ameliorated if it were well managed by the Local Authority.  

 

When I consider the advantages and disadvantages of placement with the maternal grandmother, that could only happen if there were a further assessment of her in the UK and that was successful, but the advantages would be:  (1) that the children would be within their natural family and this would include a wide extended family who are positive about the children and committed to them; (2) they would be with a grandmother who loves them and other family members who love them; (3) it would be overwhelmingly in M's best interests, as is said by Dr. Butler and Ms. Onya, if this matter were only about M and not about N too; (4) the parents' contact would in fact be less frequent than if the children were in foster care because it would only be about twice a year, and so it might be less disruptive and more manageable, although that would depend on the assessment of whether the maternal grandmother could contain it, but there could be ongoing more frequent contact by Skype; (5) the parents support that placement and usually it is thought that placements have more chance of working if they are supported by the parents so that the children could be told that this was a placement that all of the family wanted them to go to; (6) clearly it would meet their cultural and ethnic needs; (7) it is known that there are good practical matters in place - that is accommodation - and it would seem that the grandmother can meet the children's financial needs for schooling and day-to-day care; (8) there is evidence that she has managed, and continues to manage, her other young children.  

 

The disadvantages are that it would be:  (1) against N's expressed wishes and feelings; (2) that there are very many unknowns about the maternal grandmother and her evidence, and I have already set those out at length; (3) there would be a disruption in location to an unknown country and all that that would bring; (4) there would be a change therefore in the context particularly for N of his language and education system; (5) if there was a breakdown it is not clear what the back-up plan would be, although the independent social worker thought that there was such a large extended family they would be likely to step into the breach; (6) it could not be monitored or supported in any real sense by this Local Authority. 

 

Thus, I have looked at the positives and negatives of the two options.  I have come to a very clear conclusion.  I do give weight to N's wishes and feelings but I do so in the light of his age and understanding.  He is only seven and a half.  I have considered long and hard the weight of professional opinion in support of making a care order now on the plan for long-term fostering, and the view that the court has sufficient information to conclude that the risks in a placement with the maternal grandmother are too high to take.  However, I�conclude that, given that there are two positive assessments - one being the viability assessment conducted by Ms. Onya and the other the assessment of the independent social worker - and given that the maternal grandmother has not had the advantage, as any grandparent would have had in the UK, of attendance at court, a proper and full assessment, including contact with the children and an evaluation of the relationship, and possibly independent legal advice, it would be quite wrong now to conclude that such a full assessment of her would be bound to fail, or that after a full assessment I would be bound to conclude that the risks in placement in an African country were too great to take.  It may be that once the grandmother is fully assessed in the UK, face to face, that many of the unknowns as I have set them out to be are in fact adequately addressed, and that, once N re-meets his maternal grandmother and can make a picture of his life in an African country, that he will become reassured.  

 

I simply do not know and, thus, applying the legal test, as I must, I conclude that I am bound to adjourn these proceedings under the auspices of interim care orders for there to be that full assessment of the maternal grandmother in the UK.  I am reinforced in this view as there will be no delay for the children because long-term foster carers can be sought in parallel, and I am extremely grateful to the social worker, Ms.�Onya, and to the Local Authority team, notwithstanding their recommendations to this court, in putting into place Woking Close as a place which could conduct such an assessment in a timely way with experienced workers, one of whom is European speaking.  I�am quite satisfied, having looked at the quality of their assessments of the parents, that they would conduct a full and considered assessment of the maternal grandmother and that that would be the fair way forward, and a chance for the children to be brought up in their natural family if it is at all possible.  The grandmother of course will have to make her own arrangements for a visa.  She will have to come to this country as soon as is possible.  The assessment will have to be conducted within a good time frame with a view perhaps to it being concluded by mid-March.  There would then be time for timetabling, and I�would hear this case in about the second week of May.   

 

I have neglected to mention contact in the interim, I think, at all, but I do accept that as the children are not to go home to either of the parents, it would be right and it would be consistent with that plan and that acceptance of the parents, that the contact should be reduced, and reduced immediately, and it seems to me that the recommendation for it to be reduced monthly in respect of N and fortnightly in respect of M would be the right reduction pending their long-term placement, and I suppose pending the adjourned hearing.  In any event, given that I have now ordered that there should be an assessment of the maternal grandmother, when she comes to this country there is going to be a very intensive piece of work which is going to include contact with her.  I have seen the Woking Close proposal, which is very intensive indeed, and during that time I think that it is likely that the contact with the parents would have to take second place anyway, and might well be reduced further than the monthly to N and fortnightly to M, to allow for the amount of contacts and work that would have to go into the assessment of grandmother.

     IN THE THIS CITY COUNTY COURT 
  
  Date: 21/02/2014   Before :   HER HONOUR JUDGE HILARY WATSON - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Between : 
      
    M S J   Applicant     
    - and -         
    S K -and- M K    Respondent Mother Second Respondent Paternal Grandmother       - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - JUDGMENT         HHJ Watson :      1.                  The Applicant Father, seeks a shared residence order, and seeks to take S to California, USA for extended periods of time during the school holidays. Paternal Grandmother, seeks contact on alternate week ends , overnight from Saturday to Sunday with her granddaughter during which time she will facilitate skype contact with father in America. Mother does not oppose the principle of holiday contact in America but there is a dispute about the length of the stay. She does oppose a shared residence order preferring that S should reside with her under a sole residence order. Mother disputes the frequency of contact with paternal grandmother and the extended paternal family and suggests that contact once every three weeks is preferable because it allows mother quality time at week ends with her daughter particularly as she sometimes has to work overtime at week ends. She would initiate weekly skype contact on her smart phone so S did not miss out on indirect contact with her father. 2.                  The parties have been able to agree many aspects of the applications but have asked the court to resolve the outstanding issues. 3.                  After hearing evidence from mother and the CAFCASS officer the paternal grandmother has given clear instructions to her barrister Miss Popley that she wishes to put the past behind her and re build trusting relations with the maternal family. She recognises mother�s work commitments and agrees with mother�s proposal of three weekly visits to the grandmother�s home. In the spirit of compromise and co operation mother has also agreed that contact will end at 12 noon on Sunday when S will be collected from the Temple. A rift between grandmother and maternal grandfather has been resolved amicably having heard evidence from mother about the perception of the event through the grandfather�s eyes and he can now be fully involved in handovers as before. 4.                  I heard oral evidence from the cafcass officer, Ms Letisha Williams. She had not had any involvement with the family since her last report in September 2013 and told the court that she noticed a marked change in the attitude of mother towards contact, her general demeanour and attitude had changed and she agreed that things had moved on. 5.                  S was born on 3 December 2009 and is the child of Mother and Father who were a married couple at the time living in America although both were brought up in the UK. Father is a university Professor at a prestigious research institute in California. When the parties separated in 2009 Mother and S returned to this city to reside with the maternal grandparents. Mother and S remain living with maternal grandparents. The paternal family also live in the city a 5-10 minute drive from the maternal family home. Although mother drives she does not have a car and is reliant on her father to drive her. Paternal grandmother does not drive and she is dependant on others for lifts. 6.                  Unfortunately there was an incident between the maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother which resulted in an exchange of words on 8 February in front of S which has now been resolved between the parties in the interests of their joint grandchild. 7.                  S was just 3 months old when her parents separated and she returned to this city with her mother. The parties subsequently divorced and father has a fianc�e and plans to marry and have a family. I have not been told that mother has any plans to remarry. Mother is, I understand, a qualified solicitor and works for the Law Society in an administrative capacity. She is on a temporary contract but hopes to secure permanent employment. She works 35 hours Monday to Friday and has normal holidays. Additionally she has been asked to do overtime at weekends whilst the Law Society is installing a new financial system. She told the court that she feels that she has to do the overtime in order to put herself in the best position to secure a permanent position. The court is sympathetic to that sentiment in the current job market 8.                  Since January the parties have moved away from the three weekly arrangement for contact with paternal grandmother agreed previously at court to a fortnightly pattern of visiting contact on a Saturday with handovers at a local Temple. Mother gave evidence that this was not working for her and S because mother has been working overtime and has not been able to spend time with her daughter because of the frequency of the contact arrangements. The paternal family are extensive and S has been able to spend time with them and has enjoyed that. The father has good quality skype contact with S. From the paternal side the fortnightly contact was working well but overnight would be preferable because it would allow skype contact at S�s bedtime which coincides with early mornings for father in America. 9.                  Father believes S is now ready to travel to the USA with paternal grandmother and other extended family members to enjoy contact in father�s home. Mother agrees that she is ready but is cautious about rushing things for S. She had a bad experience in India when she had taken S aged two for a holiday in India but although S was with her mother and grandmother she did not settle and cried at night and wanted to go home. Mother had to return to England early and S had been fine on her return. She is concerned that the longest S has been away from her is four nights over Christmas when S stayed with her father at the home of the paternal family and mother fears that she might become very distressed and homesick and would be a very long way from home. Father says that S is comfortable with him and that she can skype her mother daily or every other day. He is confident S would cope well and enjoy time in her father�s home. 10.              Mother has agreed a progressive plan for holiday contact in America which builds from 7 days at Easter in the USA to 3 weeks in the Summer holidays and 10 days at Christmas. Father is agreeable to this staged approach but requests 7 consecutive nights at Easter and 10 nights at Christmas. From 2015 all parties are agreed that contact should be for 6 weeks in the summer and 1 week in the UK for both Christmas and Easter or Spring Break which is the American equivalent. In 2016 4 weeks in the USA over the summer, two weeks at Christmas in the USA and 1 week at Easter in the UK. The arrangements will then alternate as in 2015 and 2016. 11.              Ms Williams was rather concerned that 6 weeks might be too much for S and would have preferred a shared school holiday arrangement. 12.              In my judgment the arrangements are carefully thought through and are reasonable arrangement for a child whose parents live on different continents and who will have to travel significant distances long haul. She needs to have extended periods of time to settle into her father�s home and to enjoy family life with him. Father works in education and has the advantage of extended academic holidays whereas mother works regular full time hours. The agreed arrangements maximise the time S can spend with her father during school holidays when otherwise her mother is working. I am satisfied that both parents have agreed what will meet S�s needs and meet her best interests.  13.              The parties reflected overnight on the views of CAFCASS and mother and agreed that S will be returned to her mother�s care in good time to allow 4 full days for S to recover from the flight and get ready for the return to school. 14.              In any proceedings in which any question with respect to the upbringing of a child arises the child�s welfare shall be the court�s paramount consideration. 15.              Child development research referred to in the CAFCASS report of Ms Williams reminds the court and the parties that � children are more likely to attain their psychological potential when they are able to develop and maintain meaningful relationships with both their parents, whether the two parents live together or not� ( Kelly and Lamb 2003). 16.              It is important for S to have the opportunity to develop her relationship with her father. 17.              S is described as a well adjusted and happy child when in the care of either parent. It is a credit to her mother that S is such a happy and well adjusted child and can go happily to stay with her paternal family. It is also a credit to the care she receives from her father and paternal grandmother that she can settle so well with them and return happily to her mother at the end of contact. S attends nursery and the nursery staff confirm that she is an emotionally attuned and well adjusted child. 18.              Having regard to the welfare checklist I have no doubt that S�s wishes and feelings would be to maintain the strong and healthy relationships she has with all the important people in her life. I have to have regard to her circumstances as a much loved child who has two extended families and a father who lives and works in the USA. Both parents are able to meet her physical, emotional and educational needs and she has no special characteristics which mean she should be treated differently from any other 4 year old. Travelling to America will be a very dramatic change in her circumstances but her parents have agreed that she will be accompanied by a familiar adult, her father or grandmother or paternal aunt in future years and there is no reason to doubt that her father will provide her with a suitable bedroom and toys to stimulate and amuse her. S is a child who is used to speaking to her father by skype and will adjust to speaking to her mother in the same way. There are no welfare considerations and either parent is well able to meet her needs. 19.              Mother is bound to be anxious, that is normal, but this for S is an adventure, an opportunity and a natural development of the bond she has with her father. Mother will remain pivotal in the care of her daughter. It is agreed that S is habitually resident in England and that she is well integrated into the community and will be attending a primary school in this city. S has always been in the care of her mother and the arrangements which provide for the time S spends with her father are intended to promote her relationship with her father but not to undermine her relationship with her mother. Both her parents are equally important for S�s emotional well being.  20.              Father seeks a shared residence order so that he has a greater input in the decision making process and that the importance of his role in S�s life is recognised by her mother. He believes that her dual residence status will give her long term benefits both in the UK and USA in relation to education and life chances. 21.              Mother resists this saying that residence should reflect the reality of the situation. To use the words cited in the skeleton argument of Ms Buxton on behalf of mother the court order should reflect the underlying reality of where the children live their lives. She sees no reason to change the residence status from the current interim residence order. She is willing to keep father informed and has promised to send him a monthly newsletter. S resides in the UK. Her home is in the UK and when she goes to America it is for a holiday with her father. Mother could foresee difficulties with a �shared residence order� because she had encountered problems with the interim residence order. When pressed to say who she had shown the order to she said the health visitor, nursery and the Indian Embassy when applying for a visa. She suggested that she had encountered problems because the order was an interim residence order. 22.              I am quite satisfied on the evidence I heard that it was not the interim residence order that caused difficulties for mother but her decision to take S out of the jurisdiction of the court to India without first obtaining the written consent of father. The interim residence order made 29 July 2011 at D33 in the bundle was unambiguous in its terms when a residence order is in force no person may remove the child from the UK without the written consent of every person with PR for the child. Father only learnt that she had taken S to India, not once but twice, when the child�s medical records were produced and references seen to vaccinations and foreign travel advice. I accept his evidence that he was not consulted and it is not disputed that written consent was not sought but in my judgment neither was he told about the trip. 23.              Mother has recently obtained a smart phone with skype facilities but notwithstanding much correspondence about mother�s lack of access to the internet and inability to skype at earlier hearings she did not tell father. It was only at court that she offered skype contact with father. Sadly this does not give the court confidence that she would actively promote contact by different means if not prompted by a court order. 24.              On the other hand the court must put into the balance the spirit of co operation and compromise between all parties that has emerged at and during the course of this the final hearing, which is a positive indicator for the future. 25.              I have been referred to the case of Re D 2006 FLR 1006 which is a case illustrating that a shared residence order was appropriate where children would be spending significant amounts of time in the UK and USA. Another case where a shared residence order was made across jurisdictions is Mv H 2008 1 FLR 1400. 26.              I remind myself that I have to have regard to S�s short, medium and long term well being. There has recently been a significant shift in case law in favour of shared residence and this trend is likely to continue when the Children and Families bill becomes law. 27.              For S I can summarise the advantages as underlining the importance of the role of each of her parents in her life. Promoting co operation between the parents. Reinforcing the importance of contact with the other parent. Ensuring that all important decisions in her life are taken jointly. In short emphasising that both parents are equal in the eyes of the law. Mother does not agree with such a course because it is, she says, unnecessary and does not reflect the reality of the child�s life. 28.              In my judgment the advantages for S outweigh the disadvantages. S will be spending significant time in America in the sole care of her father who will be making all the day to day decisions for her whilst she resides with him, just as mother does now and will continue to do in the future. Mother has not always involved father in important decisions for S and that needs to change. School and visa applications are just examples of important decisions coming up. S will have two homes; one with her mother and one with her father. She will also spend time at the home of her paternal grandmother. The shared residence order is a reminder that S has two parents and that each needs to consult the other about matters concerning their daughter. 29.              Now that I have resolved the issue of residence I need to consider what arrangements should be in place to ensure she maintains a secure and stable home life with her mother in the UK as well as her father in the USA. 30.              It is agreed that S will go to school from her mother�s home and that her mother�s role is pivotal. During term time it will be mother who establishes the daily routines and organises her out of school activities. Contact with the paternal family is important and needs to be promoted but there has to be a balance between her home life with her mother and her contact with her paternal family. I accept mother�s evidence that the fortnightly contact has greatly impacted on her precious week end time with her daughter and now that overnight contact has been agreed for paternal grandmother it is possible for grandmother to have good quality contact but less frequently. 31.              Contact for Grandmother will take place every three weeks by agreement and will be from 11 on Saturday to 12 noon on Sunday. Grandmother will collect S from her home on Saturday and mother will pick her up from Temple on Sunday. 32.              Mother will facilitate weekly skype chats between S and her father which will take place on Saturday at a mutually convenient time and will be in addition to the skype communication when with the paternal family. 33.              I can see no reason why Easter contact in 2014 should not be for 7 consecutive nights in the USA which will allow S to recover from her long haul flight, settle into routines at her father�s home before making the return journey. S will be returned to her mother immediately upon her return. 34.              Similarly there is very good reason to make the contact at Christmas a reasonable period but 10 consecutive nights in the USA will not give S (aged just 5 in December 2014) sufficient time to recuperate from the excitement of the Christmas term and I direct that she should spend 9 consecutive nights but S must return to her mother in good time to settle before the start of the new school term. As she gets older she will be better able to cope with less recuperation time. I remind myself of mother�s evidence that she did not settle well in India aged 2. 35.              S is very fortunate to have parents who love her deeply and wish only to do what is best for her. She is also fortunate to be well integrated into loving extended families on both sides. The adults should remember that she is a 4 year old child and she needs to be given support whilst she settles into her new routines and all the adults should be sensitive to her wishes and feelings and co operate with each other in making these arrangements work. 36.              The Court, if asked, will make orders, but the people best placed to make decisions for S are her parents. These proceedings started when S was less than one year old. The court has made a shared residence order so both parents can now take responsibility for making the important decisions for their daughter in the future.

JUDGE LEVY:

	1  Introduction.

This judgment relates to the final hearing in private law proceedings concerning three children "A", a boy born 17th May 2001, age 12 years 7 months, " B" a girl born 29th March 2004, age 9 years 9 months, and "C" a boy born 24th October 2005, age 8 years 2 months.   I will refer to the parents as "the mother" and "the father" and together as "the parents".  

 

I have considered the practice guidance issued by Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, on 16th January 2014 on transparency in the Family Courts and the publication of judgments, which takes effect from 3rd February 2014.  I have decided that it is in the public interest to publish this judgment in anonymised form. I invited the parties to make representations about publication: the father wishes the judgment to be published, the mother does not object.

 

This is my third judgment in this matter. My "first judgment" dated 12th June 2013 and my "second judgment" dated 15 October 2013 should be read together with this judgment. Neither has been published but they will now be anonymised and published so that all three judgments can be read together.

 

In the course of this hearing and in his written submissions the father has accused Mrs. Christina Lemonides, a Family Court Adviser with CAFCASS, and Dr. Gary John Wannan, a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist jointly instructed by the parents as an expert, of gross professional misconduct. He has given notice of his intention to report them to their respective professional bodies. On the basis of his allegations, the father invites me to disregard their evidence in its entirety.  I have considered the most serious of the father's allegations. I have not dealt with every allegation the father has made, but have focussed on those necessary to enable me to determine his application and to be fair to Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan. As will become clear, I reject the father's criticisms of Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan and refuse his application. I will therefore refer to their evidence throughout this judgment.

 

In preparation for this hearing I read three bundles of documents. I have read the parents' 11 witness statements (each) and a number of reports which I will refer to. The hearing took place on 9th, 12th and 16th December 2013. The father and the mother filed written submissions, respectively on 24th and 27th December, which I received on 6th January 2014. I heard oral evidence from Mrs. Lemonides, Dr. Wannan, the father and the mother.  I have listened to two recordings which the father made of his conversations with the children during contact. I have listened to the recording of the hearing before District Judge Marin on 18th February 2013. 

 

The father was in person. As I explained in my first judgment, he is a solicitor of some 20 years' experience in commercial property.  Since the fact finding hearing he has been represented by counsel, through the direct access scheme, at some hearings; at the final hearing he chose to put his own case, which I am satisfied he is able to do. Miss Mary-Jane Taylor again appeared for the mother.  

 

By way of background, the parents married in 1991 but after some 20 years their marriage broke down.  Tensions increased throughout 2009 and in December 2009 the father left the family home.  The children had staying contact with the father at the paternal grandmother's home, where he lived, every weekend from Friday until Saturday evening and on Tuesday evenings.  In September 2011, after a separation of some 21 months, by agreement he returned to live in the family home.  The reconciliation was not successful and in July 2012 the mother issued a divorce petition. The father left the family home at the end of October 2012 and she obtained a Decree Nisi on 13th November 2012. The children have continued to live with their mother and to have staying contact with their father one night each week.

 

2  Findings of fact.

Following the fact finding hearing which took place over eight days between 13th and 22nd May 2013, I made the findings which are summarised below. The numbering refers also to the numbering of the allegation.

 

	Finding 1 - in 2006 the father attempted to solve a problem for  B (age 2� ) in a way, which was insensitive, ill judged, and not child centred. 

	Finding 2 - in 2008 the father pulled a duvet over C's face (age 3); the child told the mother he could not breathe; the father said he was playing a game and did not pull the duvet tight.
	
	Finding 3 - in 2007 or 2008 the father held a lighter to the mother's thigh in front of the children and said that he wanted to know when she would feel pain.

	Finding 5 - in 23rd February 2009 the father threatened the mother with a knife to her neck and forced her down the stairs at knife point in front of C (age 3); he threatened her with the knife until she wrote a letter cancelling their insurance policy. 

	Finding 6 - on 7th March 2009 the father insisted that B eat some food he had prepared. He told her that he would punish her so badly that she would never forget it. 

	Finding 7 - from late 2008 to December 2009 the father was emotionally abusive to C: (a) he repeatedly told C that his mother was never coming home; (b) he would leave him out of activities; and (c) he would tell him off unfairly.

	Finding 8 - the father told A that his mother was trying to kill him and that she was a bad person and a liar.  

	Finding 9 - on 9th May 2009 the father questioned B and A about which parent they wanted to live with; he grabbed A's arm and called the police alleging the mother was abusing A.  The father barricaded himself and A in the kitchen.

	Finding 13 - in August 2009 during a family holiday, the father insisted that the family climb a mountain. The father had said he would buy C a toy wolf but changed his mind when C did not respond to him.  The father insisted the family continue to climb despite the mother's protests and B crying.  The father bullied C during the climb then ignored him for the rest of the day.

	Finding 14 - in September 2009 the father told the children that the mother shouted at him and made him feel like 'a worthless piece of shit'.  He tried to encourage the children to repeat this.  

	Finding 15 - in 2008 or 2009, when B did not answer the father's call for breakfast, he dragged her up by her arm.

	Findings 16 and17 - on 13th/14th December 2009 when the father's family were leaving, the mother ran upstairs into the bedroom out of fear.  The father followed her and tried to shut the door on her, but she wedged her body in the doorway to keep it open.  He reached his hand through the gap, pushed her throat and squeezed.  

	Finding 18 - in or around 2009, the father told C he would cut his fingers off.  He put C's fingers on the chopping board.  When the mother protested, the father said it was a joke and stopped.
	Finding 19 - In November 2011 the father told the children that he was unhappy and stressed at work and that he wished he were dead.

	Finding 20 - On 16th or 17th May 2012 the father followed B to the toilet in the middle of the night and insisted that she go to his room to talk about "their problems".  B was crying and said that he kept her there for an hour, although it was probably not that long.  

		Finding 21 - In May 2012 the father told the children that they must keep conversations with him secret from the mother.

	Finding 22 - On 16 June 2012 the father called B an "ugly loser".

	Finding 23 - on various occasions the father verbally abused and belittled the mother.  He has told her she is 'fat' and 'ugly'. He has also said, sometimes in front of the children, that she is "stupid", "fat", "evil", "a liar" and that she "will die sad and alone because in a few years' time the children will hate (her)".

	Finding 25 - on 23rd September 2012 in the presence of B, in the course of an argument, which the father provoked and recorded, without the mother's knowledge, she said to him: "You are completely mad, you are absolutely insane, you need help".  The mother genuinely wanted the father to get some help and this was not calculated abuse.

	Finding 44 - It is accepted that A did not want to carry messages between his parents, and he should not have been used in this way.  The father said that the mother was a liar and an abuser.

	Finding 51 - The mother should not have carried A in her car without a seat-belt, which she accepted. The father should not have taken A to the police station to report this.  His actions caused the younger children concern and led to yet another visit by the police to the family home.  

	Finding 52 - on 12 May 2013 the father made A and B read the CAFCASS report dated 25th March 2013 and pressurised them to write letters to the "court lady".  Both children expressed concern the following day that the court lady would be cross with them for writing the letters.

The final hearing was originally listed on 18th and 19th September 2013 but 

 
I adjourned it when I learned that the father's application for permission to appeal my first judgment was listed for oral hearing on 17th September 2013. His application was refused by Lewison LJ but it appears that the father sought to re-open his decision. In his further decision dated 28th November 2013 Lewison LJ said:

"The application to re-open my decision to refuse permission to appeal is no more than a re-run of the arguments contained in the original Appellant's Notice and seeks once again to challenge the trial judge's findings of fact. I was satisfied that there was no real prospect of success in that challenge and I remain so satisfied. The fact that I did not, in my oral judgment, deal with each allegation individually does not come close to a 'corruption' of the legal process."

	He noted that the application was made over two months after the first application had been refused and very shortly before the final hearing in the county court. For the avoidance of doubt he stated that he did not direct an oral hearing and there is no right of appeal or review from his decision which is final.

The father indicated to me at a hearing on 1 October 2013 that he was considering a further appeal, I understood to the European Court of Human Rights. I ordered him to file and serve, by 18th October, a letter setting out the details of his proposed further appeal. [B250] I needed to consider what impact a further appeal might have on the revised timetable for the final hearing. The father did not comply with my order.

 

On 15th October 2013 I handed down my second judgment in which I refused the father's application for an order pursuant to Rule 16(4) of the Family Proceedings Rules 2010, making the children parties to the proceedings and appointing a guardian from the National Youth Advocacy Service to represent them.  I made further findings: 

 

	(i)	I considered that the mother is not intractably opposed to contact and had sustained it when others might not have done.[Second judgment, para. 28]

	(ii)  I do not consider that this is an intractable dispute in the sense that one parent is implacably opposed to the children having contact with the other parent.  The mother has concerns about contact but she has offered further contact.  She has repeatedly said that she will be guided by the professionals and the court.  [Second judgment, para. 38]

	(iii)	By contrast, and as a result of my findings, I have made the father's contact conditional upon his behaviour. In order to prevent the children from being drawn further into these proceedings, and to reduce the risk of harm to them, I required undertakings from the father. [Second judgment, para. 39]

	3  Outstanding Applications and the Parties' Positions.

These are as follows: 

 

	(i)  	The father's application that I disregard the evidence of Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan. 

	(ii)  	The father's application for four findings of fact against the mother, as set out in paras.11-16 of his tenth witness statement dated 6th December 2013 [C274-275].

	(iii)  	The mother's application for a finding that the father has denigrated her in front of the children.  

	(iv)	The father's application for a shared residence order on the basis that the children spend 60 per cent of their time with the mother and 40 per cent of their time with him.

	(v) 	The mother's application for a sole residence order and that the father's application be dismissed. 

	(vi)	The mother's application for a defined contact order reducing the children's direct and indirect contact with the father and a providing that contact be subject to conditions 

	(vii)	The mother's application for an order pursuant to s 91(14) Children Act 1989, for a duration of five years.  	

	(viii)	The father's application for prohibited steps and specific issues orders in relation to the children's medical and dental appointments and treatment and B's education. 

	(ix)	The mother's application for specific issues orders in relation to the children's health, including appointments with doctors and dentists and any treatment resulting from such appointments and any referrals to and treatment at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ("CAMHS"), and their schooling.

	(x) 	The mother's application for an order that the father pay the whole costs of Dr Wannan's addendum report.

	(xi)	The mother's application for an order that the father pay her costs of the fact finding hearing, assessed as �28,844.00, such costs to be deducted from any monies he obtains from the sale of the former matrimonial home and to be paid by the conveyancing solicitor directly to the mother.

	4  Recent Developments.
	  	 
On 19th April 2013 Deputy District Judge Hopkins gave judgment following a two day hearing of the parties' applications for financial orders.  The father has told me that his application for permission to appeal her order was refused on paper and his application for an oral hearing, made in July, has not yet taken place.  The mother's solicitor has been told by the Principal Registry that there is no outstanding application for an oral hearing of the father's application.  

 
I will return to the order of Deputy District Judge Hopkins later in this judgment.  I refer to it at this point to indicate that it is an outstanding matter. 

In my first judgment I noted that the father accepted that he had persistently failed to comply with the contact order made on 25th October 2012, by bringing the children back late after contact on almost every Saturday.  He continued to return them late and in my order of 14th June 2013 I attempted to define contact further by making it conditional on the father's compliance with the terms of the order and permitting the mother to suspend contact if he were to breach any of the conditions.  I clarified issues with regard to handovers, including the return time of 7pm, and prevented the father from approaching the family home.  Indirect contact in the form of telephone and/or face time would take place on Tuesday and Thursday evenings between 7.15 pm and 7.45 pm.  The order specified that all such contact is to cease at 7.45 pm.  [para.5(c)]

 


I listed the final hearing on 18th and 19th September and ordered Mrs. Lemonides to file and serve an addendum report setting out her recommendations and the children's wishes and feelings with regard to shared residence and holiday contact. I listed a pre-hearing review on 2nd August 2013.

 

As result of events which I described in paragraphs 18 - 20 of my second judgment, the focus of the hearing on 2nd August 2013 was Mrs. Lemonides' risk assessment and her recommendation that the father's contact should be suspended immediately. This came as a shock to both parents. The mother who had said that she would be guided by Mrs. Lemonides made an application to suspend contact which I refused. [Second judgment, para. 21]

 

I was told that the father was not providing the children with a meal prior to returning them at the end of contact and that he was continuing to discuss the proceedings and issues relating to contact with the children.  My order of 

 
2nd August 2013 [B237] reiterated the order I had made on 14th June and provided that it would continue on condition that the father adheres to all of the undertakings given that day.  In the event that any of the undertakings were breached, the mother could suspend contact.   

The father gave the following undertakings:-

 

	(i)	Not to discuss the Children Act proceedings, or the case in general with the children, or any CAFCASS report. 

	(ii)	Not to discuss the issue of contact with the children and, in particular, holiday contact.

	(iii)	To return within 48 hours any belonging that either the mother or one of the children requests and that has been left with him and that he is able to locate.

	(iv)	Not to give the children anything resembling a weapon, even if its purpose be decorative. 

	The mother had raised her concern that the father was speaking of her in a denigratory manner to the children, and I invited the father to undertake not to do so.  My order recites that the father declined to give an undertaking not to make derogatory comments about the mother in the presence of the children.  

The hearing on 3rd September 2013 was listed so that I could consider the progress of contact and the father's application that the children be made parties to the proceedings.  I refused the father's application but ordered that he could renew it at the next hearing when I would be considering it in the light of the result of his application for permission to appeal my first judgment.  

 
I asked the parties to consider whether there was a need for an expert report from a psychiatrist or psychologist. The father applied for an order that 
I remove Mrs. Lemonides from the case and all her reports from the court file. I refused the application, indicating that it would not be appropriate to make such a decision when Mrs. Lemonides had not been given notice of the application and was not at court to answer it. I decided to use one of the dates 
I had vacated to hear Mrs. Lemonides' evidence.  Unfortunately, that hearing was put back to 1st October 2013 because of her ill-health. 

On 1st October Mrs. Lemonides' evidence was not completed. The mother offered additional contact on 31st October 2013 for Halloween and I was told that the parents had agreed to change contact so that the father would have contact with C on his birthday.  The father wished to renew his application, 

 
I invited written submissions (due to lack of time) and handed down my second judgment on 15th October 2013.

Throughout the period covered by these hearings the mother expressed continuing concerns about direct contact and this was recorded in the preamble to my order dated 1st October 2013. [B249]

 

5	  The Father's Case.

Findings of Fact.

The father does not accept the findings in my first judgment, as demonstrated by his applications to the Court of Appeal.  It is equally clear from his evidence, both written and oral, that he does not accept the findings which I made in my second judgment.  

 

The father repeatedly refers to the mother as a liar, who abuses, bullies and controls the children and seeks to undermine his contact with them.  In his seventh witness statement dated 30th September 2013 he said: 

 

"In the recent fact finding hearing it was established that she had lied and exaggerated in her previous statements". [C242, para. 2]

	I made no such finding against the mother, indeed I found that she did not exaggerate [First judgment 1, para. 44] and that she was not vindictive [para.45].  Overall, I found the mother's evidence to be measured, honest and reliable [para. 59] and, on balance, when there were factual differences between the parents' evidence I preferred that of the mother [para.65].  

The father's evidence as to his attitude to the findings was contradictory. He told me that they were wrong and unfair, and some of them were historic and not relevant to the welfare of the children in the future.  They relate to a period when his marriage with the mother was breaking up and the children were exposed to acrimony between their parents which was both parents' responsibility. He also told me that it was the mother's fault because she could have taken steps to remove the children from the situation.  He said that there are some findings which he does accept but some are wrong and also: "I accept there has been stuff which the court was right to consider and which I have reflected on and addressed". 

 

The father sets out his position plainly in his 11th witness statement:  

 

"It has always been my position that the respondent is controlling and abusive to the children.  The court has not yet accepted that position but that does not mean that it is untrue." [C290, para.3]

	It is clear that he does not like the mother. Mrs. Lemonides told me that the father's approach to contact is "clouded with angry feelings" (about the mother). The father spoke to Dr. Wannan about "the mother's faults" and his naivety in pursuing a relationship with her.  He does not like communicating with her because she lies and undermines him; she would be a better mother if she were true in her allegations; he would never communicate with her again.   

Dr. Wannan told me that he has observed that the father's criticisms of the mother are very largely unfounded.  Rather than accept criticisms and suggestions for changes he could make, he is critical of her.  

 

The father told Miss Taylor that his description of the mother as "controlling and abusive" is not negative, but a description of a character trait she has, and a position which he takes in court proceedings.  He told me: "I may not like it but she's their mother. � I have to put up with it � the children are strong enough to survive."

 

The Father's Allegations 

The father seeks four findings against the mother which arise out of his recent contact with the children.  By way of background, he claims that the telephone/face time contact is problematic because the half an hour allocated is rarely sufficient for adequate interaction with the children in the way that they want.  

 

On 22nd November 2013 the father says that he was having an involved and animated conversation with C and B on face time which went on beyond the 7.45 pm deadline.  He alleges that the mother asked A to record the conversation in order to prove to the court that he was talking to the children beyond the time specified in the court order. He brought evidence in the form of recordings he had made of his indirect contact with the children which he said supported his case. I turn to my consideration of the father's application to admit his recordings.

 

The Father's Recordings of the Children during Contact.

After Dr. Wannan left court at the end of the first day of the hearing, the father applied for permission to admit two recordings he had made of the children's conversations during contact. The first was of contact on 22nd November 2013 [C 273, para.11] although it transpired that this was not a recording of the contact but of a conversation he had with A about that contact, some days later.  The second was of contact on 3rd December 2013. He told me that he has tried to record every indirect contact with the children since December 2012.  At direct contact he switches on the recording function on his mobile phone if the children mention their mother.    He has not kept all the recordings. He had had the two recordings in his possession since 23rd November and 3rd December 2013 respectively, but he had not disclosed their existence. He emailed them to the mother's solicitors overnight.

 

The father argued that the recordings would be of assistance to the court in assessing the mother's character.  The fact that there has so far been no finding of emotional abuse of the children by the mother had "greatly skewed the proceedings". He relied on his account of Dr. Wannan's acceptance, in his oral evidence, that at least some of the mother's behaviour, as the father described it, would amount to emotional abuse of the children.  This was not my understanding of Dr. Wannan's evidence.  

 

The father said that the mother and the court had known since the fact finding hearing that he makes recordings of his interaction with the children; he had never been criticised. During the fact finding hearing I listened to the father's recording of his argument with the mother on 23rd September 2012.  I noted that the recording had been made without her knowledge. He had provoked an argument and set a trap for her, in order to produce evidence to the court that she is an abuser.  I found that what the mother said to the father was not calculated abuse.  [Judgment 1, paras. 176 - 177].  

 

The father insisted that Miss Taylor made an unsuccessful application to District Judge Marin on 18th February 2013 for an order preventing him from making further recordings, which was not appealed.  He said: "You made the application, you know you did, you know it was refused."  I listened to the recording of the hearing, during which Miss Taylor objected to the admission of the recording and the father's transcript. The mother was concerned that if they were admitted, the father would be able to continue to record telephone conversations with the children which put them in the middle of the conflict.    District Judge Marin decided to admit the recording, warning the father that such recordings sometimes backfire.  Miss Taylor did not apply for an order to prevent the father from making recordings. His assertion was untrue.  

 

I requested an addendum report from Dr. Wannan, which he kindly prepared over the weekend of 14th -15th December 2013, having listened to the two recordings.  [D123] In general, he is concerned about the recording of contact where this is not agreed, explicit and continuous.  It raises questions as to the children's knowledge that what they said might be used in the proceedings and whether they believe that they could share the information about being recorded with their mother. He noted that the father selects the recordings he relies on and contrasted this with notes of supervised contact which are made available to all the parties, whereas the father's approach to recording contact is unlikely to give this sort of rounded picture.  The recordings also raise the question of the father's level of perspective and Dr. Wannan notes: 

 

		"Despite the findings made against him and the advice offered to him, 			he is persisting in attempting to find evidence to criticise the mother 			
and her parenting abilities.  Rather than reflect on his own actions, and find a way forwards to a civil relationship with his ex-wife he appears to be using information that would seem, even to me who is not legally qualified, unlikely to persuade others of taking a favourable stance to him.  Sadly, it would seem more likely to be viewed negatively.  Rather than the father, who is an intelligent and articulate man, being seen to be pursuing a more holistic and child centred approach he has taken an overly specific and acrimonious one." [D124]

As regards the effect on the children Dr. Wannan notes: 	

 

"The more detailed an understanding the children have, the more likely it is that they will understand at some level that they are potentially being used to provide information that will play a role in the intra-parental acrimony.  This knowledge will not be pleasant for the children."

The father told me that since June 2013 he has not told the children that he was making the recordings so that they would not be stressed.  He assumes that they remain aware that he is recording them.  He told the children on 31st August 2013 that information they share with him may end up in court, they were entitled to pass on information to their mother and it works both ways.  

 
I return to the father's allegations.

22nd November 2013 - Father's allegation 1.

The mother says that this incident took place on 14th November 2013.  At almost 8 pm she reminded the children that they still needed to know whether C was going to his friend's birthday party that weekend, when he would be with the father.  The father said he could not discuss this with the children "because your mother has insisted on a court order to stop me discussing these things with you".  She was very upset that the father blamed her for C not being able to attend the party.  She asked A whether they could record this and A's response was: "I don't know."  That was the end of the exchange: there was no bullying or pressure.  She reacted instantly because the father was breaching the undertaking he had given not to discuss the proceedings with the children and he had lied.  She did not ask A to record the conversation: she had asked whether they could record it.  

 

Dr. Wannan listened to the recording and noted that not all of it was distinct.  There appeared to be something of an interview of A by the father asking why the mother had asked A to record something: "How did you feel about being asked to get involved? � get evidence against me �" A changed the subject to C and a party.

 

I listened to the recording but could not hear all of it. I heard the father say: "You know the other day... I heard your mother say: 'Record this, record this' what was she asking you to record?"  A replied that she was asking him to record the conversation because she thought it was not part of the court order; if the court said it should finish at 7.45 it should be recorded, or something like that.  The father asked: "How do you feel about getting involved in court, basically to get evidence against me?"  to which A replied: "I don't mind because I know I can't record it."  The father said that if it could be recorded it would be used in court as evidence against him, and I replied that his mother had said that C should go to the party.  It was difficult to make out any more.

 

The recording does not bear out the father's account of this incident.  It was not made during contact but is a recording of a conversation which the father tried to have with A nine days later, in which the father suggested what the mother had said.  The father's written submissions include (para. 78) a transcript of the recording of his conversation with A, which was not made available either to Dr. Wannan or to me.  I do not accept his assertion that the mother showed no insight into the effect of her actions or a degree of dishonesty in denying her actions in the face of clear evidence.  The evidence which the father created is far from clear and does not support his. I do not make the finding.

 


  	3 December 2013 - Father's Allegation 2

The father says that on this date in the course of indirect contact, A was upset because he had been unable to find his colouring pencils which he wanted to use in connection with his homework.  He asked his father if he knew where they were and they had a brief discussion about this.  The father said:

 

"I was amazed when, a few minutes later, the (mother) barged into the room and began aggressively and inappropriately berating A for asking me where his colouring pencils might be." 

He says this is a further example of the mother undermining his contact with the children, preventing the children from having proper homework interaction with him, and bullying the children.  He said: 	

 

"A was visibly upset by the mother's behaviour and he froze up not knowing what to say to me, so that even though we had been talking for a good 20 minutes by then, all he could manage to say to me was: 'So, how are you?'" [C275, para. 16]

The mother explained that some time before this call started A had asked her about his pencils and she said she had seen them and would look for them.  

 
A said that he would ask his dad where they were, but she told him not to do so because he would not know where they were.  As she was searching for them A talked to his father on the computer, in the same room.  She heard the father talking to A about the lost pencils, and was irritated because she felt that A did not appreciate her efforts. 

She accepted that she told A that he should not have asked his father where the pencils were because he had not lived in the house for over a year.  She did not think that she was aggressive, although she accepts that she was irritated.  She did not "barge" into any room but was looking for the pencils in the rooms where A brought the computer as he talked to the father.  When the phone call had finished they discussed what had happened. 

 

Dr. Wannan listened to the recording and noted that it began with the father speaking to B, much of which is "quite endearing", and that B had an exchange with C.  A then came into the recording looking for crayons/pens/pencils.  There is an interchange with the mother in the background, but this is not clear.  There is more discussion about homework.  B returned briefly.  

 

I listened to the recording and heard A ask his father whether he knew where the pencils might be.  I heard the mother say: "How would he know?  I've seen them.  There's no reason he should know, he hasn't been here in a year." She sounded irritated.  A then asked his father: "Anyway, how are you?" and their conversation continued for approximately 30 minutes. 

 

The father described the mother's intervention as "berating" A and told her: "You're a bully, you laid into him....that's the kind of person you are.  You laid into him. That's what you're always like, that's what A gets if he disagrees with you". 

 

The father invited Dr. Wannan's views of his account of this incident, before he disclosed the existence of the recording.  The father's account to 

 
Dr. Wannan was that the mother had said: "You have no right to ask your father.  How dare you ask your father?" which was not what I heard. 
Dr. Wannan said that he had never seen the mother aggressive or berating the children and he was hesitant to comment on something that seemed so out of character.  

The father suggested that the mother had made herself out to be somebody with insight who cares about her children, and had deceived Dr. Wannan.  

 
Dr. Wannan did not consider the mother to have been deceptive.  He agreed that, as an expert witness, it is vital that he remains open to new information and that he reconsider his opinion when appropriate.  But in view of the findings of fact made against the father, even if the father's allegation as put were true, in view of the many other pieces of information about the mother it would not fundamentally alter his opinion of her.  

This incident and Dr. Wannan's report having listened to the father's recording, form the basis for one of the father's complaints about Dr. Wannan.  In response to Dr. Wannan's comments that the interchange with the mother is not clear, the father asserts that it is "perfectly clear" and Dr. Wannan has either deliberately and dishonestly misled the court in claiming that the interchange is not clear or that he has failed to disclose an auditory impairment.  Even if Dr. Wannan could not make out what was being said, the tone of voice from the mother is abundantly clear.  Both recordings were made on the father's mobile phone, neither was entirely clear and A had to ask counsel and the father to clarify parts of them.  I do not accept the father's criticism of Dr. Wannan.

 

In his written submissions, the father sets out the exchange in a short transcript which was not available either to Dr. Wannan or to me, and which sets out more than I could make out from the recording.  The transcript, assuming it is correct, is not in the terms in which the father described it to Dr Wannan. The mother's intervention was brief and irritable, In my view she did not "berate" 

 
A, nor "lay into him" and was not abusive. The mother's intervention did not prevent the father and A from continuing a lengthy conversation.  The father's account to Dr Wannan was incorrect and his characterisation of the mother's behaviour is exaggerated. I do not make this finding.

28th November 2013 � Father's allegations 3 and 4.

The father alleges that B told him that she wanted help writing a script for a presentation she was giving at school about the singer Taylor Swift.  While they were discussing this, the mother told B that she was wasting time by talking to her father about these points, because the mother had already covered the same points with her.  The father accuses the mother of gross insensitivity and cites this as a further example of her undermining his contact with the children.  He says that B was visibly upset by the mother's behaviour and would in future be reluctant to ask him for help with homework over face time.  He suggests that the mother's comments were intended to achieve that aim. [C274, para. 13]

 

The mother says that she and B had spent the afternoon talking about B's speech.  By the time the father started talking to B it was past 8pm, B had not written her speech and said that she would write it at the father's home on the Saturday.  At 8pm when the father began to discuss this with B, she told B that it was a waste of time to discuss them again at that time.  The father ignored her and kept talking about what should go into the speech until about 8.15pm.  B was not visibly upset or, indeed, upset at all.  After the call she said that she did not feel able to stop her father talking about the project because she did not want to upset him. 

 

Dr. Wannan commented that if the indirect contact was about to finish he could understand that the mother might tell B that she was wasting time as a way of bringing the contact to an end.  He would not attach much weight, if any, to a parent telling a child not to waste time and did not agree with the father's characterisation of the mother.  He commented that on the basis of the father's allegation to describe the mother as "bullying, controlling and abusive" seemed to be taking a relatively small matter and making it into something much bigger.  I do not make this finding.

 

The father alleges that on the same day A told the mother that he wanted the father's help to design an entry for a competition and the mother told him to make sure that the father did not bully him or take it over, but to make sure it was his own work.  A told the mother that he was going to take a party invitation to show the father and she told him to make sure that he brought the invitation back because the father does not respond to texts.  The father characterises this as denigratory behaviour and alleges that the mother is determined to try to control A's interaction with him and limit his involvement in A's life.  

 

The mother says that she does not remember the incident.  She did not say to A: "Make sure he doesn't bully you", although she could imagine that she would have said: "Don't let him take it over, and make sure it's your own work" in the light of previous issues with A's homework. She did recall telling A that he could take a bar mitzvah invitation to his father's but he had to bring it back because the father does not answer texts, which the father has admitted.  

 

When this was put to Dr. Wannan he referred to his observation of the father's quite involved style with the children over their calligraphy work. He noted that he was aware that the father did not respond to the mother's texts, so that he could understand that she might have some anxiety on that score.  He agreed that for one parent to say to a child: "Make sure your father doesn't bully you and that you own your work" would be denigrating, though he could understand that mother being frustrated.  Compared to my findings, some of which are very serious, he considered this a relatively minor matter.  I do not make this finding.

 

 	Films

The father alleges that the mother tried to control his contact with the children when she learned that he was proposing to take B to see the film "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire".   He accuses the mother of hypocrisy, saying that she also watches 12 rated films with the children.  The mother said that she had seen the trailer for this film with B at the cinema.  It included a very short scene of a flogging, which upset B, who said that she thought that the father would take her to see the film, but she did not really want to see it because she was worried about the flogging.  The mother had to respond and said that she was also worried about B seeing this film. She reminded her that if she didn't want to see the film she should tell her father so.  She told me that the children started watching 12-rated films with her when A turned 12.  She has not said that the children should not watch 12-rated films with their father, her objection is to the children being scared.

 

Dr. Wannan commented that in his experience of this matter the mother has promoted contact despite the difficulties she has found with it.  It would not be consistent with her previous behaviour for her to set out to undermine contact.  Even if she told B that she was worried about her seeing the film, it was not the greatest offence in particular when compared with my findings.  

 

The Blast Furnace

The father alleges that the mother has tried to undermine his contact with A by objecting to his plan to build a blast furnace in the back garden with A.  A told the mother about this in September 2013 when he explained that he needed a pipe to pump air into the furnace and had spent some time sawing the top off a metal canister in preparation for this work.  They intended to use the 

 
home- made furnace to melt metals at a temperature of 1600C.  She was not happy about the safety aspects of using such a furnace in the back garden. [C235, para. 19]  Dr. Wannan commented that in view of the allegations of violence against the father, he could appreciate why an intention to build a blast furnace could give rise to a level of concern.  

The Children's Education  

The father considers that the children's education has suffered because they have not been able to spend sufficient time with him.  B has not read a single novel since he left the family home and C has told him that he only reads very occasionally with his mother.  He has been unable to help A with his piano practice and suggests that this is the reason why he failed his Grade 5 piano examination.

 

The mother says that the children have not suffered educationally as a result of spending less time with the father and this is supported by their school reports for the year ended July 2013.  A failed his Grade 5 exam a month after the father left the family home and was unlikely to pass given the conditions at home before the father left.

 

The father wishes to tutor B, in particular for the entrance exam for her first choice of secondary school.  The mother considers that B does not require tuition.  The parents had agreed that A would not be tutored for the entrance examination, the examination has changed and B is making very good progress.

 

The Father's New Approach.

In the course of his evidence, the father told me that he had re-read 

 
Dr. Wannan's report and on reflection, in the preceding 24 hours, he had decided to change his stance on communication with the mother.  His approach to these proceedings thus far has been the fault of the court system, by which he means Mrs. Lemonides who recommended the fact finding hearing and deliberately misconstrued evidence.  He was prepared to "retract, climb down" and communicate with the mother and had been thinking about how to implement a shared care plan.  It has always been his position that she is controlling and abusive of the children.  Her approach to the litigation has not been reasonable and she needs to climb down, too.

The father proposes that the court should make a shared residence order which would provide that the children would spend 60 per cent of their time with their mother during term time and the holidays would be shared equally.  By a shared care plan he means that he and the mother should try to identify outstanding issues, putting aside questions of residence and contact, and try to agree those issues either broadly or specifically.  

 


6  The Mother's Case.

The mother says that the orders and undertakings have not been effective to ensure that the father puts the children's interests first when he has contact with them, and at other times, and does not denigrate her to them.  He focuses on the literal meaning of the undertakings, such as the meaning of "discuss" and "supper", rather than their spirit.  He continues to denigrate her to and/or in the presence of the children.  The root of the problem is that the father has not succeeded in obtaining an order allowing him to bring the children back later than 7 pm.  Despite his agreeing "to feed the children supper before returning them at 7 pm", as recited in my order of 2nd August 2013, he has given them crisps and jaffa cakes, and cheese sandwiches, which they do not like.  When told to give the children a proper meal he has given them pasta or chicken and rice to eat in the car.  

 

The children told her, in August, that the father had talked to them about the judge's decision about the return time when he should not discuss the contact order with them. [C232, para. 9] She is also concerned that the father subsequently questioned the children when he realised that the conversation about the return time had found its way into the proceedings.

 

The mother is also concerned that the father continues to allow the children to go to bed very late when they stay at his mother's home at the weekend.  He does not respect the fact that the children need time with her at home at the weekend, and need to go to bed at a reasonable hour.  She notes that in his witness statement, dated 30th September 2013, [para. 6] the father refers to the return time as "arbitrary".  She suggests that his behaviour conveys the message: if you put controls on me, the children will suffer. 

 

The father uses the undertaking he gave not to discuss contact with the children, an excuse for not talking to them about contact activities to which they are invited and which they want to take part in.  He refused to discuss arrangements so that C could attend two parties. The father had previously complained that the children's piano playing has suffered because he was not there to encourage them but he did not allow them to take part in the concert organised by their piano teacher and refused to confirm either to the mother, or the piano teacher whether they could take part.   

 

The father suggests that the difficulty is in the court's order and the wording of his undertakings. With regard to the suggestion that he had discussed the contact return time with the children, the father said he explained to B and 

 
A that they could not be late back from contact and:

"It simply did not matter how upset they got or how much B cried but that I had to stick to the wording of the judgment even though there was no reason for having to stick to that particular minute of the day rather than any other time - it was simply an arbitrary minute in the day which had been picked as the time when I had to drop them with the mother." [C243, para. 6]

The children had difficulty understanding how the judgment could be concerned with the precise return time than with their happiness and at that point the father said: "In that case the Judgment seems stupid".  

A had blamed himself for the fact that the father's conversations with the children are being reported by the mother to the court.  He reassured A that he was free to tell anyone whatever he wanted and that they were in this position because of the court proceedings "� but that none of it mattered and everything would be better soon."  

 

I note that in the same witness statement the father asserts [para.11] that it is perfectly normal to have discussions with the children about what they are doing during their time with him and when and why.  

 

With regard to the children's meal before their return at the end of contact, the father challenged the assertion that he had agreed to give them supper, although it is recorded in the order of 2nd August 2013 and has not been appealed.  He told me that he does not know what "supper" means: it is an alien concept.  I pointed out that the order required him to give the children something substantial to eat before he returned them to their mother, whatever the meal was called.  The father said that he does feed the children properly, sometimes in the car which the children enjoy.  He complains that the children often eat later than 6 pm when with the mother, I note that then they are not constrained by the need to be somewhere else at 7 pm.  

 

With regard to the undertaking not to discuss contact with the children the father told me that the meaning was not clear and he was concerned that if he talked to the children about the parties or the piano concert, the mother would allege that he was in breach of his undertaking.  He thought a great deal about this but did not seek any advice. He had had an earlier conversation with 

 
C who had said some time ago that he would prefer to be with the father than go to a party and on this basis the father assumed that C would not wish to attend these two parties.  The children were anxious about the piano concert and therefore he decided that they should not attend, as he claims is his right when the children are with him.  He accepted that he did not respond to the mother's texts about these activities and said that he did not receive any communication from the piano teacher.  He rejected the suggestion that by refusing to communicate he had placed the children in the middle and blamed the mother for using them as messengers about these matters.   

The father accepted that on 3rd November 2013 he returned the children 30 minutes late and did not respond to the mother's texts.  He said that as he was driving he may not have heard the text tone, but then told me that the reason why he had not informed the mother that he would return the children late was that indirect contact had started 15 minutes late the week before without warning or explanation and he was annoyed.  He said: "She was unhelpful and I was unhelpful in return."  He was prepared to say "possibly I should have informed her".

 

Denigration.

I have found that the father has abused the mother to her face and in front of the children.  The mother considers that the father continues to denigrate her to the children.  The father denies this and I have noted that on 2nd August 2013 he refused to give an undertaking that he would not do so. 

 

The mother says that when the children returned from contact on Sunday, 3rd November 2013 they told her that C had become distressed with the father who said to him: "You're just like your mother".  C told the mother that he was upset because the father was being so mean about her. 

 

Subsequently, C told her that in the course of the same contact visit he had asked his father why he always refers to her as "your mother", explaining that when she talks about the father at home she calls him "dad" or "daddy".  The father then said that he would refer to the mother as "your uncle" and did so for the rest of the visit and subsequently. 

 

The father told me that referring to the mother as "your mother" is respectful in his culture and that calling her "your uncle" when C queried this, was a counter-factual joke. The mother's view is he is ridiculing of her to the children and therefore it is disrespectful of her and denigratory.

 

Dr Wannan advised that this matter of denigration is important.  He related it to the father's negative view of the mother and his abuse of her which formed the basis of my Finding 23. He said: it is upsetting for a parent to be denigrated by a former spouse.  It is damaging for the children because: 

 

 	(i)	it may take away some of their confidence and happiness in the care of the mother who is being vilified;

	(ii)	referring to the mother as "your uncle" could cause confusion, including about gender;

 	(iii)	In the long term, if the father's behaviour continues, the children may become uncertain about reality if they experience their mother as a warm, kind loving person but are told that what they receive from her is bad;  

	(iv)	Denigration can cause children to have split loyalties which they may manage by separating from one of their parents, a form of emotional defence.  

 	(v)	Denigration may set a child up to test out the other parent, by misbehaving, to see whether that parent really loves them.  

The father suggests that the mother's concern is based on a misunderstanding and she has taken his words out of context.  He offers an undertaking in terms that if the mother informs him of any words he has said to the children which she objects to, he will explain to the children that he did not intend to denigrate the mother and he will not repeat such words.  . 

 

Christmas Arrangements.

The mother is a practising Christian, who has been baptised and attends church with the children regularly.  The two younger children attend a Church of England school and at Christmas, which for the mother is one of the two central festivals of Christian faith, they attend a number of services and the children take part in nativity plays.  Christmas is also an opportunity for the children to spend time with their extended maternal family who do not gather together as often as the paternal family.  Christmas is important to the children and they expect to spend it with their mother. She respects the children's dual Christian/Islamic heritage and for that reason the children have been neither baptised nor confirmed.  In the course of these proceedings she has put forward proposals enabling the children to spend both Eid festivals with their father, she has not criticised his religious education of the children, nor has she denigrated his faith.  

 

The father objects to the children spending the whole of every Christmas with the mother.  They should spend part of it with him, because he has celebrated Christmas with them in the past, it is important to them and part of the culture in which they are being brought up. In addition, some members of his family are married to non-Muslims. He suggests that, if the children are to have a balanced cultural upbringing, it is vital that they understand and celebrate Jesus and Christmas from a British Islamic perspective.  The mother's proposal that the children can only celebrate Christmas with her is disrespectful. 

 

The Mother's View of the Father's New Approach.

The mother does not trust the father.  In the course of their marriage he promised to leave on two occasions but did not; throughout these proceedings he has called her a liar and an abuser and has accused her of bullying and mistreating the children.  His proposal that they reach an agreement "would be lovely if it were possible", but in her view the father wants everything agreed on his terms and she would rapidly find herself in court again.  He has recorded conversations with the children in order to gather "evidence which will be of assistance to the court in assessing the mother's character and the harmful things she does to the children." [C290]   This is not the behaviour of someone who genuinely and honestly wants to settle matters.  The mother points to other aspects of the father's recent conduct which cause her to doubt his sincerity.

 

Appeals. 

 The mother accepts that the father has a right to appeal any judgment or order in these proceedings, but says that his actions are also examples of his lack of insight into the impact of delay on her and the children.  

 




Council Tax.

I make no finding, nor am I asked to make any finding, in respect of this matter, but I refer to it because it is part of the explanation for the mother's distrust of the father.

 

At the hearing before District Judge Johns on 25th October 2012 the parties agreed that the family home would be sold and issues including the division of the net proceeds of sale would be the subject of negotiation or would be considered by the court.  The father agreed and undertook to leave the family home by 30th October 2012 and to continue to pay "the amenities" on it "as they fall due in full, until further order."

 

At the conclusion of the ancillary relief hearing on 19th April 2013 Deputy District Judge Hopkins ordered that the family home be sold and made consequential orders in relation to the conduct of the sale, the payment of costs and the division of the net proceeds of sale.  Paragraph 2 of her order provided that the father shall: 

 

"until completion of the sale of the property � continue to abide by his undertaking  given to the court on 25th October 2012, to pay the amenities on the former matrimonial home as they fall due."

Until the order was made in April 2013 the father paid the Council Tax (and other amenities/outgoings on the family home) out of joint funds.  On 26th November 2013 he wrote to the local authority requesting that they remove his name from the council tax account for the property and refund the payments he had made since he left the property.  He provided a copy of the order dated  25th October 2012 and confirmed that he left the property. The mother told me that the money which had been paid out of their joint funds until 19th April 2013 was reimbursed to the father's sole account.  She received demand notices for a total of �2,905.36.  

 

The father told me that he sent the local authority a copy of the first page of District Judge Johns' order.  District Judge Johns made two orders on 25th October 2012, one in the Children Act proceedings, and the other in the ancillary relief proceedings.  The orders overlap, but differ: the order made  in the ancillary relief proceedings recites the father's agreement and undertaking to continue to pay the amenities and the undertaking, signed by the father, is attached to it. The Children Act order makes no reference to it.  The father told me that he did not send the local authority the full order because they only asked for proof of the date on which he moved out.  He did not know whether he sent them the undertaking.  

 

Deputy District Judge Hopkins' order also recites the parties' agreement that the mother is entitled to retain a motor car as her own, and that the father shall deliver the certificate of registered keeper endorsed in her favour to her.  The father has refused to transfer the car to the mother.  He says that this provision of the order is also subject to his appeal, although it appears to have been made by consent.  

 

Child Maintenance. 

The father told me that he did not pay child maintenance until March 2013 because the mother did not make an application. He has recently cancelled the direct debit for child maintenance, and has paid less than the sum he was previously assessed to pay because he has reduced his work pattern from five to three days per week. 

 

The father accepts that his actions with regard to the Council Tax and child maintenance have an impact on the mother but asserts that he is within his rights.  He became angry as he said to Miss Taylor: "It may impact on your client and the children - it's not my problem.  If she doesn't like the fact that she can't get free money, it's her problem.  I do what I do in accordance with the law and it's all I can do."

 

Whatever the merits of the parents' respective positions, the mother is concerned about the impact of additional financial demands on her and on the children.  She has financed her legal representation whereas the father has represented himself at most of the hearings including the fact finding hearing and the final hearing.  She has no access to the capital tied up in the family home until it can be sold.

 

The Effects of the Litigation on the Mother.

In her witness statement dated 6th December 2013 the mother describes the effect of these proceedings on her.  She notes that the father has carried out his threats to withdraw financial support from her.  He has tried to distort events by portraying her as an abuser, and carried out his threat to apply for a residence order in respect of the children.  He pursued findings against her which had no merit and did not concede the findings which were made against him, which would have prevented the necessity of an eight day hearing.  He has appealed those findings. She adds: "Within the course of the proceedings 

 
I have had to endure being cross-examined by the father over incidents of violence and abuse.  I have been put in the position of showing information that the children have told me in confidence to ensure that the court and the professionals involved have complete insight into what the children are experiencing, despite the conflict this has caused me." [C267, paras.72 - 73]

The mother has found all of this extremely arduous, both emotionally and financially, whilst working full-time and working for three children.   

 

The Children's Health.

The mother is concerned that recently C had been showing signs of obsessive compulsive disorder, repeating words and actions until he gets them "just right".  This may have been triggered by stress but, as C has told her that he would like to talk to someone about it, she has spoken to his teacher and his doctor, both of whom have said that they can make a referral to the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services.   In the course of the hearing the father agreed to this referral.

 

7  Evidence of Mrs. Lemonides, CAFCASS Officer.

This part of my judgment should be read together with paras. 12-20 of my second judgment in which I refused the father's application that I disregard Mrs. Lemonides' evidence in its entirety.  I have now had an opportunity of hearing Mrs. Lemonides' evidence in full.

 

Mrs. Lemonides was a court welfare officer for 10 years and has worked as a family court adviser since 2001.  During that time she has undertaken further training, including in relation to domestic violence, she reads research and uses tools such as the Table of Risk and Benefit of Contact developed by 

 
Drs. Sturge and Glaser, as recommended by CAFCASS.  

As regards the process which led her to prepare two reports both dated 22nd July 2013 and the decision not to serve the second report on the parents, Mrs. Lemonides told me that in view of her conclusion that the father's contact should be suspended with immediate effect, she was concerned about the children who were due to have contact on the weekend of 24th July 2013. Her service manager decided that she should file separate reports. In 22 years she had never separated her analysis and recommendations into two reports

 

Mrs. Lemonides began her evidence on 1st October 2013 and concluded it on the first day of this hearing.  I decided that she should do so as though it were the beginning of October and, as a result, she did not read Dr. Wannan's report.  I was by then aware of the father's objections to Dr. Wannan's report and did not wish this factor to have any bearing on Mrs. Lemonides' evidence. 

 

In her report dated 25th March 2013 Mrs. Lemonides considered the children's wishes and feelings at length. She had met them separately.  C told her that he enjoyed playing with his cousins. He worried about his parents' arguing, although this has stopped since their father no longer came into the house.  He was worried about where they would live in the future.  He did not think his parents needed to change arrangements to make things better for him.  [D34/35]

 

Mrs. Lemonides used the CAFCASS workbook "How it Looks to Me" to discuss A's wishes and feelings.  He told her that contact was going well, he liked the contact arrangements as they were and enjoyed home life better since his parents separated.  He worries about what will happen with the family home and finds the court proceedings the most stressful aspect of his life.  Mrs Lemonides noted:  "He feels that his father uses (contact) as an opportunity to upset his mother" and gave as an example the father's purchase of an X-box and allowing the younger children to watch 12-rated movies. He worried about his parents arguing: even though they had stopped seeing each other face to face the arguments continue through emails and court proceedings.  He does not like his father returning them late from contact and explained that his father takes a flippant view of this (Mrs. Lemonides clarified that "flippant" was her word) being: "We can go back whenever we want."  He prefers to return at 7 pm to allow time to relax.  He was worried about his father constantly ringing him.    He indicated that he knew that his father might find it difficult that he was asserting his views.  He wanted contact to run smoothly and the court to make decisions about contact arrangements in the future.  [D35/36]

 

Mrs. Lemonides also used the CAFCASS workbook with B, who indicated that she felt more settled at home and said that she enjoyed spending time with her paternal family.  She said that her parents argue when her father comes to collect them but this has been resolved by his collecting them from school, although he was often late.  She was not happy that her father brought them late from contact. Her father had told them they can leave any time they like.  Her father sent texts to her mother which upset her and she wanted him to stop doing this saying: "If my mum's happy, I am happy."  B said that she had received texts from her father that upset her.  He had written: "If she's bullying you, you always have a voice."  He had said: "Mum lies and bullies me. It's not right, she doesn't bully me."  She expressed that if her father texts her she wants him to write "normal things".  She was worried about her father's response to her honesty and feared that he would shout at her, but she felt that it was important enough to express this so that he could make things better for them. [D36/37]

 

The father made A and B read this report and put pressure on them to write letters to the "court lady". [Finding 52]  

 

In first of her two reports dated 22nd July 2013 [D42] Mrs. Lemonides explained [para.19] that the children had previously told her that they were feeling anxious and stressed. She had advised in April 2013 that the parents needed to take heed of the children's expressed feelings which was: "clearly rejected by the father" (a reference to the incident which is the basis of my finding 51) and noted that the children will "inevitably also be aware of their mother's feelings and observe her feeling stressed and frustrated by the father's actions."  She did not interview the children again because she had interviewed them twice and they had made it clear that they wanted to live with their mother and have contact with their father.  A further interview would add further pressure. [Para.19]

 

Mrs. Lemonides was required to carry out a risk assessment if she had cause to suspect that the children were at risk of harm. [s16A Children Act 1989]. She noted that the father had demonstrated that he could behave in a bullying intimidating manner towards the children in the presence of the mother and expressed her concern that he presents a higher risk to the children when they are alone with him. She wondered what would happen when they displeased or challenged him, given that he had shown that he was unable consistently to sustain the prioritisation of their needs.  He did not take full responsibility for his behaviour, he refused to explore these issues and had not been assessed by professionals.  In her view my findings show that he has a limited ability to respond to all his children's needs and has shown that he has and continues to respond to them in a destructive, damaging way. [Para. 21]

 

Mrs. Lemonides' assessment of risk is informed by the report of Drs. Sturge and Glaser [2000] Fam Law 615.  In her view if contact were to continue with father making no changes, it would be likely to impact on the children in the following ways: 

 


It could escalate the climate of conflict around the children which would undermine their general stability and sense of emotional well-being. This could affect their relationships with both parents.  They might behave in unhealthy ways to meet their need to resolve the conflict.




It could expose the children to physical and emotional abuse by the father using contact as a means of continuing or escalating the "war" with the mother, for example, by engendering secrets and making derogatory remarks in an attempt to undermine her. 



It could cause further emotional abuse by increasing distortions in the children's perceptions and understanding of reality, for example when the father asserts that the mother is unreasonable in not allowing the children to come home from contact later than 7 pm.  Contact is not wholly child centred, but is also motivated by the father's need to get at the mother.




It would continue unhealthy, inappropriately dominant or bullying or controlling relationships, through subtly or blatantly maintaining or initiating fear, or through other means (for example, bribes, emotional blackmail).




It could undermine the children's sense of stability and continuity by deliberately or inadvertently setting different moral standards or standards of behaviour which could affect their understanding of right and wrong and give them the means to challenge or defy their mother. 



In order to reduce these risks the onus was on the father to demonstrate a willingness to make changes to his behaviour which would involve a much fuller acknowledgement and acceptance of his violence and its inappropriateness. She recommended that he complete a parenting programme and a Domestic Violence Intervention Project ("DVIP") perpetrator's programme before direct contact with the children is reinstated.  His refusal to do this work is evidence that he does not wish to deal with issues which have had an impact on the children, and is an example of him failing to put the children's long term interests first.

 

Mrs. Lemonides warns that there is a danger that: 

 

"� we could be drawn into minimising (the father's) actions in order to promote contact and his relationship with the children, particularly because contact is current and the children want it and love their father."

She recommended that the court should make final orders at the hearing then listed for 18th and 19th September 2013.  She advised that the mother should contact the DVIP women's services for assistance and support in decisions she makes in relation to contact and in communicating with the father. 

 

Mrs. Lemonides' second report, also dated 22nd July 2013 [D56] summarised and reiterated the views expressed in the longer report and set out her conclusion that contact should be suspended , at the hearing listed on 2nd August 2013.  The only contact she would consider as safe was indirect contact by way of emails and letters.  

 


Mrs. Lemonides attached to her second report a table headed: "Quick Reference Guide to CAFCASS Policy and Procedures" and "Court Guidelines on Domestic Violence and Benefits and Risks of Proposed Contact, Indicators and Contra-indicators."   This derives from the article by Drs. Sturge and Glaser published in Family Law in September 2000, and Mrs. Lemonides uses it to analyse evidence and her own observations in order to make recommendations to the court. 

 

In the father's written submissions which I considered in my second judgment, he described Mrs. Lemonides as "entirely unreliable and unprofessional" and unable to distinguish between facts and assumptions or opinions. In the written submissions which he provided after the final hearing, he repeated those concerns, with particular reference to the risk assessment table.  To give an example, he noted that in the section headed: "Indicators for Beneficial Contact" in response to the question: 

 

"Child would benefit from being special focus of love, attention and concern, and of loving and being concerned (needs realistic assessment of whether this would occur)"  

	Mrs. Lemonides "incorrectly" said: 

	"He has not shown that he has been able to focus on them on his own.  Children derive love, attention and concern from his family who are present with him during contact. "  

	The father says that when challenged, Mrs. Lemonides accepted that she knew when preparing her report that that statement was false because she knew that the father's family were not always present during contact.   On this basis the father accuses Mrs. Lemonides of knowingly misleading the court, which he describes as an issue of gross professional misconduct, if not contempt of court.  [Paras. 71-72 of the father's written submissions]

The father did not give a complete account either of Mrs. Lemonides' entry in the analysis table, or of her response to his question.  The complete entry includes the words: 

 

"... but father's concerns are more pre-occupied with getting back at the mother and showing the children he is a better parent to live with.  He has not shown he has been able to focus on them on his own.  Children derive love, attention and concern from his family who are present with him during contact."

	In response to his question Mrs. Lemonides said: 

	"What worries me is your behaviour and being preoccupied with the mother and undermining her parenting.  You told me the children were on their own with you.  When they were on their own with you, you chose to deal with an issue which you weren't happy about" (a reference to my Finding 51), and "In other words, issues you have overrode the children's experience of contact."

	She accepted that when she prepared her report he had told her that his family were not with him at all times during contact. 


It is clear that the father's family are present for much of the time during contact, indeed, that is one of the reasons why he suggests contact  should be increased.  Seen in context I consider that Mrs. Lemonides' response is valid whether the father spends all or some of his time alone with the children.  

 
I find that Mrs. Lemonides did not attempt to mislead the court (and I was not misled) and that this did not constitute gross professional misconduct or contempt of court.  

To take another example: the father alleges that Mrs. Lemonides accepted that she had "embellished her report" when she described the mountain as "dangerous".  [Finding 13]  Mrs. Lemonides did not accept the father's suggestion that she had embellished her report, on the contrary she said: "I do not think I have embellished my report".  

 

The father raises a question as to whether Mrs. Lemonides has been properly trained in the use of the risk assessment table and complains that her approach was inconsistent.  Mrs. Lemonides explained that the table is a tool which helps a family court adviser evaluate risk and in doing so she looked at evidence for and against beneficial contact. She has been using this analysis tool for some years, but recently CAFCASS officers have been encouraged to attach it to their reports.  The father's criticism of Mrs. Lemonides suggests that he believes that her analysis and conclusions are limited to my findings, whereas she is required to make her own observations and her own analysis, taking into account my findings but not limited to them.  

 

The father took Mrs Lemonides through the table, examining many of her entries in detail. She did not agree that she had completed it incorrectly.  In relation to an entry against the question: "Child has persistent and uninfluenced negative memories of the parent", Mrs. Lemonides wrote: "Children have experienced emotionally abusive unkind behaviour from father."  The father suggested to her that the children may not remember his behaviour and appeared to be suggesting that if the children did not remember the incidents which formed the basis of my findings, they would not have suffered.   Mrs. Lemonides was able to refer to my findings to support her view. She thought it likely that the children did remember at least some of what they had experienced.  This does not support the father's view that she did not understand the distinction between a memory and an experience.  

 

Mrs. Lemonides told me that she is aware that the children want to see their father, but she has to put their safety first and, in her view, the risk to them of harm from contact with their father is greater than any benefit they might derive from it.  Her recommendation that contact should be suspended is unusual but she considers that the risk to the children is high.  She is concerned about emotional harm to the children to the mother which could impact on her parenting capacity and about physical harm to the mother.  

 

Mrs. Lemonides has explained to my satisfaction the reasons for her filing two separate reports, both dated 22nd July 2013; she has explained how she used the analytical tool and why it was attached to her report, and how she qualified her responses to the questions set out in the table to reflect her concerns.  

 
I note that she was concerned about the allegations of domestic violence from the outset and proposed in October 2012 that there should be a fact finding hearing.  She has to take my findings into account in formulating her advice to the court. 

I found Mrs. Lemonides to be reasoned in her reports and measured in her oral evidence, in the face of detailed cross-examination by the father. She has highlighted the risk of minimising the father's actions in a case where he argues that my findings are either historic, and therefore irrelevant, or of no significance.   She has kept the children's needs clearly in mind, while acknowledging their wishes and feelings and made a difficult recommendation in the interests of their welfare. Her recommendation is supported by 

 
Dr. Wannan, who came to a different conclusion but said: "There is a reasonable case that the children should not have contact with their father". [D121]  

For all these reasons, I dismiss the father's application to disregard Mrs. Lemonides' evidence. 

 

8  The Evidence of Dr. Wannan.

Dr. Wannan, a Child and Adolescent psychiatrist, was jointly instructed by the parties as an expert to assess the children and the parents and provide a report, in accordance with the letter of instruction dated 8th October 2013.   His CV is at D123. He has been a member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists since 1998 and a consultant since 2002.  He works full-time in the NHS and prepares reports as part of the multi-disciplinary team at Parkside Clinic, which is run in collaboration with the NSPCC.  Most of this work relates to public law proceedings where there are child protection concerns.  He also trains and supervises others outside his team in the preparation of court reports.  In addition to his NHS practice he undertakes some independent work and produces approximately 10 reports each year in relation to public and private family law matters.  He has "particular experience in contact disputes where there is intractable hostility between parents." 

 

The letter of instruction to Dr. Wannan, to which both parents contributed and which I reviewed, included requests to: consider whether any of the children suffer from psychological or psychiatric conditions, and comment upon any harm which any of them may have suffered in respect of psychological intellectual, educational, emotional, social and behavioural development and assess the cause of any such harm. [D83]

 

Approach.

Dr. Wannan concentrated on themes and what he considered to be relevant detail [D84].  Where some of the questions, such as the assessments of the children, could be interpreted as suggesting a very considerable assessment he  interpreted them in a more general way and did not subject the children to a more in depth or prolonged series of meetings with him.  Where information was readily available he did not wish to probe the children over upsetting matters, such as domestic violence, unless he thought it was specifically necessary in order to come to the conclusions in his report. [D84, para. 5]

 

He found both the parents and children, amenable in terms of arranging appointments with them.  He liaised with the children's school and met the paternal grandmother.  He met the father three times and observed his contact with the children.  He met the mother twice, and observed the children with her.

 

Themes

The father's approach to the findings:

Dr. Wannan encouraged the father to reflect on matters that it is within his power to change and spoke about his approach to the judgment following the fact finding hearing, the use of interventions such as the DVIP and the possibility of changing his application so that the proceedings could become less acrimonious.  The father explained that the family justice system is disorganised and incompetent, the DVIP is incompetent, the Judge had spoken about the balance of probabilities but had failed to make a finding in his favour to the effect that he was abused, and that the mother is a liar.  He had changed himself, without attending the DVIP.  

 

When Dr. Wannan raised the subject with the father of his appearing relatively isolated in the stance he was taking in court, and whether this had ever suggested to him that he might be misguided in his positions, the father explained that there had been things that he should not have done but he has moved on and would not repeat his mistakes.  

 

Routines.

When Dr. Wannan suggested to the father that, in view of the uncertainties and difficulties the children had experienced in their lives, it may be that they would benefit from routine and certainty, in particular consistent routine between their parents' homes.  The father said that he had made up his mind about this matter. 

 

Communication with the mother.

Dr. Wannan raised the incident when the father had returned the children half an hour late after contact on 31st October 2013, without letting the mother know when they would be back.  The father explained that it had been necessary to calm C down before returning the children to the mother, and that he did not inform the mother of the position because he did not like communicating with her, her lies undermine him, he would never communicate with her again.  After some discussion he said that he would communicate with the mother by letter and if he were late returning the children he would ask A to contact the mother. 

 

The Father's approach to these proceedings.

The father told Dr. Wannan that the proceedings will not stop. [D91,para. 32]  While the mother criticises him he has to make allegations against her. [D95, para 43]   There would always be proceedings ongoing in relation to the children and he would not give up unless the mother stopped making allegations, as otherwise he would feel exposed. [D97, para.49]

 

Observation of Contact.

Dr. Wannan observed the children with their father at the father's home.  He had suggested that the father organise an activity and he had organised calligraphy. Dr. Wannan told me that the session was largely instructional. He noted that: 

 

"Although clearly interested in his children and apparently wishing to assist me in the assessment, the father took a somewhat controlling and uni-directional approach to them, showing less emotion and attunement than might be hoped for, although he did begin to warm up somewhat as the session progressed. ..  The father ... gave them very specific instructions as to how they should write and draw.  A, whom I had always seen as calm and compliant in his dealings, became exasperated with his father's instructions and said: 'Alright!'." [D97, para.51]

He noted some positive aspects of the father's interaction with the children, including praising B for her drawing of a bird, and stroking C's hair.

Dr. Wannan would have hoped for a more "flexible and child orientated approach" from the father.  [D98, para. 53] When the father explained that the children asked him to teach them calligraphy and enjoy it, Dr Wannan told me: "Now I understand how this came about, but it does not change my view".

 

Dr. Wannan also met the father's mother whom he found to be emotionally warm, thoughtful and very child orientated.  She said with some regret that she does not communicate with the mother these days.

 

Dr. Wannan told the father some of his concerns and explained that it was unlikely that he would recommend a shared residence order. He suggested that choices, including accepting the judgment and varying his application, remained open to him.  

 

Dr. Wannan's Impressions of the Father.

Dr. Wannan was aware that he may not have seen the father at the best time in his life due to the divorce, the restrictive contact with his children, and the difficulties he had experienced at work, and noted that, at happier times, he may have been able to be more spontaneous, creative and lateral in his thinking as well as in his interaction with the children. Nevertheless he set out a number of concerns.

 

In general the father's view of matters is that the judge, the mother and the CAFCASS officer are all very largely wrong and he does not need assistance with matters, saying instead that he has resolved what had been minimal issues. 

 

"Whereas there has been considerable concern in court that the father has been abusive to the mother, as well as to the children he has taken the diametric position that he has been the one abused, including by the mother and also by the court, effectively driving a wedge between the separated couple."[D99, para 58]

Dr. Wannan noted that if the father could simply acknowledge straightforward matters such as texting over a late arrival time, or instigating an agreed bedtime plan between the houses, not only would this be very much in the children's best interests, it would also promote civil communication with the mother. [D99-100, para. 58]   However, the father's mindset has made an agreement such as this unrealistic and that there are several ways in which his thinking has impeded progress.  Rather than reflecting more on the mistakes he has made and what is within his power to positively change, he has construed matters in such a way in his mind that people around him are against him, often through their incompetence or victimisation of him, including being lied to and abused. 

 

Other concerns include:

 


The father's lack of insight. The incident of him holding the knife to the mother's throat [Finding 5] and it being witnessed by a child has not 	made him realise that the mother and children are likely to be frightened of him doing this again in the future.  




In his experience "it would be very unusual for a person to commit such an act as this and, solely on the basis of internal resources, find a way to sufficiently ensure that violence does not take place again." [D101, para 61]



The father appeared to find it difficult to consider matters from the children's perspective. 



The Mother.

Dr. Wannan found the mother to be pleasant, organised and child focused, with a "relatively high capacity for insight".  He was concerned about her failure to report the knife (to the throat) incident and suggested to her that this had effectively been abusive to the children and very likely led to a delay in matters being resolved, that court orders or threats in general are "toothless without consequences."  She was able to acknowledge this. 

 

She told him that things had been better since there had been a greater defining of contact but she still had a considerable number of concerns was also concerned about the cumulative effect on the children of the stresses they have endured.

 

She considers that the best outcome for the children would be for them to live with her and be happy at contact every second weekend and one weeknight with the father.  She hoped for a civil relationship with the father.  The worst outcome would be the children not being allowed to see the father, although potentially it could be for the best.  She would like advice as to what is best for the children. 

 

Dr. Wannan observed the mother and the children undertaking a group activity: a group painting using a roll of blank wallpaper and assorted paint. He noted that the children looked happy and interested, and there was a large amount of appropriate organisation, interactions between family members felt naturally emotionally warm and positive, including C cuddling his mother.  The mother used many encouraging comments. 

 

Impressions of the Mother.

The mother presented to Dr. Wannan as: 

 

"� a caring and committed parent who is thoughtful about her children.  She has what would appear an increasing capacity to have insight into the situation, has reflected on matters and made use of professional support and advice which, in my opinion, has worked to promote the children's welfare." [D107, para 84]
	
 	He added: 

	"It appears that the mother has taken an undue and misguided level of responsibility for others in her thinking and rather than let the appropriate consequences happen, she has chosen to take the inappropriate responsibility of trying to please everybody by juggling conflicting demands and expectations." [D107, para. 84] 	

Despite his concerns, Dr. Wannan noted: "considerable evidence of good parenting" and said that at the observed contact it was: 

 

"� a pleasure to see how well the mother stimulated the children, balanced their different needs and also maintained a calm and orderly environment." [D107, para85]

Meetings with the children/their wishes and feelings.

Dr. Wannan talked to the children together, but separately from the mother.  They told him that they sometimes discussed the difficulties there had been.  After some discussion they agreed that contact is better when their cousins did not come and they were able to spend more time with the father.  They said that when they are left to play with their cousins, the father speaks with the adults.  Dr. Wannan met A, B and C separately at his clinic.  

 

"A".

Although initially shy, A became more and more forthcoming as the interview progressed.  They talked about the contact which Dr. Wannan had observed at the father's and A explained that his father is into calligraphy and accurately drew the figures that he and his siblings would be expected to reproduce. 

 

A agreed that his father is a very important person in his life.  He said of his mother: "She is very capable, but she does worry", and talked about some of her current worries.  He does not like to see her upset. 

 

A raised the problem of late bedtime during contact and said that the father has attempted to persuade them over the amount of contact they have with him, saying that earlier bedtimes would only be realistic if they had more time with him during the week.  A feels that the current arrangements are a "good amount of contact".  He was not sure if midweek contact with his father would lead to a timely arrival at school. The father does not understand that there are things the children want to do with the mother at the weekend and he was also concerned about having sufficient structure at his father's to enable the completion of homework.  Phone calls with his father are better as they are less frequent.  

 

Dr Wannan noted that: 

 

"A was also pleased that his father appeared to be winding-up his mother less, but gave the example that when he was speaking to his mother to explain that they would be late back from the cousins in Farnham, his father deliberately put the music volume up in order to make it difficult for mother and son to speak.  The father justified this as the mother had stopped the telephone calls between him and the children earlier this year." [D110, para. 93]   

The father told me that this incident had occurred early in 2013 but it seems that A did not tell Dr. Wannan this. 

Presently, A feels okay, life is good.  He feels easy and relaxed and there is nothing to worry about. A's head of year at school told Dr. Wannan that he is doing well and there are no concerns about him.  

 

Dr. Wannan formed the impression that A: 

 

"� is a delightful, articulate, interesting and interested young man, who found it relatively easy to discuss matters in some depth for over 40 minutes in a rather adult fashion." 

and who has good perspective over the actions of those around him.  However, Dr. Wannan also noted that the responsibility and anxiety for his family that he would expect A to take on as the eldest child appeared to be exaggerated, and he suspected that A has been "prematurely adultified" in terms of his emotions and thinking about his life experiences. He suspects that A has been very aware of the upset and distress his mother has experienced and may be hesitant in talking to her about things that concern him. He would be assisted by a civil relationship between his parents and the end of these proceedings. A is likely to benefit from some type of talking help. [D111, para. 99]

"B".

B spoke about school and her teachers.  She chose to do some drawing and Dr. Wannan noted that the quality of her work was excellent.  She spontaneously put her family's names, including "dad" on the picture.  When they spoke about contact B said that she does want to see her father.  There are some problems, but she did not want to speak further about them.   Contact can go well, and does more often now.  She wants to stay living where she is.  [D112, para 102]

 

Dr. Wannan had the impression that B was a delightful child ... who smiled,  lovely social interaction and appeared at ease in adult company.  Her spontaneously putting her father's title on her drawing suggests indirectly that he is an important figure in her life and that she sees him as a definite part of her family and of her identity.  A prompt resolution of the issues he had highlighted could only be good for her in terms of her emotional health.  

 

The head teacher at B's school explained that both B and C present as well cared for, and both appear happy to come to school and be at school.  There are no significant behavioural issues, they are making good academic progress and are often in top groups. 

 

"C".

C presented as a sturdy boy who was clear in his manner but had a cute and mischievous smile.  He appeared interested to check Dr. Wannan out and work out how much he should or should not say to him.   C was clear that though he wanted to see his father there were problems sometimes, although fewer than there had been previously.  

 

Dr. Wannan found C a delightful child to be with, who appeared more confident and emotionally open than his siblings but who is, like them, clever and able in many respects.  C's play and drawings suggested that he is sending a message to the adults in his life that he wants them all to be able to get on.

 

Analysis 

Dr. Wannan noted consistent themes that emerged from the considerable amount of information he had to analyse.  He said: 

 

"It is my opinion that the children are still being harmed by the inter-parental acrimony:  I am particularly concerned over aspects of the historical facts, such as the father putting a knife to the mother's throat, as well as future scenarios that include the not unlikely prospect of inadequate communication between the parents, and contact arrangements and the like returning repeatedly to court." [D115, para. 112]  

He noted that the parents are taking different approaches to learning from the past, prioritising the children's needs and focusing on what they could now do differently. The father's position does not appear flexible: "not only has he not grasped the consequences of his previous actions and remedial action that is required, he has prioritised his own feelings and sense of injustice above the children's needs." And: "despite opportunities to use the experience and thinking of a variety of sources, he has not used these."  

 

There are some very simple matters that the father could change, such as: agreeing to text his children's mother over their children's immediate care and by doing so he would lessen any allegations that might be made that he is prioritising his pride.  However, if the father should be intransigent in his position then Dr Wannan is pessimistic about the future because: 

 

"intractable hostility and prolonged proceedings, especially if the mother does not follow through with fully protecting the children, to the best of her ability, is likely to lead to further harm to these three children."

Dr. Wannan noted: 

 

"As is evidenced through the breaching of court orders by the father ... the father is not subjecting himself appropriately to boundaries placed on him.  Being legally qualified, I am sure this comes not from ignorance, and may instead suggest more general difficulties in submitting to authority." [D117, para.115]

By contrast, the mother's insight and her determination to protect the children, especially after her discussions with Dr Wannan, seem to be increasing.

 

He noted that each of the children was clear that they wanted contact with their father but each in their own way, including in their accounts to Mrs Lemonides, demonstrated their concerns over contact, although there was acknowledgement that the current arrangements were superior to those previously.  He suspects that it is particularly upsetting for the children to see their mother upset by the father's actions and their conflict of loyalties will be heightened by the father denigrating the mother in their presence. [D117, para.116]

 

Dr. Wannan found that "Each (child) has not been so emotionally damaged as to show a significant level of distress at school" which, in his opinion, is encouraging.  However, he is concerned at the harm perpetrated against them having witnessed domestic violence, and more persistently having been exposed to the father's apparent attempts to undermine the mother and the court, thereby not prioritising their welfare.  

 

Recommendations.

Dr. Wannan recommends that the mother remains the children's main carer.  She has parented them well and is supportive and flexible; she has not undermined the father's contact; she has the children's interests in mind. In view of the level of harm perpetrated by the father, the stability of a primary, permanent residence with the mother is likely to be better for the children.

 

The father's capacity to care for the children is uncertain.  Dr. Wannan hopes that he is able to gain increased perspective and appreciate he needs to clearly place the children's needs above his own.  The change he requires to make to more fully safeguard his children is more considerable than that which the mother needs to make, as she has demonstrated a high and increasing capacity to safeguard the children now and into the future.  She must be prepared to enforce the court's orders.

 

In his report, Dr. Wannan discussed contact in detail.  He noted that having had a considerable amount of good parenting, no doubt some of it from the father, will have made the children more resilient and therefore more able to manage the rough and smooth of paternal contact, especially as there have been improvements.  However, the father has continued with an intransigent stance.  The children desperately want to see their father but a significant part of them is wary about contact.  He was particularly concerned that B said (to Mrs. Lemonides) that she is concerned she will get into trouble if she criticises her father to professionals which is likely to make contact less safe.  He notes that the father appears to have been more respectful of boundaries placed on him, the more restrictive the court orders have become, which could be an argument in favour of further restriction of contact until he is able to demonstrate appropriate compliance.

 

Direct contact has both advantages and disadvantages for the children but on balance the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, even allowing for the father's inappropriate behaviour.  He noted that it would be a considerable wrench for the children to be denied paternal contact but supervision of contact, either by professionals or by the paternal family, is not a realistic option. In view of this, if the father, does not comply with orders or if he gives the children inappropriate information or continues to denigrate the mother, then it should be possible to terminate direct contact.[D120, para 123] The mother has promoted contact and if she were to decide to stop it, it is unlikely that she would do so prematurely or without careful thought.

 

If contact were suspended, Dr. Wannan imagined that all the children would be upset, although there may be some feelings of relief for the children.  He noted that it is very likely that the children are concerned about their father and are likely, even if contact has its challenges, to be reassured by seeing him.  He also thinks it possible that A would find his own ways of having contact with his father if contact were suspended and might become even more a messenger between the father and the younger children.  

 

Dr. Wannan observed that there is a considerable case that the children should not have contact with the father until he has demonstrated an appropriate change in his stance.  But, for the reasons he outlined including the children's wishes, contact should continue, albeit on a decreased and reviewable basis. 

 

He recommends direct contact fortnightly, on a weekend day, from 10am to 5 pm.  This would be a substantial reduction from the current level of contact but Dr Wannan told me that he does not think it is good for the children to spend an excessive amount of time with the father.  Contact should be reviewed so that the father can demonstrate compliance i.e. that he does not persistently bring the children back late; does not give them inappropriate information and does not denigrate the mother to them.  If the father does not comply with these requirements, there could be a sufficient case for contact to cease.

 

He recommends indirect contact on religious festivals and birthdays. The parents could agree to additional indirect contact. 

 

Dr. Wannan initially recommended a further review of contact but he told me that he could see advantages of conclusion and clarity as repeated returns to court are harmful to children, they distract the parents, cause stress and drain finances.

 

He recommends that the parents conclude legal matters in as clear and as civil a way as possible, ideally leading to a position where they can work together effectively to promote their children's welfare.   The father should consider taking a less adversarial approach along the lines suggested.  By contrast, the mother should consider a greater follow-through of court orders.  She will benefit from continuing counselling. 

 

The father should reconsider the use of DVIP and complete a relevant course.  He should consider approaching his GP and requesting a psychiatric assessment to exclude the possibility of undiagnosed mental illness.  

 

The Father's Application to Disregard Dr. Wannan's Evidence.

In his application to disregard Dr. Wannan's evidence, both written and oral, the father asserted that "Dr. Wannan has acted in manner that amounts to professional misconduct and that he deliberately and selectively edited information such as to deceive the father and the court.

 

In Meadow v General Medical Council (Her Majesty's Attorney-General Intervening) [2006] EWCA Civ 1390[2007] 1 FLR 1398 the Court of Appeal defined serious professional misconduct and noted that it might include "acts of bad faith or other moral turpitude ... incompetence or negligence of a high degree.... purporting to act or speak in an expert capacity, while going outside the area of expertise."  Whether such conduct amounted to 'serious professional misconduct' would depend on the circumstances and ...only rarely would a person be held to be guilty of serious professional misconduct in the absence of bad faith.  Where the relevant conduct of an expert arose out of evidence given to a court ..., it was important that the body fully understood and assessed that conduct in the forensic context. Of great importance were the circumstances in which the expert came to give the evidence, the way in which it was given, and the potential effect, if any, it had on the proceedings and their outcome." 

 

The father alleges that Dr. Wannan acted in bad faith by knowingly lying to the court with the intention of misleading the court.  He asks the court to refer Dr. Wannan to the General Medical Council, failing which he will do so.  He notes that if his complaint is upheld Dr. Wannan will have been unfit to practise as a doctor at the time he gave evidence. The father's complaints take up 15 pages of his final submissions. I will consider those which I consider the most serious, although all are serious.  

 

	(i)  	Dr. Wannan copied sections of Mrs. Lemonides' report and re-arranged them in such a way as to deliberately misrepresent the father. 

In his report, under the heading "Background" Dr. Wannan summarised information contained in the documents he had read, including my first judgment.  In the section about the father, Dr. Wannan set out his background and referred to the findings that I made against him and to Mrs. Lemonides' reports [D86, paras 11 and 12]   

 

The father alleges that Dr Wannan "copied sections of Mrs. Lemonides report and re-arranged them in such a way as to deliberately misrepresent" what the father said. [Father's written submissions, para 41] The part of Dr. Wannan's report he refers to clearly contains a summary of comments contained in paras. 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13 of Mrs. Lemonides' report, dated 22nd July 2013 [D42 onwards], which were familiar to me from my earlier reading of her report. It forms part of the background and introduction to Dr Wannan's report on his work with the parents and the children, his analysis and conclusions.  It is common practice for experts to preface their work in this way, but the father, who is in person, may not have been aware of this. I do not accept this criticism.

 

 	(ii)	Dr. Wannan gave evidence about observing contact with the father when they were practising calligraphy when he did not understand anything about calligraphy.

I have referred to Dr. Wannan's observation of the children with their father and his comments on the father's parenting style in paras 156-7 of this judgment.  He noted positive aspects of the calligraphy session, the father complimenting B and stroking C's hair but concluded: 

 

"� even allowing for the stress of a visit from a relative stranger, and being observed, I would have hoped for a more flexible and child orientated approach from their father." [D98, para.53]  

The father's criticism of Dr. Wannan, which he also put in the course of his cross-examination, is that whereas he has considerable knowledge of calligraphy, Dr. Wannan knows little about it and is therefore: "not qualified to use (this) as the basis of his evidence." 

 

The father's criticism misses the point.  Dr. Wannan had asked him to arrange an activity which he could observe and he chose to give the children a lesson in calligraphy. It seems to me that the father cannot reasonably complain when Dr. Wannan comments on his observations of the activity which the father chose to demonstrate his contact with the children.  When the father challenged Dr. Wannan, he said that understanding how the calligraphy lesson had come about did not alter his views. Dr. Wannan's comments included positives and negatives and I found them to be balanced and fair.  I do not accept this criticism.

 

 	(iii)	The father suggests that Dr. Wannan may have an auditory impairment which he should have declared to the court.  Alternatively he failed to have regard to material facts or he deliberately lied to the court when he said that what the mother said in the recording which the father made of his indirect contact with A was not clear. 

I have considered this criticism when I reviewed the father's recording of the children during contact and Dr. Wannan's report at paras 46 and 51of this judgment.  I do not accept it.

 

 	(iv)	Dr. Wannan's description of the impact of the children of domestic violence. 

The father claims that Dr. Wannan said that there was no evidence of any impact on the children on any of the historic events mentioned in his report.  The most he could say was that he would be surprised if there was no impact.

 

By "historic events", from the context of his complaint, the father has in mind my findings of his violence to the mother. (Findings 3, 5 and 16 and 17)  In his complaint the father reiterates his "repeatedly stated" assertion that many of the allegations made by the mother are minimal and historic and should never have been considered by the court at all.  He may, therefore, have in mind other findings.

 

Dr. Wannan's summary of the findings I made is set out at para. 11 [D86] of his report.  He identifies that the father was found to be abusive to the mother and the children; in addition to the physical violence he had threatened the mother and had emotionally abused her by her calling her names; he had acted in a variety of controlling and aggressive ways to each of the children, and had been emotionally abusive to them by giving them inappropriate information, being abusive to their mother in their presence, and telling them to say or do demeaning things.

 

This summary sets out Dr. Wannan's understanding of the findings which formed the background to his inquiries. Dr. Wannan noted that I had found that the father loves the children and they love him, but that I had been concerned at the father's overly direct interventions with the children, including what he had said to them, and that in my opinion often the ends would justify the non-child centred means which he used, often appearing more concerned with his own feelings rather than the children's.  This understanding formed the background to Dr. Wannan's assessment.  

 

I have set out Dr. Wannan's concerns for the children at paragraph 164 of this judgment but it is worth noting here his reference to "...  the harm perpetrated against them having witnessed domestic violence and more persistently been exposed to the father's apparent attempts to undermine the mother and the court, thereby not prioritising their welfare."  All the children had experienced harm and : 

 

"Experience would suggest that domestic violence is a particular source of harm, and some of the children's communication did suggest their knowledge of this."  

It is, therefore, not correct, as the father asserts, that Dr. Wannan said there was no evidence of any impact on the children of any of the historic events mentioned in his report.  When cross-examined by the father, Dr. Wannan said, with reference to the "knife incident" (Allegation 5): 

 

"In terms of level of violence it is one of the most significant findings.  It would be significant even if the children had not seen it.  That level of violence is very significant."

 The father suggested to Dr. Wannan that there was no evidence of any impact of domestic violence or other abuse on the children, and Dr. Wannan replied: "In view of the findings of fact as to what the children have seen and heard, even a lay person would be very surprised if there were no impact on them."

 

Dr Wannan had considered the situation both historically and currently.  In his report, he makes it clear that the children have benefitted from some good parenting.  He notes that they present well at school but that does not detract from his view that the children have suffered harm as a result of their experiences both of the matters as to which I have made findings and because of the continuing inter-parental acrimony. I do not accept the Father's criticism.

 

 	(v)	Dr. Wannan's incorrect use of the term "emotional abuse".

Dr. Wannan makes several references to emotional abuse in his report (as the father notes) and also refers to "ongoing emotional abuse"  [D120, para 122] The father describes this reference as "startling", but it follows from Dr. Wannan's earlier opinion, under the heading: "Analysis": "It is my opinion that the children are still being harmed by the inter-parental acrimony." [para. 112]

 

During his cross-examination of Dr. Wannan the father asked him for a definition of "emotional abuse".  Dr. Wannan said that, with warning, he would have brought a definition to court.  He said: "It is a more complicated form of abuse to define.  It would involve actions of care givers of children who often purposefully or accidentally cause undue, unnecessary distress in a child."

 

The father asked: "Is that your own definition that you've just come up with?"  I reminded the father that Dr. Wannan was giving evidence as a jointly instructed expert child and adolescent psychiatrist and that he had therefore accepted Dr. Wannan's expertise and experience, as set out in his CV.  

 

Dr. Wannan said that there are well accepted definitions of emotional abuse, but he does not carry them around in his mind and had spoken from his experience. The father then attempted to test Dr. Wannan's definition of emotional abuse by asking his opinion about a situation in which an adult popped a balloon behind a child which he suggested came within Dr. Wannan's definition. Dr. Wannan pointed to examples from my findings of the father's behaviour which he said was emotionally abusive, threatening the mother (Finding 5), calling her names (Finding 23) giving the children inappropriate information, (Finding 7a) and telling the children about the mother's solicitor's letter (Finding 9).  It was in this context that he agreed that in some circumstances bursting a balloon behind a child could be abusive.

 

In the course of the father's cross-examination of Dr. Wannan it became clear that the father considered that Dr. Wannan's opinions should be limited by my findings.  This approach is apparent from para. 50 of the father's submissions where he suggests that because the expression "ongoing emotional abuse" is not in my first judgment,  Dr. Wannan has to justify his words by relying on a definition of emotional abuse. As an expert, Dr. Wannan is required to give his opinion about the significance of those findings and their effect, or likely effect, on the children, taking into account his own observations and analysis and based on his experience and expertise.

 

Dr. Wannan did not say in the course of his evidence that, in carrying out his assessment, he relied on a definition of emotional abuse which is not widely accepted, as the father asserts.  He was clearly aware of other, longer, more comprehensive definitions but had not memorised them.  There is no evidence and I do not accept, as the father asserts in para. 53 of his submissions, that Dr. Wannan relied on a definition that is not supported by peer review or widely used by his colleagues.  He produced in court, without notice, a short definition while making it clear that he was aware of other longer, more comprehensive definitions. That there are other definitions is clear, but the fact that Dr. Wannan could not produce one, without notice, does not in my view detract from his assessment in this case.

 

I find that the father has tried to elevate a short section of cross-examination into a critique of Dr. Wannan's experience, the work he did in order to carry out his assessment, his report and his oral evidence in a way which is entirely unjustified.

 

This section of the father's criticism of Dr. Wannan also includes an allegation (at para. 54) of "bias towards the mother").  Dr. Wannan notes both positive and negative aspects of each parent's care of the children.  He supported his recommendation that she should continue to be the children's primary carer with a detailed analysis of both parents. In my view there is no evidence that he has been biased towards her in his approach to or his preparation of his report.

 

 	(vi)	Dr. Wannan's factual errors and his failure to revise his findings when these were corrected and fabricating a finding against the father.

In the course of the father's cross-examination of Dr. Wannan, he pointed out some factual errors, e.g.  Dr. Wannan had said that the mother received support from the DVIP in 2008, whereas, in fact, this was in 2010 [Judgment 1, para. 20]  Dr. Wannan said that he was happy to correct errors if they are pointed out to him.  He accepted a correction to his summary of my findings and corrected it. These corrections did not alter his opinions.

 

This forms the basis of the father's allegation that Dr. Wannan fabricated a finding against him.  Having read the report and having heard Dr. Wannan's frank admission that when reading a great deal of documentation it is possible to make a mistake, which he corrected, I accept that this was a genuine error.  

 

Similarly, the father alleges that at para. 23 of his report Dr. Wannan incorrectly said of B that she: "Fears that her father will shout at her though in view of her honesty".  This comment originates with Mrs. Lemonides in her report dated 25th March 2013. [D37]  The letter which B wrote to the "court lady" is the subject of my finding 52. In framing this criticism of Dr. Wannan the father ignores the substance of the finding which I made against him. 

 

The father alleges a further factual error made by Dr. Wannan, namely that he "incorrectly recorded whether the children had witnessed any domestic violence, and made a big issue of this in para. 61 of his report."  Paragraph 61 of Dr. Wannan's report highlights the father's lack of insight and gives as an example the incident of the knife to the throat.  I found that the father forced the mother down the stairs at knifepoint in front of C.  Dr. Wannan did not say that this was insignificant.  He said that it would have been significant even if the children had not seen it and that level of violence is very significant.   

 


I have noted that the father told me that on re-reading Dr. Wannan's report he had decided to take a difference stance in the proceedings and put forward a more conciliatory approach, which somewhat undermines his criticisms.

 

There is nothing to suggest that Dr Wannan was anything less than fair to the father: he acknowledged that he may not have seen him at the best time in his life and took into account the considerable amount of stress for the father. [D99, para. 57]  He discussed his impressions with the father and encouraged him to take a different approach.  He carefully balanced the children's wish to spend time with their father with the need to reduce some of the harmful aspects of contact. [D118, para. 118] I find that Dr. Wannan has carried out a difficult piece of work with great care and skill. His report demonstrates familiarity with the most important issues and events, accurate observation and a careful and thorough analysis.  He gave his evidence in court in a calm, professional manner and provided a full explanation for his opinions and recommendations.  He was well within his area of expertise. There was nothing at all to suggest bad faith. The father's application that I disregard Dr. Wannan's evidence is dismissed.  I also refuse (even if it were in my power) to make a referral to the General Medical Council.

 

9  The Law.

The parties' applications are made under the Children Act 1989 which provides that the children's welfare is my paramount consideration.  In considering the various applications before me I have regard to the matters set out in s.1(3) of the Children Act: 

 

	(a) 	the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the children concerned (considered in the light of their age and understanding); 

	(b) 	their physical, emotional and educational needs; 

	(c) 	the likely effect on them of any change in their circumstances; 

	(d) 	their age, sex, background and any characteristics which the court considers relevant; 

	(e)  	any harm which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering; 

	(f) 	how capable each of his parents is of meeting his needs.


The father applies for a shared residence order which the mother opposes.  It is not necessary to show that exceptional circumstances exist before a shared residence order may be granted.  What is required is a demonstration that the order is in the interests of the child in accordance with the requirements of s.1(1) of the Act. (See C v D (Shared Residence Order) [2001] 1 FLR 495.)  The fact that parents cannot co-operate is not a bar to a shared residence order where in all other respects this would be the right order.  (See Re R (Residence: Shared Care: Child's Views) [2006] 1FLR 491, and Re W (Shared 

 
Residence Order) [2009] 2 FLR 436, [2009] EWCA (Civ) 370. )

The mother accepts that there are authorities which suggest that a shared residence order may be appropriate where the parents are incapable of working in harmony (See Re G (Children) [2006] UKHL 43, [2006] 2FLR 629 and A v A (Shared Residence) [2004] EWHC 142, [2004] 1 FLR 1195.)  Miss Taylor referred me to the decision in the case of Re M (Residence Order) [2008] 1 FLR 1087.  

 

In relation to contact, the father referred me to the decision in the case of Re A [2006] EWCA (Civ) 1609.  This was an application for permission to appeal by the mother of two children arising out of an order for visiting contact with their father.  The court had decided at an early stage that the interests of the children, did not require a fact finding hearing. There had been contact and the mother could identify no harm that the children had in fact suffered or were at risk of suffering. [Para. 10]  

 

Wall LJ (as he then was) referred to the guidelines laid down in the case of Re L which include:  

 

"1.1 In every case in which domestic violence is put forward as a reason for refusing or limiting contact the court should at the earliest opportunity consider the allegations made and any answer to them and decide whether the nature and effect of the violence alleged by the complainant or admitted by the respondent is such as to make it likely that the order of the court for contact will be affected if such allegations are proved."

In this case District Judge Johns decided in October 2012 that a fact finding hearing was necessary.  Wall LJ noted at para. 31:

 

 	"� The father must recognise that his conduct in the past has had a profound effect on the children's mother and that if he wishes to enjoy a fruitful relationship with his two children by her, he must behave immaculately and appropriately and demonstrate that he is not a risk to either her or the children."

He added at para. 32:

	"Frequently, as happens in this case, communication between the parents is difficult if not impossible, but the father can show, I think, by giving the children happy periods of contact, that he is not a risk to the children and that the children are safe with him."

In this case Mrs. Lemonides, Dr. Wannan and the mother do not ignore the fact that the children have had unsupervised contact with the father.  They consider that it has not always been safe, that it carries risks for the children and the mother as a result of which they have considerable reservations about the benefit of frequent contact.  
  
The mother seeks an order pursuant to s.91(14) of the Act which the father opposes:   The guidelines were set out in Re P (A Minor) (Residence Order: Child's Welfare) [2000] Fam 15, [1999] 3 WLR 1164 and were summarised by Butler-Sloss LJ at 37�38, 1184 and 592�593 respectively: 

 

"Section 91(14) should be read in conjunction with s 1(1) which makes the welfare of the child the paramount consideration.

The power to restrict applications to the court is discretionary and in the exercise of its discretion the court must weigh in the balance all the relevant circumstances.

 	(iii)	An important consideration is that to impose a restriction is a statutory intrusion into the right of a party to bring proceedings before the court and to be heard in matters affecting his/her child.

	(iv) 	The power is therefore to be used with great care and sparingly, the exception and not the rule.

	(v) 	It is generally to be seen as a useful weapon of last resort in cases of repeated and unreasonable applications.

	(vi)	In suitable circumstances (and on clear evidence), a court may impose the leave restriction in cases where the welfare of the child requires it, although there is no past history of making unreasonable applications.

	(vii)	In cases under para (6) above, the court will need to be satisfied first that the facts go beyond the commonly encountered need for a time to settle to a regime ordered by the court and the all too common situation where there is animosity between the adults in dispute or between the local authority and the family and secondly that there is a serious risk that, without the imposition of the restriction, the child or the primary carers will be subject to unacceptable strain.

	(viii)	A court may impose the restriction on making applications in the 	absence of a request from any of the parties, subject, of course, to the 	rules of natural justice such as an opportunity for the parties to be heard on the point.

	(ix)	A restriction may be imposed with or without limitation of time.

	(x) 	The degree of restriction should be proportionate to the harm it is intended to avoid. Therefore the court imposing the restriction should carefully consider the extent of the restriction to be imposed and specify, where appropriate, the type of application to be restrained and the duration of the order.

	(xi)	It would be undesirable in other than the most exceptional cases to make the order ex parte."


10  Further Impressions of the Parents.

Father.

The findings which are set out in my first and second judgments remain.  Many of them taken individually are most serious and all of them, whether taken individually or together, are far more serious than any allegation the father has made about the mother at this hearing, all of which I have refused to make.  My findings form the basis for my consideration of the outstanding applications.  

 

I have considered whether the father has changed.  The mother says that he has not but Dr. Wannan told me that there was limited evidence that, with greater restriction and clarity in the court orders, the father has shown better compliance, although that level of change is not necessarily significant.  A significant level of change, which would make it more likely that he would comply with court orders, co-operate with the mother and put the children's interests first consistently, is unlikely because, having had the opportunity to read my first judgment and to discuss matters with a variety of professionals, he has not so far been able to make change over simple matters such as sending texts to the mother when he is returning the children late, and replying to her texts.  Despite his encouraging the father to review his situation and 

 
consider ways in which he could change it, Dr. Wannan observed that, sadly,  the father has not done so and therefore the chance of change within these proceedings is rather low.  

The father says that he has changed a great deal. He has been assisted by the passage of time, sessions of counselling (two, I believe), his attendance at two sessions with the DVIP and by reducing his stress by separating from the mother and reducing his working hours.  He has reflected a great deal and acknowledged that there are things that he should not have done.  He has put in place measures to ensure that he does not behave in that way again, including reducing his working hours and separating from the mother.  He considers that violent behaviour is wrong, but notes that the most recent finding of violence is some four years old.  With regard to the children, he recognises that in some situations he may react too quickly and he has seen how that can lead to his making a bad judgment call.  He is now more careful.  Throughout the period from 2010 to 2012 when he and the mother attempted a reconciliation unsuccessfully, they continued to argue but there was no physical violence because he had changed to ensure that there would be none.  

 

Dr. Wannan and Mrs. Lemonides share the view that the father will not change substantially until he does work, such as that which is offered by the DVIP in their perpetrators' programme, and acknowledges his past behaviour and the impact on the mother and the children.  They have also suggested a parenting course to assist him with the children.

 

The father has no intention of attending a DVIP programme or a parenting course. He says that no-one has explained him what a DVIP programme would achieve. In any event he has attended for two hours and in that time learned what might take others 12 weekly sessions. Similarly he had two sessions of counselling and learned all he needs to know.  

 

I share the concern of Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan that the father has not fully acknowledged the violence of the past and nor has he apologised, either to the mother or the children.  He does not acknowledge that even now he fails to put the children's interests first consistently.  To the extent that he accepts any responsibility for past behaviour, he seeks to share that responsibility with the mother.  As regards his conduct in the course of these proceedings, he blames Mrs. Lemonides, Dr. Wannan, the family justice system, the court, for the way in which he has been obliged to conduct his case. 

 

The father asserts that as long as the mother criticises him he must make counter allegations against her supported by the best evidence, such as recordings made of the children during contact.   I considered the father's negotiating style in my first judgment (para.62) when I noted that: 

 

"The father explained to me (with reference to his texts to the mother on Christmas Day 2012) that he put his case as strongly as he could or, indeed, more strongly, but he did not expect her to meet his case.   He was right to call her an abuser with the intention of negotiating to a position somewhere in the middle.  He is a commercial lawyer and that is how he negotiates."  

	At this hearing he told me: "The way I see it, people come to court ready for a fight and then settle."   The father has not changed his approach to this family litigation, although I have suggested that it is not constructive, and I expect that when he has chosen to be represented, he has been similarly advised.  

The father has continued his barrage of criticisms of the mother as an abuser, liar, bully, a controlling woman who seeks to undermine his contact with the children.  As I observed in my first judgment, he does not have anything positive to say about her. This attitude, combined with his dislike of her reported by Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan and his obvious anger in the course of the hearing, lends considerable weight to the mother's concern that he continues to denigrate her to the children.

 

The father has made a number of statements in the course of this hearing which have caused me concern.  He asserted that my findings of fact establish that the mother had lied and exaggerated.  I found that the mother did not exaggerate [Para.44]   and that her evidence was measured, honest and reliable. [Para.59]  

 

The father cross-examined Dr. Wannan on the basis of the allegations in respect of which he sought findings, without disclosing that he had made recordings which were relevant to two of the allegations.  He told Dr. Wannan that the mother had said to A: "How dare you ask him".  The father had the recording of this exchange and had transcribed it.  No one else knew of its existence.  The father knew that the account on which he invited Dr. Wannan to comment was not true.  

 

The father insisted that on 18th February 2013 Mrs. Taylor made an unsuccessful application to District Judge Marin for an order prohibiting him from recording the children during contact.  At the end of this hearing the father questioned the basis on which I could make an order preventing him from recording the children at contact during the interim period prior to handing down this judgment.  The father was at court on 18th February 2013 and he was represented by counsel.  He is a solicitor. He pays careful attention to detail and, in my view, he knew that no such application had been made. 

 

In his complaints against Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan I found that the father's allegations contain some inaccurate and incomplete accounts of their evidence and in some instances what they said or wrote was taken out of context.  I have rejected them all.

 

The father is the applicant in these proceedings.  He seeks a shared residence order, which is not agreed and, in the course of his evidence, suggests that once a shared residence order is made, he and the mother will be able to build a communication bridge.  He has not been civil to her in the course of the hearing.  He has put his allegations to her in an aggressive manner.  He has not been able to be civil outside the hearings, for example by texting to tell her that he was bringing the children home late.  He has not dealt with the children's invitations to parties and their piano concert in a civil, polite manner. In the course of his evidence for the first time the father suggested a more conciliatory approach, provided a shared residence order is made.  It came as no surprise that the mother did not trust this sudden change of heart. This late, and rather grudging change of approach goes to the father's credibility.

 

For all these reasons I find that I can have no confidence in the father's evidence.

 

The Mother.

My impressions of the mother have not changed from my first and second judgments.  She has promoted contact throughout this case with the exception of the 2nd August 2013 when she was shocked to receive Mrs. Lemonides' recommendation that contact should be suspended and made an application in those terms.  Since then she has suggested further contact for Eid, and has agreed to change contact arrangements so that the father could spend C's birthday with the children.  I repeat what I said in my second judgment: the mother has supported contact when many others would not have done so.  

 

She has continued to be fair to the father.  She acknowledges that there has been some improvement and that the children enjoy contact, while recognising that sometimes it is difficult and they have issues about it.  I find that the mother has tried to do her best for the children throughout these proceedings. 

 
I accept that it is for that reason that she has not always sought to enforce breaches of my orders, and note that after discussion with Dr. Wannan she takes a different view.  

Initially the mother did not support my suggestion that I obtain a report from Dr. Wannan: she felt that the children had seen a lot of professionals and this could be harmful to them.  However, it is clear from his report, and her response to it, that the mother found Dr. Wannan's advice of great benefit.  She acknowledged that the children had enjoyed meeting him and felt able to accept his recommendations.  In my view the mother has come to her final position reluctantly and after giving the matter a great deal of careful thought. 

 

I accept that these proceedings, which began in April 2012 with the father's application for a residence order and prohibited steps order, have caused the mother a great deal of anxiety.  It has been obvious from her demeanour in the witness box, especially when questioned by the father, that she has found the hearings arduous and the subject matter distressing. 

 

In my first judgment, I found the mother to be an honest and reliable witness. Where there were factual differences between the parents' evidence I preferred her evidence.  I have reviewed my findings of fact and my further findings very carefully. I have no reason to alter my views.  

 
 
In addition, having considered all the evidence I find that the father has continued to make derogatory remarks about the mother to and/or in front of the children.

 

11  Discussion and Decisions. 

In considering the outstanding applications I have kept in mind the welfare of the children and the matters set out in the welfare checklist.  This has been a difficult case, marked by parental acrimony which is due largely to the past, recent and current behaviour of the father. I do not doubt that, as in most cases, there will have been faults on both sides, but here there are serious findings and other concerns about the father which he does not acknowledge. He seeks instead to criticise the mother and blames the family court system and everyone else involved in proceedings in which he is the applicant. The system is far from perfect, as current reforms acknowledge, but the father is an intelligent, educated man who has chosen an approach which has exacerbated an already difficult situation. 

 

I accept that the children love their father, as they love their mother, and that they want to see him. They have reported to Mrs.  Lemonides and Dr. Wannan that family life has been better since he left the family home and that contact has recently improved.  Nevertheless there are problems: late returns after contact; the father's refusal to communicate with the mother and the consequential involvement of the children, especially A, as messengers; his interpretation of his undertakings which have had the effect of preventing the children from taking part in social activities; his insistence on his right to adopt a different parenting style when the children are with him, despite the children's protests; his derogatory comments about the mother which distresses the children and her distress which adds to theirs.

 

Mrs. Lemonides told me that the father "hasn't got the basics right" but he could, if he chose to.

 

I accept that a final order is in the interests of the children in the hope that it will bring this litigation to an end.

 
 
Residence and Contact.

At the hearing on 25th October 2012, the parties agreed that the children would live with the mother and the order made then has remained in effect until now.  The father does not take issue with the mother being the primary carer but he says that a shared residence order will give the children stability and certainty and tell them that they have two parents who love them.  He proposes that the children spend 60% of term time with the mother but that holidays are shared equally. 

 

The mother seeks a final order granting sole residence of the children to her. She believes that the father would use a shared residence order to continue to try to bully and control her.  She says that this is not a case about a lack of harmony or even just acrimony but a campaign by the father to undermine her ability to care for the children.  She has accepted Dr. Wannan's recommendation that the children's contact with the father should be reduced.

 

I accept the recommendations of Dr. Wannan and Mrs. Lemonides as to the children's residence.   Having considered all the evidence I find that in the circumstances of this case a shared residence order would not be in the interests of the children as the father would use it to try to undermine the mother's care of them. The children will remain living with the mother under a sole residence order.

 

The father proposes that the children should spend 40% of their time during the school term and half the holidays with him. He has referred me to Re: A which I have considered and which I distinguish from this case because here there are findings of domestic violence and emotional abuse, the father has not recognised the effect of his behaviour on the mother and the children and he has not behaved in such a way as to demonstrate that he is not a risk to the children. The mother accepts the recommendations of Dr. Wannan as to contact. I prefer his views about contact to those of Mrs. Lemonides because he has seen the children recently, has analysed the effects of contact on them and has considered the balanced between their wishes and their needs. I will order that the children be made available for contact for visiting contact with their father, from 10 am to 5pm once a fortnight.  The first such contact will take place on Saturday 1st February 2014. The children will spend both Eids with the father from 9am until 9pm on terms which will be set out in my order.  In these circumstances I find that the children should spend Christmas with their mother with the result that if Christmas falls on a Saturday, the contact will take place on the following Saturday, 1st January.

The father proposes that all restrictions should be removed from indirect contact so that the parties and the children can find their own balance.  However, if indirect contact is to be defined, there should be a guideline of 45 minutes with flexible timing between 7 pm and 8 pm.  The restriction on the father discussing contact with the children should be clarified.  The mother proposes that the father have indirect telephone/face time contact with the children on their birthdays and his birthday for a period of 45 minutes from 7.15 pm to 8 pm.  In the event that direct contact falls on the children's or the father's birthday there will be no indirect contact, nor will indirect contact take place if the children are on holiday away from their home.  I have noted the difficulties that have arisen during and in relation to indirect contact and agree that it should be limited as Dr Wannan recommends and the mother proposes. Both direct and indirect contact will be subject to conditions similar to those set out in my order of 14th June 2013. The detail will be contained in the order I make following this judgment.

 

The father's undertakings as to contact and other matters remain in force. The undertaking not to discuss contact with the children does not prevent him from talking to them about their activities during contact.  In view of the evidence 

 
I have heard about the father's practice of recording the children during contact, I order that he shall not do so.  For the avoidance of doubt this order does not prevent the father from recording the things that parents typically like to keep, such as a child performing in a school play or concert or a birthday party when the child would know that a recording is being or has been made.  It is intended to prevent the making of recordings to be used as evidence.



Applications for Prohibited Steps and Specific Issues Orders 

The father seeks specific issues and prohibited steps orders in relation to the children's medical care and education.  In particular, he wants to attend C's appointments at CAMHS and he wants B's progress in English and maths to be assessed with a view to her receiving tuition. The mother seeks an order giving her permission to determine issues relating to B's tuition, the children's education, their health, including doctor and dentist appointments and treatment and their attending CAHMS without providing the father's consent, but on the basis that she provides him with relevant information within a reasonable time.

 

 I find that the mother's application if granted would be an unreasonable restriction of the father's parental responsibility but also that the father's application if granted would enable him to try impose his preferences on the mother.  A balance must be found. The mother shall be able to make routine medical and dental appointments for the children which the father does not need to attend.  She may request that a child be referred to CAMHS. Whether the father should attend C's appointments with CAMHS is a matter for the therapist, who will also decide whether s/he needs to see the father. If there is medical or other emergency, the mother will have to respond to it immediately and inform the father promptly. If the children require serious treatment, the father should be informed and consulted.  I would expect both parents to act in accordance with medical advice and the children's welfare.

 

I have seen no evidence that B requires an educational assessment: her teachers and head master can advise and the mother will act on their advice and in her best interests. The father should be consulted about the children's schools in advance of a decision being made.

 

Both the father's and the mother's applications are refused.  I will include the indications set out in paragraphs 240 � 214 in my order.

 


Mother's application for an Order pursuant to s. 91(14) Children Act 1989. 

The mother seeks an order for a duration of five years. The father opposes the application but provided the children's time is split broadly as to 60 per cent with the mother and 40 per cent with the father, he would agree to an order which would apply to both parties, would run to 31st July 2015, but would not apply to issues relating to B's education or medical treatment. 

 

Dr Wannan told me that if a final order is made, it will be a weighty responsibility for the mother to police the contact arrangements but she has acted responsibly by promoting contact and has prioritised the children's need above her own. An order pursuant to s 91(14) of the Act would be sensible.  

 

I have considered the guidance set out in Re: P and acknowledge that an order requiring the father to obtain leave to make an application is draconian, although it is not an absolute bar to further applications. The father told Dr. Wannan that he will not give up while the mother criticises him. In other words, unless she accepts his behaviour without criticism or complaint, these proceedings will continue. The history I have set out in this judgment together with that declared intention, in my view, takes this case beyond the common situation. I make an order pursuant to s 91(14) but for a duration of 3 years during which time I hope the parents will be able to develop a co-operative approach to parenting.

 

The European Convention on Human Rights.

I have had regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protects the rights of the father and the children to a family life. They will continue to have direct contact and on that basis I consider that my decision does not violate their rights.

 

The Costs of Dr. Wannan's Addendum Report.

The parties agreed to share the costs of Dr. Wannan's addendum report, which was prepared in relation to the father's continued recording of the children at contact.  The father could have disclosed the existence of the recordings and applied for them to be admitted as evidence prior to Dr. Wannan giving his evidence, and Dr. Wannan would then have been able to consider the significance of those recordings in the course of his evidence; there would have been no need for an addendum report.

 

I have refused the father's application to disregard Dr. Wannan's reports and evidence.  I order that the father will pay the whole of the costs of the addendum report in the sum of �1,700, those costs to be paid within 21 days of the date of my order.

 

The Mother's Application for the Costs of the Fact Finding Hearing.

The mother applies for an order that the father pay �24,844.00 (80 per cent) of her costs of the fact finding hearing. The father says the application is an abuse of process.

 
I first considered this application at the hearing on 14th June 2013 but adjourned it when the father said that the mother had been awarded her legal costs of the entire proceedings at the hearing before Deputy District Judge Hopkins on 19th April 2013. The transcript of her judgment was not available at the time. The mother's application was further adjourned pending the father's application for permission to appeal my first judgment.  

 

The decision that there should be a fact finding hearing was made by District Judge Johns on 25th October 2012 on the advice of Mrs. Lemonides. 

 

The Law. 

I note that the Family Procedure Rules 2010, at Rule 28, provide that a court can make such order as to costs as it thinks just and that although family proceedings are exempt from the normal rule in civil proceedings that costs should follow the event, it can provide a helpful starting point.

 

I acknowledge that costs orders in Children Act cases are unusual. In his judgment in the case of Re: J (Costs of Fact-Finding Hearing) [2009] EWCA Civ 1350, to which both parties have referred me, Wilson LJ discussed the decision in the case of Re: T (Order for Costs) [2005] EWCA Civ 311. He observed that the fact finding hearing in that case: 

 

	"had contained a feature which was relevant to costs and which differentiated it from a conventional hearing under the Act in which both parties submit rival proposals for the optimum arrangements for the child". 

In Re: J a separate fact finding hearing was necessary and:

	"the optimum outcome of the contact application could be determined only by reference to the findings made ...the effect was ... that the costs incurred by the mother in relation to that hearing can confidently be seen to be wholly referable to her allegations against the father". [para. 17]  

	The hearing was devoted exclusively to the court's consideration of serious and relevant allegations against the father; over two-thirds of the allegations were true and those that were not established were not found to be untrue. The father was ordered to pay two-thirds of her costs of the fact finding hearing.

	

 	The findings.

I considered 52 allegations. In respect of the mother's 32 allegations I made 22 findings. The father denied the allegations or made only partial admissions and I had to hear full evidence. I did not find that any of the mother's allegations was false. In respect of the father's 20 allegations I made none, bearing in mind that the mother accepted the part of finding 51 which related to her and that 

 
I also found (in summary) that the father's response to this incident was inappropriate. 

The findings I made in respect of the mother's allegations include three findings of serious violence by the father towards her in 2009: holding a lighter to her thigh, in front of the children (Finding 3), threatening her with a knife to her neck and forcing her down the stairs at knife point in front of C 

 
- then age 3 - (Finding 5) and pushing her throat and squeezing it (Findings 16 and 17).  Although it does not form part of the finding, the last of these incidents took place at the door to a bedroom in which the children were sleeping (First judgment, para. 144).

The findings which related to the children included behaviour by the father which I considered insensitive, ill-judged, not child-centred and emotionally abusive. 

 

Deputy District Judge Hopkins' Judgment. 	

I have read the transcript of Deputy District Judge Hopkins' judgment dated 19th April 2013. In the context of her decision that there should be a clean break and in view of the finance available, she considered that each parent would require �525,000 to purchase a new home and a capital sum. The mother had proposed a sum of �37,000 which allowed for legal fees and the purchase of a car. I note that the father had purchased a new car for �8,700 and he accepted that the mother needed a car. 

 

On the basis of the available assets DDJ Hopkins calculated that the mother should receive �557,840.72, i.e. 68 per cent of the total. This would enable her to purchase a house and "leave her with some capital to pay the identified expenses that she has". (Costs bundle at B29) DDJ Hopkins did not say that the mother's capital fund was intended to cover the whole of her legal costs. She could not know what those costs would be.  I note that if the mother were to pay �525,000 for a new home and purchase a car of similar value to the father's car, she would have less than �25,000 towards her legal fees which 

 
I understand are in the region of �65,000.   

I find that the mother's application that the father pay part of the costs of the fact finding hearing is not an abuse of process. The fact finding hearing was necessary: my findings provided a basis for the work of Mrs. Lemonides and Dr. Wannan and I could not have determined the issues at this final hearing without having made them.  I find that it is fair and reasonable that the father should pay 65 per cent of the mother's costs of the fact finding hearing.  

 
I cannot translate that percentage into a figure as I did not carry out a summary assessment of the costs but I am prepared to do so, on the basis of written submissions, to avoid the delay and expense of a further hearing.

Her Honour Judge Brown.

The hearing.

The proceedings before me are in respect of a 10 year old boy who I shall refer to as K.  There have been contested Children Act 1989 proceedings.  On 23rd. August 2013 after a contested hearing, the Buckinghamshire Family Proceedings Court made a Residence Order in respect of K in favour of Mother, a contact order for alternate weekend contact and further orders for holiday and telephone contact between K with Father and a costs order against father in favour of mother in the sum of �5155.80.

The matter has come before me today on the appeal by the Appellant father against the order for costs.  The substantive Children Act 1989 orders are not challenged.  Throughout this judgment I shall refer to Appellant Father as father and the Respondent Mother as mother.

Both parties were unrepresented before me.  Mother had been represented throughout by her solicitor Ms. Jennings.  However, I am told that Mother can no longer afford legal representation and so she appeared in person at the appeal.  I have not heard from Ms. Jennings directly in this matter but the views I have expressed about the submissions made by Ms. Jennings are based on her written submissions.

I say at once that I am aware how stressful and distressing these proceedings and this hearing have been for both parents and I commend both parties for the way in which they have conducted themselves before me.  Being an advocate on one's own behalf is never an easy task and I take full account of the stress both parties are under.

I have considered all of the papers before me.  I have no formal trial bundle but I am satisfied that I have had regard to the relevant statements and documentation. 

My role.

I have kept at the forefront of my mind my limited role as an appellate court.  I remind myself of CPR r52.11.

"(1) Every appeal will be limited to a review of the decision of the lower court unless 

(a)	a practice direction makes different provision for a particular category of appeal;

or

(b)	 the court considers that in the circumstances of an individual appeal it would be in the interests of justice to hold a re-hearing.



(2)	Unless it orders otherwise, the appeal court will not receive � 



(a)	oral evidence; or

(b)	evidence which was not before the lower court.



(3)	The appeal court will allow an appeal where the decision of the lower court was;

(a)	Wrong; or

(b)	Unjust because of a serious procedural or other irregularity in the proceedings in the lower court.

I have limited my role to that of review of the lower court.  Clearly both parties did their best to make submissions but at times both parties strayed into giving evidence.  I do not criticise either of them for that but I have endeavoured to separate submissions made from evidence given.

Key documents before me are the facts and reasons handed down by the Magistrates.    There are in fact three sets of reasons handed down by the Buckinghamshire Family Proceedings Court.  The first set is the reasons for the making of the substantive Children Act 1989 orders.  The second set is the reasons given for the making of the costs order.  Both these are dated 23rd. August 2013.  Once father had appealed the order for costs the matter came before His Honour Judge Hughes.  In a pre-amble to an order dated 20th. November 2013, His Honour Judge Hughes noted,

"Upon the court indicating the Justices Facts and reasons in relation to the costs issue were not sufficiently cogent and clear in relation to any findings they made regarding the litigation conduct of the Appellant and it was necessary for them to set out with some particularity the reasonableness or otherwise of the appellants litigation conduct."

His Honour Judge Hughes ordered that the Justices perfect their facts and reasons and the matter was to be listed before His Honour Judge Hughes.

On 19th. December 2013, the Justices handed down further facts and reasons to explain their decision in respect of the order for costs.  In fact, one of the Justices had retired and therefore the remaining two Justices completed this task.

The matter then came back before His Honour Judge Hughes on 31st/ January 2014.  The court ordered that 

"1.	The matter be adjourned to the first open date after 21 days, time estimate 2 hours

2. The respondent do file a detailed Bill of Costs for Assessment to justify the figure they have claimed in 14 days


 

3. The respondent has permission to respond to the Appellant document.


 

A bill of costs for assessment was duly filed and served.

The appeal was then listed before me on 12th. March 2014.

I should also note that at the commencement of the appeal, mother submitted that His Honour Judge Hughes had determined that the appeal would be allowed and that the only issue to be determined was in respect of the quantum of costs Father would be ordered to pay.  It was clear to me having reviewed the file that there was no order which reflected such a ruling.  I gave mother the opportunity to telephone Ms. Jennings to clarify why she believed the hearing before me had been limited in this way.  To my knowledge, the Respondent did not avail herself of this opportunity.  I therefore heard the appeal on the basis that His Honour Judge Hughes had made no such ruling.

The History.

Before turning to the details of this particular appeal I am going to set out briefly the background to this case.  When child K was born in 2006 both parties were living in Milton Keynes.  The parties separated in 2008,  K remained living with mother and having contact with father.  Both parties accept that there is an extremely difficult relationship between them and both accept that there have been difficulties over arranging contact between K with Father.  It is accepted that despite difficulties, K has always had contact with Father.  

There were contested proceedings in 2011 when Mother together with her husband, her other child and her husband's child, sought permission to move to relocate permanently to Northern Cyprus.  Father objected to K moving to Northern Cyprus and there was a three day contested hearing in the Milton Keynes County Court.  I have not seen a judgment from that hearing but it is accepted by both parties that mother's application for permission to remove K permanently to Northern Cyprus was refused.  I understand both parties paid privately for representation and Father told me at the time that his legal costs amounted to nearly �10,000.  

There also seems to be common ground that although there were continued difficulties in communication between the parties between 2011 and 2013 there was ongoing contact between K and father with father seeing K at least one evening per week and every other weekend from Saturday morning until Sunday evening.  It seems that matters were running relatively smoothly until May 2013.  

It is clear from the papers and confirmed to me by father that in May 2013 he became suspicious and subsequently learnt that mother was moving the family from their home in Milton Keynes.  He told me during this appeal hearing that he was concerned that given the history, mother was in fact going to relocate K to Northern Cyprus despite the court hearing in 2011.  In fact Mother planned to relocate the entire family to Kent and it is accepted by her that she gave father no notice of this move which would entail a change of school, home and contact regime for K with Father.  

There is a dispute about the precise time when father knew that mother was in fact moving with the family to Kent rather than Northern Cyprus.  I have looked through the original court statements and it is clear that by 9th May father knew mother was moving to Kent because he has included that in his statement dated 9th May 2013.  In any event father attended at Milton Keynes County Court on 9th May 2013 and secured an order prohibiting mother from removing the child from the jurisdiction.  

Mother and her family including K, relocated from Milton Keynes to Kent on 9th May 2013.  Mother had secured a place at a school in Kent for the two other children but she told me that she could not secure a place at any school for K until K was actually living in the county.  Therefore the agreed facts of the case are that on 9th May 2013, mother, without any consultation with father moved K from his home, took him out of school, relocated to Kent and by so doing knew that the contact arrangements which included midweek contact would have to change because it would simply be impractical given the geographical distance between the two families.  

The matter returned to court on 16th May 2013 and mother, who was intending to take K and the family to Northern Cyprus for two weeks in the summer 2013, gave undertakings that she would return K back to the jurisdiction after the holidays.  Due to mother's relocation to Kent there were then cross-applications for residence, both parents applying for residence of K.  Father was upset and concerned that K had been removed from Milton Keynes and removed from the school that he was in.  One of his concerns was that K had missed a great deal of school, up to 30 days, and he was very concerned that without his close supervision at school K would continue to miss a lot of school.  

Mother could give no cogent reason for her failure to notify Father of this move save that it is clear Mother wants no communication with Father and told me that he had made her life a "living hell" for six years.  Wherever the fault lies in the poor communication between these parents, the fact remains that these parents share parental responsibility for this child and this Mother acted unilaterally thereby deliberately sidelining any input this father had into the future care arrangements for K.

In terms of the substantive Children Act 1989 applications Mother argued that it was obvious that K should remain with her, he had always lived with her and there were no real concerns about her ability to care for K.  Mother accepted that K had missed school but told me that this is because he is particularly good at a particular sort of dance for which  he has represented England at a national level and that any absences have been authorised and due to this sport for which he is particularly talented.  

Unsurprisingly within these proceedings, the court ordered a Section 7 Cafcass report and  Mr Brian Shields Cafcass officer reported dated 8th August 2013.  He set out his conclusions in an eight page report and his recommendations are as follows.

1.	That K is to continue to live with his mother.

2.	That father is to have contact with K as currently directed which was alternate weekend contact.

3.	There were further recommendations including that mother provide father with a schedule of dance competitions for the remainder of 2013 and at agreed regular intervals and that mother is to give an assurance to the court that K will not miss school or contact as a result of competitions.

4.	There should be consideration given to father taking K to competitions as part of his contact and that there should be any other contact as agreed between the parties. 

Father was not prepared to accept the recommendations of the CAFCASS officer because he did not accept that Mr Shields had looked sufficiently carefully at why K had missed so much school and therefore father pursued his application for Residence.

Both parties informed me that at the beginning of the contested hearing which was listed for two days over 22nd and 23rd August 2013, both parents sought a Residence Order in respect of K but there was agreement that the noncustodial parent would have fortnightly weekend contact from Friday to Sunday, the only dispute was a small matter in relation to the drop-off point on the Sunday evening.  I am told that the Justices heard from mother and her husband, from father and his partner, from a further witness on behalf of father who coached K during a sporting activity at the weekend and also from the Cafcass officer Mr Shields.  There is no dispute between the parties that all the evidence and the submissions were heard on the first day.  

It is noted in the Justices's reasons that at the end of the first day, father was asked whether he wished to continue with the case.  He said that he did and therefore the matter went over to the second day for the facts and reasons to be given. The magistrates then handed down their decision and reasons on 23rd August, they made a residence order in favour of mother, they ordered contact for K with father on alternate weekends.  Once these decisions had been handed down, Ms. Jennings on behalf of Mother made an application for costs against father.  It was submitted that the amount of the costs came to �5,155.80. 

The Law and the correct test to be applied when considering an application for costs in Children Act 1989 proceedings.  

The first question I ask myself is how were the magistrates directed, what test should they have applied and which factors should they have considered, when exercising their discretion to make a costs order against Father.

I have seen the written submissions/ skeleton argument put forward by Ms. Jennings and I will return to this, in due course.

Under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 at Rule 44.2 subparagraph (2) the Rule is as follows.  If the court decides to make an order about costs:

(a)	the general Rule is that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party; but

(b) 	the court may make a different order

Under the Family Procedure Rules 2010 Rule 28.2 subparagraph (1) expressly disapplies that Rule within family proceedings and therefore there is no presumption that the unsuccessful party will be ordered to pay the costs of the successful party.  

Under FPR 28.1 the rule is that,

"The court may at any time make such order as to costs as it thinks fit."

Looking at the Red Book the following guidance is given.  "Orders for costs in children proceedings generally will be rare.  but the starting point is likely to be R v R (Costs: Child Case) [1997] 2 FLR 95." 

Ms. Jennings did not refer the case of  R v R to the Justices.  The headnote reads as follows, 

"Although there was a general practice not to order costs in cases concerning children courts retained a discretion to do so and in exceptional circumstances might be justified in ordering costs.  It was unnecessary and undesirable to attempt to limit or place into rigid categories the cases in which courts might order costs but amongst those cases would be those where a party had been guilty of unreasonable contact.  The unreasonable conduct which might justify an order for costs was not unreasonableness in relation to the child concerned but unreasonableness in the conduct of the litigation although parents should not be deterred from putting cases concerning children before the courts it would not be wrong to discourage unreasonable parents from putting forward unreasonable views." 

On the facts of this case the judge was justified in finding that the father had acted unreasonably in relation to his conduct of the litigation.  As I have said it is a great pity that this case was not put before the magistrates and it is I who have had regard to it in considering this appeal.  Neither parent as they are litigants in person have been able to put forward case law and of course I do not criticise them for that.  

It is important when considering any application for costs to be aware that FPR 28.2 does NOT disapply CPR 44.2 (4),(5) and (6).  In my judgment it is necessary to set these out in full.

CPR 44.2

(4)	In deciding what order (if any) to make about costs, the court must have regard to all the circumstances, including:

(a)	the conduct of all the parties;

(b)	whether a party had succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful; and

(c)	any payment to the court or admissible offer to settle made by a party which is drawn to the court's attention and which is not an offer to which costs consequences under part 36 apply.  

 (5)	The conduct of the parties includes:

(a)	conduct before, as well as during, the proceedings and in particular the extent to which the parties followed the Practice Direction (Pre-Action Conduct) or any relevant pre-action protocol;

(b)	whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue;

(c)	the manner in which a party has pursued or defended his case or a particular allegation or issue; and

(d)	whether a claimant who has succeeded in his claim, in whole or in part, exaggerated his claim.

(6)     The orders which the court may make under this rule include an order that a party must pay � 

(a)	a proportion of another party's costs

(b)	a stated amount in respect of another party's costs;

(c)	costs from or until a certain date only;

(d)	costs incurred before the proceedings have begun;

(e)	costs relating to particular steps taken in the proceedings

(f)	costs relating only to a distinct part of the proceedings; and

(g)	interest on costs from or until a certain date, including a date before judgment

The requirement to consider these rules was expressly considered in the case Re T [2012] UKSC 36, again a judgment referred to in the Red Book and a judgment of the Supreme Court which considers costs.  At paragraph 10 the provisions relating to costs are set out as follows,

"Family Procedure Rules 28.1 provides that: "The court may at any time make such order as to costs as it thinks just".  This is not an unfettered discretion for FPR 28.2 makes applicable to family proceedings other than financial remedy proceedings, the majority of the Rules in relation to costs of the CPR.  The most significant of the Rules excluded is the general Rule that costs follow the event quoted above in CPR 44.3(2). "  (set out above.)

The court went on then at paragraph 11 to say the following,

"4(b) is relevant in relation to a regime where the general Rule in 2(a) applies.  For this reason we do not see that it has any direct relevance to family proceedings.  4(c) can have no relevance to public law proceedings and can thus be disregarded in the present case.  The other Rules are simply examples of circumstances that will be relevant when considering the result that justice requires in the individual case.  In family proceedings however there are usually special considerations that militate against the approach that is appropriate in other kinds of adversarial civil litigation.  This is particularly true where the interests of a child are at stake.  This explains why it is common in family proceedings and usual in proceedings involving a child for no order to be made in relation to costs.  The reasons for departing from the principle that costs normally follow the event differ however depending upon the nature of the family proceedings. On appeal it is necessary to identify the policy considerations that should inform the approach to costs that is required in the interest of justice in care proceedings."

Whilst the case of Re T was dealing with a public law matter there was acceptance of this reasoning by Wilson LJ in the case of Sutton London Borough Council v Davis where he gave the following views.

"Where the debate surrounds the future of a child the proceedings are partly inquisitorial and the aspiration is that in their outcome the child is the winner and indeed the only winner.  The court does not wish the spectre of an order for costs to discourage those with a proper interest in the child from participating in the debate nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their cooperation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them.  The proposition applies in its fullest form to proceedings between parents and other relations but it also applies to proceeding to which the local authority are a party but even when the local authority's application for a care order is dismissed it is unusual to order them to pay the costs of the other parties.  The proposition is not applied where for example the conduct of a party has been reprehensible or the party's stance has been beyond the band of what is reasonable."

It is further regrettable that Ms. Jennings did not refer the Justices to

In the matter of N (A child) A and G and N (by his Guardian, CP).  I have inserted paragraphs 43 � 57.  Mr. Justice Munby (as he then was) writes as follows,

43.	Costs � discussion 

44.	It is I think convenient to consider first the costs of the section 8 issues. 

45.	There is, in my judgment, some force in many of the points Dr Pelling makes, in particular his contention that a much more discriminating approach to the father's various applications is required than the 'all or nothing' broad-brush approach adopted by the mother. And it is a fact that, even if only responsively to the father's many applications, the mother did make and pursue � unsuccessfully � some applications of her own. Furthermore I do take leave to wonder whether the mother is really justified in saying that she spent, or that if she spent she reasonably spent, as many as 650 hours in preparing her case. 

46.	As against that the father's approach, in my judgment, was unreasonable: unreasonable both in parts, though not, I emphasise, in every respect, and also, given the sheer number and reach of his applications � no fewer than 30 applications arising out of what was after all a consent order � unreasonable in its scale and overall effect. 

47.	That said, the fact that a parent has litigated in an unreasonable fashion may open the door to the making of an adverse costs order; but it does not of itself necessitate the making of such an order. There is, at the end of the day, a broad discretion to be exercised having regard to all the circumstances of the case. And a judge must be careful not to fall into the trap of simply assuming that because there has been unreasonable behaviour in the conduct of the litigation an order is therefore to be made without more ado. Careful attention must be paid to all the circumstances of the case and to the factors which, on the authorities I have referred to, indicate that normally it is inappropriate to make such an order � factors which do not simply disappear or cease to have weight merely because the litigation has been conducted unreasonably. 

48.	I have to say plainly that the father's litigation conduct has, in my assessment, come very close indeed to justifying the order the mother seeks. But I am persuaded, on balance, that it would not be fair, just or reasonable to make that order, not least � and this is an important factor in my thinking � because of the likely effect the making of such an order will have on relations between the parents and thus, and crucially, on N. 

49.	There is, if I may say so, much wisdom in what Wilson J said in London Borough of Sutton v Davis (Costs) (No 2) [1994] 2 FLR 569 at pages 570-571: 

"Where the debate surrounds the future of a child, the proceedings are partly inquisitorial and the aspiration is that in their outcome the child is the winner and indeed the only winner. The court does not wish the spectre of an order for costs to discourage those with a proper interest in the child from participating in the debate. Nor does it wish to reduce the chance of their co-operation around the future life of the child by casting one as the successful party entitled to his costs and another as the unsuccessful party obliged to pay them."

50.	Or, as Hale J put the point in R v R (Costs: Child Case) [1997] 2 FLR 95 at page 97, where she referred to: 

"the possibility that in effect a costs order will add insult to the injury of having lost in the debate as to what is to happen to the child in the future; it is likely therefore to exacerbate rather than to calm down the existing tensions; and this will not be in the best interests of the child."

51.	I do not take so bleak a view as the mother's when she suggests that matters are already so bad that they can get no worse. Moreover, it needs to be remembered that the mother is not blameless in all this: see, in particular, what I said in Re N (A Child), A v G [2009] EWHC 1807 (Fam) at paras [46] and [202]. There is, I fear, a very real risk that were I to make the order the mother seeks she would treat it as a complete vindication of every negative view she has about the father � an outcome that would assist neither the parents nor their son. 

52.	For all these reasons I have concluded that notwithstanding the way in which the father has chosen to conduct this litigation, the proper order to make is that there should be 'no order' in relation to the costs of the section 8 issues. I make it clear, however, that if there is any further continuation of the litigation by the father making any further unsuccessful applications, a very different order may very well have to be made. 

53.	I turn to the costs of the disclosure issue, where I accept that somewhat different considerations apply. 

54.	I make clear that, despite Ms Farror's submission to the contrary, I take no issue in the particular circumstances of this somewhat unusual case with the quantum of the costs being claimed, whether in respect of the quantum of Dr Pelling's hourly charging rate or in respect of the number of hours he worked. Dr Pelling may be unqualified but he is plainly highly knowledgeable and experienced in such matters and he is entitled to charge, if he can find clients willing to pay his fees, at an hourly rate which can hardly be said to be extravagant when contrasted with the fees one frequently finds being charged to privately paying clients in family cases. 

55.	The real question, to my mind, has nothing to do with the quantum of the costs being claimed, but rather with whether, in all the circumstances, it is appropriate to make any order at all. 

56.	In my judgment it is not. I appreciate that, from one perspective, the child is less directly implicated in the disclosure issue than in the section 8 issues, and that the dispute here is not so much between the father and the mother as between the father and the guardian, but one cannot ignore the fact that but for the happenstance of litigation (which led to the disclosure issue being 'hived off' as a separate issue at the hearing on 5 May 2009) the disclosure issue would have been dealt with as part of the overall litigation. Nor can one ignore the fact that the guardian participated in this issue in accordance with directions that I had given. 

57.	In my judgment, the appropriate order to make in all the circumstances is that there be 'no order' as to these costs. 

Therefore having reminded myself of the relevant rules and case law, it seems abundantly clear that the starting point and the presumption is that there is no order for costs in Children Act 1989 cases and that although the Family Court may make any such order as to costs as it thinks fit, departure from the no order for costs presumption, must only be undertaken having considered the factors set out under CPR 44.2 (4), (5) and (6) and having considered relevant case law.    

Submissions made to the Justices.

So what assistance did the magistrates have in considering whether a costs order was the appropriate order in this case?  Ms. Jennings on behalf of Mother filed written submissions after the magistrates had handed down their reasons on the substantive applications.  I should say that father could not remember being handed the written submissions but mother told me that Ms Jennings handed the written submissions to father.  For the purposes of this hearing I will accept that Ms Jennings passed the written submissions to father.  Neither father nor mother could remember the matter being adjourned, even for a short period, to enable father to read the written submissions.  If true, this concerns me, but I have not heard from Miss Jennings on that point.  It is important that I set out the first part of Ms Jennings' written submissions as they appear on the printed page.  

"As you will be aware the general principle in proceedings is that a losing party would pay the costs (CPR 44.2). 

It is less common in children matters and the General Rule does not apply but I would like to refer you to FAMILY PROCEEDINGS RULES 28.1 THE COURT MAY AT ANY TIME MAKE SUCH ORDER AS TO COSTS AS IT THINKS FIT. 

CPR 4.3(c) except in cases where essential Respondent must not be aware of application the applicant SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO NOTIFY THE RESPONDENT�...

You have discretion in regard of costs and that discretion should be exercised when a party has acted unreasonably and with folly."

Ms Jennings referred the Justices to the case of HH v BLW [2012] EWHC 2199 (Fam).  The headnote reads,

"Application for permission to appeal against a District Judge's order for costs against a father in contact proceedings.  Application refused on the basis of the proportionality of the appeal to the sum in issue."

The case was in relation to a father seeking contact to his daughter who at the time of the proceedings was rising 16.  The court made an order for costs against the father when the court made no order on his contact application, after the CAFCASS officer ascertained that the child did not wish to see him.

The first hearing dispute resolution appointment took place on 14th March when the child was 15.  The child was due to be 16 in June of that year, some three months later.  At that first appointment the Cafcass officer met the child who reported a firm view that she was unwilling to see her father at that stage.  In the light of that and without resistance by or on behalf of the father, the District Judge ordered that there be no order on the father's application as to contact.  At that point the mother's solicitor applied for costs.  After hearing further submissions on behalf of each parent, the district judge ordered the father to pay the mother's coats which were summarily assessed in the amount of �2,468.00.  The father applied for permission to appeal against the costs order.  The appeal was heard by Mr. Justice Holman.  

Mr. Justice Holman went on to find in this case that the District Judge was wrong to find that it was not appropriate for the father to use the court as a means to ascertain the wishes and feelings of his daughter.  He took the view that it was perfectly reasonable and justifiable for the father to have made the application but that it would of course rapidly have become very unreasonable and indeed misconceived to proceed with it a moment beyond the course and conduct of the FHDRA on 14th. March 2012.  If, having heard the report from the Cafcass officer the father had nevertheless persisted with his application then he would soon have been acting with folly but he did not do so.

Mr. Justice Holman did not grant permission to appeal on the grounds of proportionality however he noted that if the matter had been before him he could not conceive that he would have made any costs order if the hearing had been before him."  

Ms Jennings sought to rely on this case and to extrapolate from this case a general principle that the discretion to award costs "should be exercised when a party has acted unreasonably and with folly."

It seems to me that the ratio of this judgment is that proportionality may require the refusal of permission to appeal even if the first instance decision was wrong ( which was the view taken by Holman J in this case.)

Ms. Jennings submitted in writing the following (as set out by Ms. Jennings);

"In that case there was a reasonable F father but in this case we say F acted UNREASONABLY throughout, that he acted with FOLLY.  We go further and say he acted with MALICE.  Certainly we would say that his litigation conduct would justify a costs order and it is the right thing to do.  His original application made on 9th May made without any attempt to discuss with mother, without notice to mother and without notice to us."

What is relied upon is that father told the judge that he believed mother was moving to Northern Cyprus although he knew from 8th May that she was moving to Kent.  In fact in father's statement of 9th May father states very clearly that he thinks mother is moving to Kent.

Ms Jennings further submits that initial application was unreasonable and malicious. She writes,

Ms. Jennings justifies that submission because she states that although Father was given a "great deal of reassurance" he "took the order to the police station and he says was interviewed by CID leading to the police visiting mum in Kent and causing a great deal of distress to her, her husband and the three children."  

Ms Jennings then goes on to say that when the matter came before the District Judge on 16th May, the application was "in effect dismissed" but that is not correct.  The application was compromised by the mother giving undertakings which is a very different matter to the application being dismissed.  

Ms Jennings then relies on the fact that it was unreasonable of father to make an application for residence of K because father has never expressed any concerns about mother's parenting skills.  Further it is relied upon that father should not have continued to a final hearing with his contested application for residence of K, once there was a clear and unequivocal recommendation by the CAFCASS officer Mr. Shields that K remain with mother.  

Miss Jennings continues in her submissions,

"Even as late as yesterday having heard all of the evidence and you asked if he wished to pursue his application he said he did resulting in another day in court, the fourth day of court proceedings mother has had to endure."

So that was the basis of the application put on behalf of mother by Ms Jennings.  

Father told me that he did not really say very much when asked to respond to the application for costs save that he simply said (and this is accepted by Mother) that he  was simply acting as a loving father.  Father also believes that Ms Jennings put forward a summary of costs although again father could not remember and neither could mother.  

The facts and reasons.

Looking at the first set of facts and reasons dated 23rd August 2013 in relation to the substantive Children Act 1989 orders, the following comments were made.

Under the heading "Decision" the Justices find the following,

"We have decided that K is happy and very well looked after by his mother and that despite the best intentions of his father a move would be very detrimental and unsettling for K.  We note that Mr. Shields has no concerns for K in his mother's care and strongly recommended that K remain with his current family unit.  We are therefore going to grant a residence order in favour of mother.  We are going to grant a contact order in favour of father in the same terms agreed on 16th May 2013 and the details are set out above.  It is K's wish that his mother attend the dancing competitions and that his father continues with rugby training.  It is important to have the special interest with each parent.  If either activity interferes with weekend contact the court would expect the parents to negotiate."

It is of note in this context that there is no finding that father has behaved in a reprehensible fashion, unreasonably, with malice with folly or in any other way.  Indeed the only comment relating to father's conduct in the original facts and reasons is the phrase "despite the best intentions of his father."  

Having handed down these facts and reasons the Justices then heard the application for costs as I have described.  Father had just been told of the decision that K would not be living with him.  He told me that he was trying to consider that and clearly he had found it emotionally upsetting.  Even accepting that Ms Jennings had passed the written submissions on costs to him, there was no suggestion by any party that he be given time first of all to consider the judgment handed down or secondly to read through the written submissions or the authority provided.  It appears that Ms Jennings went straight into her application for the costs.  

The hand written notes made by the Justices and signed by the chair of the Magistrates read as follows,

"We have been made aware of CPR 44.3 and have taken into account the points raised by own legal adviser.  We have considered the conduct of all the parties, whether party has succeeded in part, even if not wholly, conduct before as well as during proceedings, whether it was reasonable for a party to raise pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue or the manner in which a party have pursued or defended his case on a particular allegation or issue.  We therefore believe that it is right to award costs to Mother to the sum of �5,155.80 because of Father's tenacity in pursuing a case which had little merit and which he could have discontinued after seeing the CAFCASS report."

There is a written note of the arguments, the note of Miss Jennings' argument is as follows:  

"Say he acted unreasonably and with folly and further with malice.  On 9th May 2013 without notice he made an ex parte application why?

 Civil Procedure Rules essential cases only should be not on notice.  Find it hard to believe a solicitor.  Order made on wrong information he did not tell judge she was moving to Kent.  He knew a judge would not have granted prohibitive steps order had he been honest If judge had not been misled order would not have been granted.  In face of court made an application for residence, District Judge Perusko raised his eyebrows.  Up to move to Kent he had made no such application, he made this spurious application just because he did not consent for move to Kent."

This seems to have been responded to by father.  The note is very much in abbreviated form and reads,

"If folly or spurious are tantamount to school and travel he has to do I am only concerned father.  Have already spent �20k stopping my son going to Cyprus."

Clearly there was a concern at some point by Father that Ms Jennings had intimidated him because Ms Jennings replied "I have not intimidated him, I had just advised him of the risks involved". 

Father then responds "yes, she informed me not three times in the same day". 

The note then reads, "Clerks advice Rule 44:3 CPR read to the bench.

The note concludes,

"We have considered the points raised above and we believe it is right to award costs to mother due to the tenacity of Father, which he could have abandoned after seeing the Guardian's report.  Costs awarded in the sum of �5,155.80 against father to mother.  Father appealed that decision."

I then have the third set of facts and reasons (the second in relation to the costs order) pursuant to the order of His Honour Judge Hughes dated 20th November 2013.

As noted, the magistrates then considered their decision again, one of the magistrates having retired the two remaining magistrates considered their reasons.

At the beginning of the reasons the magistrates set out the submissions by Miss Jennings as follows:

"The solicitor on behalf of Mother stated that the general principle in proceedings is that a losing party would pay the costs in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Rules 44.2,[sic]  However, accepted that in children matters it is less common and the general Rule does not apply but referred to the family proceedings Rules 2010, 28.1 where the court may at any time make such order as to costs as it thinks just.  It was stated that the court had discretion in regard of costs and that discretion should be exercised when a party had acted unreasonably and with folly.  The case of HH v BLW [2012] EWHC 2199 (Fam) wase referred to."

In the "Decision" part of the Facts and reasons the following is said,

"We have been made aware of the Civil Procedure Rules paragraph 44.2 and taken into account the relevant criteria.  We have considered the points raised on behalf of mother in particular to the conduct of father throughout the proceedings and the manner in which the application was pursued.  We find that father was aware that mother intended to move from Milton Keynes when he issued a prohibitive steps application and that move was to Kent.  We believe he pursued his application for residence motivated by this and his tenacity in continuing with the application for residence was driven by his displeasure. 

The Cafcass report dated 8th August 2013 made a clear recommendation for K to continue to reside with mother and for contact to father to continue as currently directed.  Father could have withdrawn his application at that time and saved two days of court hearing and the attendance of Mr. Shields who completed the Cafcass report.  We acknowledge that the Family Procedure Rules of 2010 disapply that part of the Civil Procedure Rules that provides a starting point that the unsuccessful party pays the costs.  In exercising our discretion whether to make such an order we have considered all of the circumstances and the conduct of father throughout the proceedings was both tactical and wholly unreasonable we believe, therefore that it is right to exercise our discretion and award costs to mother in the sum of �5,155.80.  

Analysis and decision.

My concerns about the way in which this matter has been considered are as follows.  Firstly, the Justices were directed in August and in December to  Civil Procedure Rule 44.2(2).  Whilst that may be an interesting background when considering costs, it should only ever be referred to in these circumstances, if there is then a clear direction that it is expressly disapplied by Rule 28.2 of the Family Procedure Rules.  It seems to me that in December the legal advisor did direct or advise the magistrates of this disapplication because that is noted in the decision.  However, I am concerned about the assistance the Justices received in August 2013.  

In the second paragraph of her submissions, Ms. Jennings writes, that "it is less common in children matters and the general Rule does not apply." 

In my judgment, it was the duty of Ms. Jennings to ensure that any reference to Rule 44 .2(2) of the Civil Procedure Rules should have been immediately followed by the disapplication under Rule 28.2 of the Family Proceedings Rules and an express direction that CPR 44.2(2) does not apply. 

Secondly the submission immediately following the reciting of CPR 44.2(2) that "it is less common in children matters" is in my judgment simply wrong.  The starting point is that there should be no order for costs and that departure from this rule is rare.  The phraseology used by Ms. Jennings, does not convey the exceptional nature of the making of such a costs order in this sort of case.  It is most unfortunate that Ms. Jennings did not refer the Justices to the guidance in the Red book.  Had she done so, she may have reminded herself to refer the Justices to R v R , Re T and Re N,A,G and N  which in my judgment would have assisted the Justices greatly in exercising their discretion on this matter.

 Nowhere in Ms Jennings' submissions nor in the reasons handed down by the magistrates both in August and in December 2013, is there any reference to it being unusual for costs to be awarded in children cases.  Nowhere is there a direction that the starting point is that there is no order for costs in Children Act proceedings and that it is rare to depart from that starting point.  

I am further concerned by the reliance that Ms Jennings invited the Justices to place on the case of HH v BLW.  The facts of that case are wholly distinguishable from this case.  That was a case where a father was applying for contact to a child who was rising 16.  It is exceptional for a Section 8 order to be made in respect of a child who has reached the age of 16.  However, even in those circumstances,  Mr. Justice Holman found that the father had no other way of objectively ascertaining the views of his child as to whether she wanted contact with him or not.  Mr Justice Holman took the view that it was perfectly reasonable and justifiable for the father to have made the application but that it would have become unreasonable and indeed misconceived if he had proceeded past the first FHDRA, which the father did not.   Mr Justice Holman would not have made a costs order in those circumstances.  

Ms Jennings invited the Justices to rely on this case first of all to extrapolate a proposition that if a parent continues with litigation post receipt of the recommendation of the Cafcass officer then that is by itself unreasonable.  Further, she appears to extrapolate that the test to be applied is whether a parent has acted with folly. 

In my judgment the Justices were not  addressed on the clearly distinguishing facts of that case.  Secondly in my judgment, undue weight was given to dicta in that case which although may be of assistance to a court as to the sort of conduct that may be relied upon when considering conduct, it does not form a basic test namely "acting with folly", which should be given precedence over the starting point which is there should be no order for costs in Children Act cases, or that it is unusual to make a costs order.  In my judgment the learned magistrates misdirected themselves as to the starting point when considering whether to exercise their discretion as to whether a costs order should have been made.

Nowhere in Ms. Jennings's written submissions is there a direction that although CPR 424.2(2) is expressly disapplied, the court must take into account CPR 44.2(4), (5) and (6)

Ms. Jennings should have applied the facts of this case to CPR 44.2 (4) and (5) rather than placing undue weight on a particular authority which as I have said is very specific on its facts.  

One of the matters that the court will have regard to is the conduct of the parties and as I have already set out when reading through the case of Re T the conduct of the party includes conduct before as well as during the proceedings and the efforts made if any before and during the proceedings, in order to try and resolve the dispute. 

I am particularly concerned about the equality of arms in this case.  The father was not represented throughout these proceedings.  He had had experience of mother wishing to relocate K to Northern Cyprus.  He had been involved in litigation for three days to oppose permission being given for K to leave the jurisdiction.  In my judgment it is therefore unsurprising that this father,  given that history and learning indirectly that  mother was moving from her home and also knowing that a holiday in Northern Cyprus was booked for that year, that this father became fearful that K would be removed from his home without Father's knowledge.  It is not unreasonable for this father to have been extremely concerned about where mother was moving K to whether it was within this jurisdiction or not.

Reliance is placed by Mother on father's unreasonable behaviour in making an ex parte application for a prohibited steps order on 9th. May 2013 and the Justices relied on those submissions as part of their reasoning for making a costs order.  However, the Justices did not consider the effect on this father of the previous litigation history nor did they consider that this mother had unilaterally decided to move this child away from the area and away from the school without any consultation with his father who holds parental responsibility for K.  Nowhere in any of the submissions or in either sets of reasons has this behavior on the part of mother been considered and the impact on father of this.  This mother moved this child knowing that father would be concerned about it and knowing that it would ride a coach and horses through a settled contact regime, namely that father saw this child once every four days either through visiting contact or through weekend contact.  It hardly seems surprising to me that father with this history and with this lack of consultation went into court on an emergency basis seeking a prohibitive steps order that mother cannot remove this child from the jurisdiction.  It is quite wrong to say that father did not inform the court that mother's plans were to move to Kent.  It states it plainly in his statement.  The point is that father did not know what Mother's settled plans were because she had not seen fit to discuss them at all.   In terms of that lack of communication I know not where the fault lies in terms of historical difficulties but the sad situation is that these parents or the relationship between them is so poor, that there is really no communication at all.  However, in my judgment none of that justifies mother removing this child from his home and his school without any reference to father at all and in my judgment that conduct by mother is to be deprecated.  Frankly if there was any thought about a costs order being made in May 2013, in my judgment there may have been a strong argument for a costs order being made against mother.  

I therefore find it very difficult to understand why the learned magistrates took into account a hearing in May 2013, when father had only just learnt that his son was being removed from the area and from his school.  He thought it was for Kent, he was unsure and he had a history of mother wanting to relocate this child to Northern Cyprus.  In my judgment when the full picture has emerged no criticism should have been made towards father and it should have played no part in the consideration as to whether a costs order should have been made at the end of the August hearing. However the learned magistrates have placed weight on this having heard the submissions of Miss Jennings.  

The second major plank of the decisions made by the magistrates is that father should not have continued with his application once he had received the Cafcass report.  In my judgment, if the courts were justified in making orders for costs against parents who continued with their litigation after receipt of the Cafcass reports, costs orders would be made in almost every Children Act case.  It is a very common occurrence that when parents receive Cafcass reports, one party or another does not accept those reports and they wish to challenge those reports.  In my judgment there is nothing in the FPR or case law to suggest that a lack of acceptance of a Cafcass report in itself would justify a costs order being made.  It may be a factor to be considered on the particular facts of any case.  

The Magistrates state that father unreasonably continued litigation due to his "displeasure."  The Magistrates make no reference to Mother's lack of discussion or consultation with father about K's relocation or the effect such a relocation would have on his contact schedule.  Furthermore, in my judgment, Father had a legitimate concern that he wished to raise with Mr. Shields in cross examination, namely that K had missed, he says, up to 30 days off school and that that is something he wished to ask the Cafcass officer about.  Father's case was that he wanted to be near to K's school in order to ensure K's regular attendance.   In my judgment it is the sign of a loving father to question why his son has taken so much time off school.  I understand mother's argument that K has a particular and unique talent which should be encouraged and that any absence from school is authorised for that reason.  However, that does not render father's concern unreasonable.

My next concern is that the magistrates seem to have made the costs orders based on the father's tenacity.  In my judgment tenacity, if indeed that is what father has shown, is not in itself sufficient to make a costs order against Father.  There was no criticism of this father in the reasons of the substantive application that would justify the making of a costs order and indeed the only comment made about father's conduct was that he had acted "with the best of intentions."

Finally I am very concerned that the magistrates simply accepted the figure of �5,155.80.  

I note that in the December reasons it is recorded that "We considered the advice from our legal adviser contained in para44.2 which was read in full in open court."  It is unclear whether that means that all 7 subsections of that rule were read out.  

I note that there is reference in the hand written notes in August to factors set out under CPR 44.2 (4) and (5) but there is no such reference in the December reasons to those specific sections nor to CPR 44.2(6) which specifically requires a court to consider whether a party should be made to pay a proportion of the other party's costs and the factors to be taken into account in apportioning costs.

It seems that Ms Jennings provided a breakdown of the costs but the magistrates have not gone through those, there has been no assessment of the costs, there has been no consideration as to which part of the costs apply to which part of the proceedings and there was no consideration by the magistrates as to whether it would be appropriate to order only part of the costs be paid by father and why the entire sum of �5,155.80 pursuant to CPR44.2(6). 

In my judgment this was a significant failing on the part of the magistrates.  They were not asked to do so by Ms Jennings in her written submissions.  I know not whether they were advised to do so by the legal advisor.

In my judgment it is worth noting (what should be obvious) namely that where there is a litigant in person, there is a particular duty on all advocates and indeed on the court, whether it be magistrates or a Judge to ensure at every stage of the proceedings that there is equality of arms and that a litigant in person fully understands the nature of the proceedings and fully understands what the arguments are.  I am very concerned that the full background of this case was not fully before the court.  Father clearly mentioned the litigation history of the relocation to Cyprus and the fact that mother did not tell father of the proposed move to Kent.  Had he been represented, it is likely that the relevance of those matters would have been put far more forcefully within the application for costs.  It seems to me that no or insufficient weight was put on that history and on Mother's conduct in making unilateral decisions about K's care arrangements when considering the costs application.  Had these matters been properly considered, I find it very difficult to accept that the Justices would have exercised their discretion in the way that they did.   In my judgment if Ms. Jennings sought to rely upon that application, it was only fair that the court had understood Mother's conduct, which I do criticise, which caused Father to turn to litigation.    

If it is correct that there was no adjournment between Ms. Jennings serving Father with her written submissions and the application for costs, I am concerned by that.  Such a failing does not affect my overall decision in this case, but it is a matter of concern to me that a father who is coming to terms with the decision is then expected to deal with such an application, supported by written submissions and case law at short notice.

I am concerned by the written submissions of Ms. Jennings to the Justices and in my judgment she did not assist the court as she could and indeed should have done.  In my judgment the learned magistrates misdirected themselves as to the tests to be applied and therefore any balancing act they then undertook was flawed.  I am further concerned that these magistrates did not consider whether the costs of �5,155.80 was reasonable and whether only part of the costs should be awarded.  There was no assessment of the costs, there was no consideration of how those costs were arrived at and there was no consideration as to whether it would have been just and reasonable to award part of those costs against father rather than the entire amount.  Ms Jennings in my submission should have pointed out to the magistrates that they had a duty to consider at what point in the proceedings the costs had accrued and that they could award part costs.   

I am concerned that there was no careful analysis of the factors set out under CPR 44.2(4)(5)and (6) as set out above.

I am concerned about the submissions made in respect of the case of HH v BLW and the guidance to have been drawn from this case.   I have said the facts are easily distinguished from this case and in my judgment had father been represented, a very different approach would have been taken as to the assistance that could properly have been given by that case.

For all of the above reasons, in my judgment the decision of the magistrates to award costs in the sum of �5,155.80 was wrong.  It was wrong because the magistrates were misdirected as to the proper test.  It was wrong because the magistrates did not apply or did not place sufficient weight on the relevant factors.  It was wrong because the Justices failed to place any or sufficient weight on the reasons why father commenced litigation in May 2013 and that any analysis of the facts would have shown that Mother's conduct at this time fell far short of a reasonable parent acting in partnership with another parent holding parental responsibility.

It was wrong because the magistrates did not consider whether part or the entire amount claimed should be awarded.  It was wrong because the finding of the court was that father acted with the best of intentions and the original findings in the facts and reasons of 23rd August do not sit well with the subsequent facts and reasons handed down on 19th December.  I would go so far as to say that given the finding that the father had acted with "the best of intentions" the subsequent decision then to award costs was perverse.  

For all of those reasons I am going to allow the appeal and I discharge the order for costs against father in the sum of �5,155.80.  I know that both parties are extremely distressed by these proceedings, I know that mother has spent a great deal of money on these proceedings and has spent money after the August hearing preparing for the appeal.  In my judgment parties should be advised very clearly when they embark on seeking representation in private law proceedings is that it is unusual to recover costs in private law procedings.

As I have noted,  Mother told me that in her view father has made her life a living hell for the last six years.  I am going to make no comment on where the fault lies as between these two parents save that in my judgment this mother must have known and foreseen litigation by this father when she decided unilaterally to move this child out of the county and move schools with no reference whatsoever to this father who clearly wants to be very involved in K's life.  

I sincerely hope that this latest round in litigation between these parents will not disrupt contact between K and his father. Mother may have wholly negative feelings towards father but she must keep them to herself.  I was very concerned when mother told me during the appeal that K is concerned that they are going to be homeless because of this appeal.  Mother should not be discussing the finances arising out of this litigation with K.  He is only 8 years old.  Mother explained that K is living in the household and has seen her crying due to the stress of these proceedings.  Whilst I feel compassion for her this suggests to me that she is involving K in her distress.  She must do her very best to stop that.  I sincerely hope that father can accept that K is living with mother with frequent contact to father.  However, that does not mean he does not remain a very significant person in K's life. 

The one matter that both parents were prepared to agree is they seek a variation of the contact order.  Fortnightly K spends the weekend with his father.  On the relevant Friday father drives down to Kent and picks K up from school.  On a Sunday night mother goes to pick K up from father's.  There seems to have been confusion as to whether the pickup point was father's home or the Milton Keynes bus station, suffice to say mother does not want to go to father's home, father does not want to go to the bus station.   However both parties were able to agree that in future mother would pick K up from the Budgens store in Grange Farm at 6 o'clock.  He was also able to agree that he will be on his own and that his partner and none of his partner's friends would be with him.  Therefore by the consent of both of the parties, I am varying the contact order simply to change the pickup point for mother on the relevant Sundays, other than that I am not disturbing, varying or discharging any part of the contact order.  Therefore the orders of the court are as follows:

(1)The appeal is allowed and the order for costs against father is discharged.

(2)	The contact order is varied, only to the extent that on Sundays mother is to pick K up from [agreed venue] 6 o'clock.  Father is to attend with K on his own and without the presence of any other person.   

(3)	There is no order for costs arising out of the appeal.

APPROVED JUDGMENT

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with A, who was born on 24th January 2009, so A is now 5.  

 
A's mother is B and her father is C.  

 
The local authority's key social worker is D and A's CAFCASS guardian is E.  

 
This is an application by F for a care order issued on 30th October 2013 and for a placement order issued on 24th February 2014.

 
The parents have attended this morning for an issues resolution hearing.  Each of them with, if I may say, considerable bravery, has recognised that the evidence would be very likely to preclude me from agreeing that A could return to their care. Whilst they would prefer that I made a care order and declined to make a placement order, they do not formally challenge the local authority's plans for A.  Ultimately, their position is that they do not formally consent but nor do they oppose the applications. In such a very unhappy situation, that is a process of reasoning which I hope I  understand 

 
A was removed from her parents' care very early in life.  There was a thorough process of assessment in the course of care proceedings, which were allocated to me. In October 2009, by consent, I returned A to her parents' care subject to a supervision order.  That order lapsed in March 2011.  After a period where A's care was entirely satisfactory, the situation began to deteriorate, probably coinciding with the point at which C made the decision to seek employment outside of the home.

 
The threshold criteria are set out at A4 of the bundle.  I will not distress the parents by repeating the details in the course of this judgment. It is clear that by 10th October 2013, A had been assaulted by her father and that home conditions were very poor indeed. It then emerged that A had made various complaints to teachers and staff at school about previous assaults upon her and incidents of violence occurring between her parents.  Those earlier complaints were unfortunately not referred to Social Services.  I find that the threshold criteria at  s31 of the Children Act are clearly established

 
Since October 2013, A has been placed with foster carers where she has thrived. Various assessments of family members have been undertaken, alongside careful assessments of the parents.  Unfortunately all of those assessments have proved negative. 

 
The local authority, recognising the likely difficulties in finding an adoptive family for A, are prepared to undertake a concurrent search for both prospective adopters and long term foster carers.

 
In practical terms there are, in effect, three potential options for A's future:  a return to the care of one of her parents; a care order enabling the local authority to place her with long term foster carers; or a placement order enabling the local authority to search for prospective adopters.

 
My starting point must be that the best place for any child is with a parent or, in default of that possibility, with a member of the extended family unless there are strong welfare grounds to prefer an alternative.  In weighing the three options A's welfare must be my paramount concern.  I have reminded myself of the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of the Children Act.  

 
In terms of the application for a placement order again A's welfare remains my paramount concern and in this exercise I must consider her welfare throughout her life, applying the provisions of section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, the welfare checklist.  If I were to conclude that a placement order accords with A's welfare I will then have to decide whether her welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of her parents to the making of such an order.

 
It is trite law that I must be satisfied that any orders I make are a lawful, necessary, proportionate and reasonable response to A's sad predicament.  The granting of a care order, let alone endorsing a plan for adoption, represents a drastic curtailment of the rights of these parents and of A under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which can only be justified by pressing concerns for her welfare.  However, in construing both the Convention and domestic law I have the assistance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Re: B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33 followed by a number of decisions in the Court of Appeal.  Those cases firmly re-emphasise that a placement for adoption is a "very extreme thing" and "a last resort" to be approved only when nothing else will do.  Both domestic and Convention law do require a high degree of justification before adoption can be endorsed as "necessary", the term in the Convention, or "required" in the Adoption and Children Act.  

 
Applying those legal principles I am entirely satisfied that it would not accord with the welfare of A to be returned to the care of either of her parents.  

 
The more difficult balance lies between the granting or declining of the application for a placement order.  A has had an extraordinarily difficult start to life.  She deserves the opportunity of a stable, secure and permanent home.  The disadvantages of foster care are carefully enumerated in the guardian's analysis which I accept.  For a little girl of 5 the prospects of her being a child of the state, the responsibility of this local authority, for the next 13 years is not an appealing one.  Foster carers may be overtaken by all the ordinary vicissitudes of life, they may decide to cease fostering, local authority policies may change.  

 
Adoption is no panacea and I recognise that, inherent in such a placement, there will be losses for this little girl.  Particularly significant will be the loss of direct contact with her parents and also with her 7 half-siblings.  O, born in November 2008, has already been adopted.

 
However, weighing those disadvantages against the prospects of a carefully selected and suitable adoptive placement, in my judgment its is A's need for stability and security which must predominate.  I am satisfied that a placement for adoption accords with A's welfare throughout her life. Indeed, the position really is so clear that I must dispense with the consent of her parents to the making of a placement order on the basis that her welfare requires me to do so.

 
I will direct a transcript of this judgment at the joint expense of all of the parties.  I reserve any further applications in relation to A to myself unless geographically that is inconvenient for any prospective adopters.  I will grant local authority leave to disclose any relevant documents from these proceedings to prospective adopters.

 
I hope that if, in the years ahead, A comes to read this imperfect extempore judgment she will appreciate that, whatever their difficulties and shortcomings, both of her parents loved her very much indeed.  They wanted the very best for her and the fact that they have not contested these proceedings is a reflection of their realism and their love for her, which is very much to be commended.

 
B and C, I hope the local authority will be able to give you details of some of the independent support services which are available out there.  Now may be too soon but, in time, I hope you will be able to take advantage of professional help to begin to cope with all of the dreadful things that have happened to you.

HER HONOUR JUDGE COX: 

This is a final hearing in care proceedings commenced by the London Borough of Wandsworth, the Local Authority, on 30th September 2013 in respect of B, who was born on 27th September 2013.  He is now six months old. 

 

His mother is A G.  She was born on 14th May 1982.  She is 31 years old.  She is a woman of black African Caribbean heritage.  She is the first respondent to the Local Authority's applications for a care order in respect of B and a placement order.  The application for a placement order was issued by the Local Authority on 5th March 2014, and I am satisfied that the mother and B's guardian have both had proper notice of that application.  

 

B's father's identity is unknown.  The mother has never revealed the father's identity, and it is not clear to me whether she is unable to reveal his identity or whether she does not wish to.  I am quite satisfied that it would be impossible to require her to disclose his identity, and that there is no way of knowing B's paternal heritage or his family.  

 

The reason for that is that B's mother has a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, which is complicated by chronic substance misuse.  She has a serious history of mental illness, and she is currently the subject of detention under s.3 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  It is therefore clear that she suffers from a recognised psychiatric illness, and that she is a danger to herself, or to others.  Although she has periods of lucidity, and has been able throughout these proceedings, either personally or through her solicitors, to make her views known, she is not able to retain a sufficient focus on the reality of the situation in respect of B, or her own position, to give coherent instructions or to engage in the litigation.  

 

Having considered the psychiatric reports of Drs. Turner and Magioli, and the expert option of Dr. Bashir, I made a determination that the mother lacked litigation capacity on 27th November 2013.  I have had no evidence that would cause me to revisit that determination.  The mother's situation has not changed.  She has at various times during the litigation indicated an intention to challenge her detention under s.3 of the Mental Health Act, but such challenges have either been unsuccessful or have not taken place. The fact that AG is the subject of detention under s 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 does not necessarily demonstrate that AG lacks litigation capacity. There is a presumption that a person has litigation capacity, which may only be displaced by cogent evidence. That evidence was provided to the court on the 27th November 2013. The situation has been consistently monitored by the court and by the Official Solicitor, who acts as AG's Litigation Friend. AG is represented at this final hearing by counsel instructed by the Official Solicitor.

 

B was born on 27th September 2013 by elected caesarean section, and fairly shortly after his birth, less than 24 hours after his birth, he was separated from his mother and placed in foster care, where he has remained.  His removal from his mother's care was necessary to promote his welfare and to protect him from significant harm. His mother is not able properly to care for herself in a reliable and consistent calm way because of her illness, and there was a likelihood that if B remained in her care, even under supervision, he would suffer significant physical and emotional harm.  

 

The mother has had two older children, A, who is now 13, and S, who is now 10, nearly 11.  They were both subject to emergency protection orders, and care proceedings were commenced in respect of them in 2004.  The concerns related to their wellbeing, centred on AG's ill health, and a risk to them of significant harm, both physical and emotional.  The care proceedings resulted in a residence order being made in respect of each of the children that they should reside with their father and that order was made on 21st October 2005.  There is no direct contact between A, S and their mother.  

 

The facts in relation to the mother's mental health history, and the history of her family, are tragic.  The maternal grandmother has a longstanding history of alcohol addiction, and has been known to use other non prescription drugs.  The mother and her brother were the subject of care proceedings in relation to significant harm, and the mother's brother was removed from the maternal grandmother's care and spent most of his childhood in care himself.  Later, he suffered from mental health difficulties and tragically took his own life.  There is a genetic history of systematic lupus erythematosus, and there is also a sickle cell trait history.  Therefore, B has a significant hereditary genetic heritage of addiction, a sickle cell trait, and lupus.  

 

B, as I have said, was removed from his mother's care shortly after his birth and placed, once he was discharged from hospital, in foster care.  He has remained with the same foster family throughout, where he has thrived.  He is described as a happy, undemanding baby, full of smiles.  Physically, he is considered to be slightly delayed, in that he is still not sitting.  However, children develop at different paces, and it is impossible to say whether he has any developmental delay yet.  He has made a good secure attachment to his foster mother and is much loved by his foster family.  

 

A G has continued to have contact with her son.  That contact has been monitored carefully, and has been variable in quality, but often A G has been able to show tenderness and love towards B.  However, on occasions B, who, as I have said, is a contented baby, has displayed distress, over-stimulation, and insecurity on his return from contact with his mother.  It may be that A G showers him with her attention in the time that she has available to demonstrate how much she loves B, and that as a result he becomes unsettled and over-stimulated.  

 

I begin, because the law requires it, and B's given rights require it, and because it is right in a civilised society, with the proposition that children are best looked after during their childhood by their parents, and that the state has no power to intervene in private family life unless a child's welfare demands it, because the child requires protection, and for his or her welfare to be promoted by such intervention.  

 

I am satisfied from all the facts that I have read, which are unchallenged by any party in these proceedings, and are set out fully in the guardian's initial analysis, and in her final analysis and recommendations, and in the report of Dr. Charlotte Harrison in respect of the mother, and in the reports of three separate social workers who have been responsible for B's welfare since his birth, that B is likely to suffer significant physical and emotional harm were he to be placed in his mother's care.  

 

Because this court is required to scrutinise whether or not B could be brought up by his mother, I caused enquiries to be made at an early stage in these proceedings, in October 2013, of a specialist residential unit, Coombe Wood, which specialises in assessing the parenting capacity of parents who have mental health difficulties, or illness.  It seemed to me that the only way in which it would be possible safely to assess A G's ability to care for B without separating her from her son, or continuing separation, would be to approach such a residential unit.  This was done, and Coombe Wood, having read the facts relating to the case, responded that they were unable to provide an assessment of B with his mother because A G herself was not able to look after herself, and that efforts should be concentrated on assisting her to be able to become independent herself, and that it was not viable for her to be assessed with B.  I am satisfied that that was the case then and continues still to be case.  

 

During the first five months of these proceedings, A G has been detained in a medium secure setting, although she has been able to have unsupervised day release from her hospital.  On occasions when she has returned to hospital, it has been demonstrated that she has tested positive for street drugs.  

 

Recently, she has been transferred to a lower security placement where she is going to be rehabilitated.  It is a rehabilitation unit attached to the Springfield Hospital, and he consultant psychiatrist is Charlotte Harrison, who I have mentioned.  There it is hoped that A G will be able to be supported and treated so that she will be able to live in semi supported accommodation within the community.  The timeframe for that may be about six months.  But it is, from the evidence I have read, quite unclear as to the exact timescales when A G might be able to move into the community and live in a supported way.  I am quite satisfied that there is no prospect of her being able to look after B in a consistently safe, secure and nurturing way for a considerable period, if at all.  

 

The facts set out in the materials to which I have referred clearly give me a jurisdiction to make a care order and a placement order under s 31 of the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  In order for such orders to be proportionate I must be satisfied that they are the only orders which will secure and promote B's future welfare and safety, and that it is necessary to make such draconian orders.  I remind myself in particular that a placement order is a draconian order to make.  It is a very serious interference with B's right to family life, and to be brought up by his mother, and a very serious interference with the mother's right to look after her child.  

 

It is quite clear to me, from having read the analysis of the s.1(3) Welfare Checklist, contained in B's Guardian Jenny Ryan's final analysis and recommendations, and her analysis of the s.1(4) checklist in the 2002 Adoption and Children Act, that only a care order and a placement order will secure B's safety and future welfare.  

 

In so saying, I have in particular been very careful throughout the course of these proceedings to investigate fully the possibility that B could be cared for by his extended family, and I have required the Local Authority to make serious and thorough investigations of the maternal extended family to see if there were any person able to offer B a safe and happy childhood.  The investigations made by B's social worker in the Autumn of 2013, in respect of four people put forward by the mother, were thorough and more than merely precursory.  A number of opportunities were given to the family to respond to enquiries by the Local Authority as to whether they would be able to care for B during his childhood.  

 

The social worker, Karen Miller-Fields, has provided a detailed statement dated 18th November 2013, in which she sets out the various investigations and enquiries made by her and the Local Authority to assess those people.  Those people were the maternal grandmother, the maternal aunt, a relative called C, and T G.  Those were the named extended family members investigated.  Miss Miller-Fields was persistent in her communications with each of the members of the family, giving them a number of opportunities to respond and to engage in the assessment process.  In the end, no family member has been able to sustain the assessment process.   In particular, the maternal grandmother, who was the focus of the family's proposals for the care of B, was unable to sustain the detailed assessment required.  This is unsurprising since the circumstances of B's placement in foster care reminded her painfully and acutely of the removal of her own children.  She freely admitted her history of alcoholism, and described her battle with alcohol as currently being a daily battle.  Furthermore, there were concerns about the way in which she treated her children, emotionally and physically, which was the reason why A G's brother was removed from the grandmother's care.  

 

I am satisfied that no further investigations could have been made to find a family placement suitable to promote B's welfare during his childhood, and I am satisfied that Miss Ryan's analysis of s.1(4), in particular sub-section (f) of sub-section 1(4), has been thoroughly carried out.    

 

Miss Ryan has also suggested that the Local Authority should amend its care plan to reflect how it is to manage contact between A G and B until he is placed for adoption, and a plan for a gradual reduction of the mother's contact with B until a baseline of monthly supervised contact until placement has been agreed.  The issue of contact between B and his much older half siblings, A and S, has also been considered.  That will now be specified in the care plan as being indirect contact.  It will be important for B, and for A and S, to understand their relationship as part of life story work.  

 

On behalf of the mother, the Official Solicitor, through Miss Neathey, the mother's counsel, has asked that active steps be taken to help the mother to take up the indirect contact which is planned.  I am satisfied that whilst the mother engages with adult mental health services, that there will be liaison between the children's specialist services of the Local Authority and the adult mental health team to assist the mother to exercise indirect contact.  This too will be important for B.  

 

The Official Solicitor has, rightly, identified that although I have made a declaration that the mother lacks litigation capacity, I have not made such a declaration, or decision, in relation to her capacity to give or withhold her consent to a placement order.  I have on a number of occasions at the various interlocutory hearings in these proceedings, listened to A G when she has come to court and has spoken on her own behalf in the presence of her solicitor.  She has also given evidence to me.  I am clear that whilst she definitely lacks litigation capacity, she does not lack the capacity to understand what adoption is, what the Local Authority's proposals are in relation to B, and to object to them, which she does, since she believes that she is able to look after B.  This is, of course, something into which she lacks insight, as she does into her own predicament.  However, I am quite clear that she is able to withhold her consent.  Therefore, it falls to the court to consider whether her consent should be dispensed with.  I must consider whether or not B's welfare throughout his life requires that I should dispense with A G's consent to his being placed for adoption. 

 

Everything I have read drives me to the conclusion that B's welfare interests throughout his life require that he should be made the subject of a placement order, and that he should be placed for adoption, where he will be claimed for life by a new family.  I am informed that there is a family under consideration, a family who are already approved as adopters, and are approved to adopt more than one child.  They have already adopted one child and have demonstrated interest in B's profile.  They are suitable in terms of heritage, in that the mother is black English.  The Local Authority, therefore, has already, through a nationwide adoption agency, identified one possible suitable placement, and notwithstanding B's difficult genetic profile, I have no doubt that within a relatively short period he will be found a family who will claim him for life.  He clearly very much needs love, stability, nurturing, and stimulation.  He has formed a very secure attachment to his current foster family, and his next move should be the only move he has to make, and the only loss he has to suffer of that kind during his childhood. 

 

	It seems to me that it is demonstrably in B's interests that he be made 

 
	the subject of a placement order since neither his mother nor any family member is able to care for him.  There are no arguments that have been advanced, or that I have been able to identify, which would displace that requirement.  Therefore, I dispense with A G's consent to the placement order.  I make a care order in respect of B to the London Borough of Wandsworth, I make a placement order in respect of him, and I endorse the order for the disclosure of identified documents to any adoption agency and prospective adopters so that they may understand the full nature of B's heritage.

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with three children: 

 

D, a female child, born on 25th May 1998 who is 15; 

E, a female child born on 15th March 2001 who is 12 and; 

F, a male child born on 28th May 2006 and he is 7.  

The mother of the three children is B, their father is C.

 

The Local Authority's key social worker is K and the children's guardian, J.

 

This is an application for care orders in relation to all three children, dated 5th November 2013.  

 

The parents have steadfastly declined to involve themselves in the care proceedings.  They have not instructed solicitors, they have not filed evidence and they have not yet attended court.  I am satisfied that they have been informed of this hearing, that they know that they should be here and that  they understand the  implications of their absence.  They have made a conscious decision not to attend. 

 

These children have three older siblings: L, born in 1996; M in 1994 and; N in 1992

 

I am satisfied on the basis of everything I have read that the threshold criteria pursuant to section 31 of the Children Act 1989 is established.  I am satisfied that each of the three children with whom I am concerned have suffered ill-treatment and neglect as a result of which their physical, intellectual, emotional, social and behavioural development has been impaired.  Each of the children's physical and mental health has also been damaged and they have also each been harmed by seeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another; there have been repeated incidents of violence within the home involving the parents and the older siblings as well as these three children.

 

I find the underlying facts relevant to the s31 threshold criteria to be as follows: 

 

(1) There is a long and distressing history of the parents' failure to meet the most basic needs of their children.  The pattern of profound parental neglect dates back at least 13 years during which period the Local Authority has repeatedly been involved. It  is depressing to record that the first referral to the Local Authority children services department in in relation to the neglectful and chaotic environment in which D, E M, and L were obliged to live. was in 2001  

 (2) The children have been exposed to or have suffered actual violence within the family home on regular occasions, the most serious known to the Local Authority being as follows: 

(i)	On 5th August 2002 the mother assaulted the children; 

(ii)	On 29th September 2002 the mother stabbed the father and threatened the children with a knife; 

(iii)	On 9th December 2007 N smashed windows at the property; 

(iv)	In May 2013 N assaulted his mother; 

(v)	On 2nd September 2013 E was assaulted by a neighbour, being subjected to punching; 

(vi)	On 26th September 2013 D was assaulted by his mother.  

(3) The parents have failed to ensure that the children's health needs are met and have failed to ensure they are taken to essential health appointments.  Each of the children suffered painful dental decay.  The mother also failed to take E to hospital to be medically examined following the assault I have already referred to on 2nd September 2013 becse she was frightened that this would "incriminate her".  Nonetheless she saw fit to seek medical attention for herself.  

(4) The parents have failed to provide a safe and secure home for the children.  The family home has been used to deal illicit drugs.  On 26th May 2009 N was found to have 19 wraps of heroin and 13 wraps of cocaine in his possession.  He and his brother M both were sentenced to custody for possession of class A drugs and intent to supply those drugs from the family home.  

(5) The parents have failed consistently to provide a clean and safe home for the children.  Conditions have frequently been poor, hazardous and without adequate food and furniture. 

(6) The mother and father, the parents, have failed to ensure that the children's personal hygiene is to an appropriate standard.  The children have been subjected to flea bites, have smelt of urine, have been unclean, have been dressed in dirty and smelly clothing and suffer with head lice.  

(7) The parents have failed to ensure that the children attend school regularly. D was not accessing any educational provision at  all.  The parents  have not engaged in a plan devised to support D's return to education.  

(8) The parents have failed to engage with the support services provided to assit them to meet any of the childrren's basic needs. Those services have included the Family Intervention Support Service, Home Start, the Antisocial Behaviour team, the Early Intervention Team, the Youth Offending service, CAMHS and child protection plans.  They  have failed to make any changes to their lifestyles which would be conducive to caring for the children.

The children were belatedly removed from their parents' care and accommodated by the Local Authority on 26th September 2013.  D did not wish to be placed with foster carers and went to live with P who is his cousin.  I have read an assessment of P and I am satisfied that she is offering D a very good standard of care indeed.  E and F have been placed together with foster carers where they have settled well and are making significant progress, depite the level of harm which both  children but E, in particular, are striving to overcome.

 

Contact was arranged on two occasions each week.  The parents have attended sporadically thereby causing distress to E and F.  Contact has now been reduced to once a week.  Even so, the parents have been unable to attend consistently.  It appears that their tenancy has been abandoned and it is suspected that they may have moved to live in Blackpool.

 

It is the Local Authority's current plan that D be made the subject of a residence order to P and be provided with support and services by way of a supervision order.  That is not a plan upon which P has had the opportunity to take any legal advice and is a plan which is causing her some legitimate anxiety, because she greatly values the support of the Local Authority, particularly in dealing with other members of D's family.  

 

As I have indicated in discussions with the advocates, it is crucial that D's placement with P be maintained.  There are few acceptable alternatives for him. In those circumstances I will adjourn the Local Authority's application in relation to D until 1st April 2014. By that  hearing, P will have had the opportunity of legal advice, K can organise some meetings within the family to set down boundaries as to P's position vis-�-vis D and the guardian will investigate further and provide a position statement.

 

In relation to E and F, in determining whch  course best meets their future needs,  their welfare individually and collectively is my paramount concern and I have reminded myself of the provisions of section 1(3) of the Children Act 1989, the welfare checklist.  I have also reminded myself that any interference with E and F's right to respect for their family life, must be in accordance with the law, must be proportionate and must be justified by overriding concern for their welfare.  

 

I am satisfied on the basis of everything that I have read that the Local Authority's plan for E and F is the best that can be achieved in the circumstances, namely that they remain in foster care throughout their minority.  The Local Authority are committed to maintaining the current foster placement which has been so successful, but quite properly inform me that there is a residual doubt as to whether the current foster carers are prepared to offer a home to both children throughout their minority.  Those are matters for the management of the Local Authority in the years ahead, with the involment of the independent reviewing officer and certainly do not preclude me from making a care order at this stage.

 

I am satisfied that the Local Authority's plans for contact to the parents to be reduced to six times per year during school holidays are consistent with the need for E and F to settle and put down roots in their foster home and it also reduces the scope for them being disappointed by their parents' failure to attend.  

 

In all of those circumstances, I record that I approve the Local Authority's care plans and  make care orders in relation to E and F.  

 

I know that there will be a handover between J and the independent reviewing officer.  I would like us to identify some of the issues which will need to be addressed during future reviews along with  the docuemtns which the IRO  will need to  read, for recital in the order.   

 

I will reserve any further applications to any of these children to myself.  I will make the usual orders in relation to the costs so far as E and F are concerned.

I	INTRODUCTION
THE JUDGE:  I am concerned once again with D, who was born on 16th April 2009 so is now rising 5. This judgment should be read alongside my judgments of 19th August 2013 and 31st October 2013.  

 
I hope that B, the mother, and C, the maternal grandmother, will again forgive me if I again refer to them as "the mother" and "the grandmother".  

 
Following the departure of the key  social worker J immediately after the last hearing this case seems to have been managed within the Local Authority by her team manager, K.  

 
D's Cafcass guardian remains L.  

 
At the conclusion of the hearing in October, I made a final care order in relation to D but adjourned the Local Authority's application for a placement order, issued on 2nd September 2013, until 27th January 2014.  As will be apparent from my last judgment, I had thought that D's placement with her foster carers would, by then, have weathered any early difficulties. I anticipated that the foster carers would be in a position, as they had intended, to make a long-term commitment to D by way of applying for a special guardianship order.  I had hoped that it would be possible for the Local Authority to apply to withdraw the placement order application at the adjourned hearing on that basis.  

 
Sadly, however, when the case came before me on 27th January it was apparent that the Local Authority sought to pursue its application for a Placement Order.  That application is firmly opposed by the mother and the maternal grandmother but it is now supported by the guardian.  Having directed the filing of evidence, I listed the matter for an urgent contested hearing on 13th February 2014.  I was unable to conclude evidence and submissions on that date and the case was re-listed today. 

 
I have heard oral evidence from K and from the guardian.  The mother and grandmother have been present throughout.  They have not chosen to give oral evidence, although I have read their written statements and their position was very clearly expressed by counsel on their behalf.  

 
II	THE AGREED BACKGROUND
Since my judgment in October, D has remained with Mr�and Mrs�M, her foster carers.  Accordingly, she has now been with them for a period of some six months.  Contact to her mother and grandmother has taken place on a reducing basis; it is currently set at  once per month with a plan to reduce it to school holidays, about six times a year.  

 
Sadly, everything has not proceeded smoothly for D. Her behaviour has proved challenging.  On one occasion the foster carers gave notice on the placement only to be persuaded subsequently to withdraw that notice.  On another occasion they were narrowly persuaded not to give notice.  Their anxieties have centred particularly upon the impact of D's presence and behaviour  upon their own child, who is some 2 years older than D.  A referral to CAMHS has been made to provide appropriate psychological support for D and her carers.  The mother, grandmother and guardian have all been active in doing their best to reassure D and to help her to settle with her foster carers and the last few weeks have proved somewhat better than the period leading up until Christmas.

 
In bald summary, the foster carers have themselves concluded that it would be preferable for D to be adopted.  They have declined to put themselves forward as prospective special guardians, let alone as adopters.  They have indicated a willingness to continue to care for D as foster carers whilst prospective adopters are sought.  If adopters cannot be identified, they will re-consider their position and it seems very likely that they will then apply to be approved as D's long-term foster carers.  At present they are unable to offer more than that.

 
III	THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
I will not reiterate what I set out under this heading in my judgment of October 2013, although I have continued to bear all of the relevant principles of law firmly in mind including the authorities cited therein and the references to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 
I reiterate  that in determining the Local Authority's application for a placement order, D's welfare throughout her life must be my paramount concern.  I must apply the provisions of the welfare checklist at section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act.  

 
If I were to conclude that a placement order accords with D's welfare, I would then have to decide whether her welfare required me to dispense with the consent of her mother to the making of such an order.  I have been referred to the decision in Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] 2 FLR 625 and I am aware that the word "requires" has the connotation of the imperative: that is what is demanded rather than what is merely optional, reasonable or desirable.

 
It is now the Local Authority's case that, if granted a placement order, they would pursue a time limited search for a prospective adoptive family for D.  If the search is unsuccessful, they would hope to maintain D's current foster placement.  If in turn that proved impossible, they would search for an alternative foster family.  In the light of the recent authorities, I have reflected on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re P above and, in particular, the judgment of Lord Justice Wall, as he then was.  None of the recent authorities refer directly to circumstances where a child cannot return home but where a dual track plan is contemplated and where adoption is the preferred but not the only alternative for the Local Authority.  It may be arguable that in some such circumstances there is something apart from adoption which "will do".  However, the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal both had ample opportunity in the cases to which I have referred to cast doubt on the approach in Re P and they chose not to do so.  In the circumstances, the decision remains binding upon this court alongside the more recent decisions.

 
IV	MY FINDINGS
I am entirely satisfied and, indeed, this is not disputed that both Mr K and Miss�L have considered D's predicament with anxious care.  They were both honest and impressive witnesses who have analysed the competing alternatives for D exhaustively.  I must attach particular weight to the advice of the guardian since it was she who was so reluctant in October 2013 to endorse a plan for adoption when, as she perceived it, there was another viable alternative available. It was the guardian who argued in clear terms the potential advantages of a special guardianship order in favour of the current carers over a placement order.  

 
The balancing exercise which I must conduct today is a different exercise to that which faced me in October.  Then I was seeking to balance the likelihood of a special guardianship order to Mr�and Mrs�M against the granting of a placement order.  Today I must balance the prospect of D remaining in long term foster care throughout her minority against the granting of a placement order.  Nevertheless, many of the factors in the balancing exercise which I sought to conduct in October 2013 remain relevant and I propose to reiterate them with some amendments and additions.

 
D is about to start infant school.  Her place is on hold pending this decision.  She is already "old" in terms of finding an adoptive family.  The history of severe mental illness in the mother and the maternal grandfather will reduce the number of adoptive placements available to her, as will her mixed heritage.  

 
The evidence of the family placement team is that there are only six families who are a potential match for D.  So identifying an appropriate adoptive family may prove difficult and the Local Authority accepts that the process could take up to twelve months.  Their proposal is that they will review the position after six months, at which stage they will begin a dual search for adopters and long-term foster carers.  

 
I would find it very difficult to endorse a plan which anticipated a child of D's age being in long-term foster care for the remainder of her minority.  Long-term foster care would involve the Local Authority continuing as D's corporate parent for the next 14 years, with all of the intrusions of monitoring and intervention that implies: an allocated social worker who will inevitably change over the years, statutory reviews, a personal education plan, CRB checking, etcetera.  

 
Foster care has an inherent sense of the temporary.  A placement can easily be terminated by a foster carer giving notice either because her personal circumstances have changed or because of a change of policy or direction within the Local Authority.  Sitting in this jurisdiction, sadly, one sees far too many teenagers and adolescents who have been subject to multiple moves and instability within the care system.  

 
Moreover, if a child is in foster care the Local Authority's plans can always be challenged.  Both the mother and the grandmother made it very clear that they would view any decision for long-term fostering as a stop gap, pending the mother's health improving or the grandmother demonstrating that she can remain sober and otherwise address her problems.  That approach carries real risk of instability for D in the years ahead.  

 
Foster care ceases when a child reaches 18 and she becomes subject to the Local Authority leaving care provision.  Even at its best, foster care does not provide the lifelong commitment of adoption.  

 
On the other hand I am acutely aware that adoption is no panacea and adopters face all the vicissitudes of life faced by ordinary parents with the added complication that they are caring for a child who is not their birth child.  Adoptions can and do break down sometimes, with disastrous consequences.  

 
The Local Authority contends that D deserves the opportunity of adopters who can offer her a real family life, parents who will claim her, commit to her beyond her 18th birthday and where her needs will be met consistently in a stable environment.  

 
The Local Authority accepts that if it is successful in finding adopters D would have to move yet again.  This is an important factor in the Guardian's analysis.  She said: 

 
"I would be very concerned about yet another move for D.  If the Local Authority is seeking adoptive care for six to twelve months, that is another six to twelve months of D not knowing where she is going to be living.  The process of starting to talk about her new family is itself very unsettling".  
I accept that as the months go by and D settles with her current carers, growing up, and becoming more aware of her circumstances, moving her on to adopters will become more difficult and painful.
�������
14	 This is a little girl who knows the significance of family members and has strong bonds of affection with them.  Contact is generally a positive experience for her.  Her grandmother and mother attend conscientiously, sometimes accompanied by other members of the family.  There are of course risks in continuing direct contact arrangements when the family do not truly accept the placement as long term.  However, I am sufficiently encouraged by the behaviour of the mother and grandmother when D was removed to hope that they are able to put her needs first and will refrain from doing anything which might destabilise the placement.  Although, again, it is early days, their conduct has done much to create a positive impression of the birth family for the foster carers, who feel they could work with the family in the long term.  
Developments since October 2013: 

 
(a)	D is now some 3 months older; 
(b)	She has now started infant school where she has settled well and has friends and has the support of a counsellor; 
(c)	The evidence of N, the manager of the adoption team, is that there are now in Adoption 22, the local consortium, some 43 families approved to adopt a child of D's age, although none reflect her complex ethnicity.  (I note that Mr�and Mrs�M are of white British origin.)  By the time Mr�K gave evidence the number within Adoption 22 had reduced to 22.  There are eleven families who may be suitable on the national adoption register.  Despite that, in the light of the factors which I have previously identified, I remain doubtful whether a suitable placement can, indeed, be identified within the time scale of six months; 
(d)	The mother has continued to attend contact conscientiously which has continued to be positive.  The grandmother has missed a number of visits.  Both have continued supportive of the foster carers and have a good relationship with them. They accept that contact must gradually reduce to a level compatible with a long-term placement; 
(e)	The Local Authority, the guardian and the maternal family all continue to be impressed by the sensitive care which Mr�and Mrs�M have afforded D; 
(f)	Given some of D's difficult behaviours it has been suggested�
MISS	C:   (Interrupts) 
THE	JUDGE:  Miss�C, I do understand how upsetting it is for you.
MISS	C:  Yes, it is upsetting [inaudible] really, you know.
THE	JUDGE:  I am sorry.  Do you want me to break for a minute or shall I just get this over with?
MISS	C:  Get it over with.
THE	JUDGE:  Yes.  
(f)	I hesitate to use the vernacular term but it is suggested on behalf of the family that  D is now not "adoptable"?  I have expressed my reservations as to whether a suitable family can be identified but this is a different point.  Could D herself cope with the loss of contact to her maternal family?  Can she attach to new carers?  Will her behaviour be such as to destabilise any adoptive placement?  I am persuaded that with the help of her foster carers, D is developing a very basic understanding appropriate to her age of the relevant concepts and I accept the professional consensus from the Local Authority and the guardian that D would be capable of moving on and attaching to the right family.  
(g)	I have been concerned by the level of confusion and distress that D has already demonstrated.  I understand the argument that the granting of a placement order means that there is a continuing period of at least six months during which D cannot be told in clear terms what is going to happen. On the other hand, even if I were to decline to grant the placement order, there can be no certainty for D.  Whilst it is likely that if the Ms did apply to be long term foster carers that they would be approved as they seem entirely appropriate individuals, that process is some way off and in any events, D, like any other foster child could never be told in clear terms: you are staying here "for good".  It is one of the deficiencies of foster care, that there can be no such promises.  
I take all of those developments into account. However, the factor which continues to weigh most heavily in the balance against offering the Local Authority the opportunity to find an adoptive family is the relationship which D currently enjoys by way of contact with her mother and maternal family.  Prospective adopters will not generally countenance direct parental contact so I must approach this decision on the basis that direct contact will probably cease.  There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that both the mother and the grandmother love D very much indeed and the loss of contact will be for them devastating as it will be for the wider family.  From D's perspective she has a sense of herself as a part of her family.  She knows who her mother is, who her grandmother is, who her aunts, uncles and cousins are.  When assessing D's welfare throughout her life, the factor assumes a lesser significance, but it has nevertheless weighed anxiously in my reasoning.  

 
However, taking the evidence overall and bearing in mind the professional advice from both Mr�K and Miss�L, I am certainly persuaded that, on balance, and applying the welfare checklist, it does accord with D's welfare interests for the Local Authority to have the opportunity to search for an adoptive family.  I have sufficient confidence in the Local Authority to know they would not move D unless it was to provide her with a better option than her current placement.  

 
The question with which I have genuinely struggled is whether a placement order is truly necessary and proportionate in D's circumstances.  Is it really the case that "nothing else will do"?  I am conscious that this is the issue which has also troubled both Mr�K and Miss�L and was at least, in part, the reason why Miss�L, on a very fine balance, was unable to support the Local Authority's application in October 2013.  

 
It is obvious that there does remains an alternative, and a realistic alternative. I could  decline to grant the placement order with the result that D remains in foster care with the hope that she may be able to remain with the M family in the longer run.  Mr�K described that as an "acceptable" alternative.  So the difficult question for me is whether, although long term foster care does not in my judgment, accord with D's welfare, it is nevertheless the right alternative, given that it represents a less intrusive intervention in the lives of D and her maternal family?  Put in a different way, does the balancing exercicse come down so firmly in favour of granting the Local Authority's application that D's welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of the mother?

 
Ultimately, I have concluded that if I focus on D's welfare throughout her life and not just in the coming weeks and months the position really is very clear.  I note that in the authorities to which I have been referred, the courts have been concerned with the balance to be struck between a return to parental care and adoption.  Here, as I made clear in my earlier judgment, there is, sadly, no sensible possibility of D returning to the care of her mother.  D is still less than 5 years old.  She deserves the chance of a permanent, new family of her own.  

 
Mr�and Mrs�M cannot commit themselves to caring for her throughout her minority.  As Miss�L put it, the fact that they felt that adoption should be tried for D is "telling in terms of their commitment".  Her view was that they were nowhere near the stage of contemplating a special guardianship order. In my  judgment the blunt fact of them giving notice on this placement and contemplating doing so on a second occasion speaks volumes.  The security, stability and consistency of care D deserves is unlikely to be achieved by her remaining in foster care for the next 13 years of her minority.  As Mr�K put it� "there may be a better family out there; we need an opportunity to look for that family, we are doing D an injustice otherwise."  

 
I conclude that the overwhelming priority for D must be to give her the chance of a loving permanent family who can commit themselves to caring for her for the remainder of her life.  I fear for her future if she lacks carers who have that degree of commitment.  Ultimately, I have concluded that,  for this little girl in her current sad predicament now, nothing else will genuinely do. Focussing as I must  upon her welfare,  I am persuaded that the position really is so clear that the evidence requires me to dispense with the mother's consent to the granting of a Placement Order.

 
V	ORDERS 
Recording that I have so dispensed with the mother's consent, and on the basis of the Local Authority's plan to seek an adoptive family for a time limited period of six months which commences today, and on the basis that contact with the maternal family will be maintained at least until any matching meeting,  I make a placement order.

 
I reserve any further applications in relation to D to myself. 

 
I will direct a transcript of this judgment.at the joint expense of all of the parties.  I will circulate an anonymised draft judgment to all of the advocates so that you can all check it to make sure there are no errors that might enable anybody to identify D or her family 

 
Miss�B and Miss�C, I am very sorry to have had to reach that decision.  
VI	POSTSCRIPT 
Before I depart from the case, I do wish to emphasise clearly that this judgment should not be read as in any way critical of Mr�and Mrs�M.  They have done a very good job of caring for D since September in very difficult circumstances.  They have been honest, indeed painfully honest at times and entirely co-operative with professionals.  I   respect them for not simply "going along with" what they must have known was what professionals wanted of them. They have tried to to focus upon D and what was best for her. I am grateful to them for everything they have done on D's behalf.

I	INTRODUCTION

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with 2 brothers, A born, on 24th�May 2012, and B, born on 10th�September 2013.  

 
The parents of the children are C and D. I hope they will forgive me if I refer to them as "the mother" and "the father" by way of shorthand.  

 
The Local Authority's key social worker is Q and the children are represented by their guardian R.

 
This is the Local Authority's application for a care order in relation to A, issued on 2nd�August 2013, and for B, immediately following his birth on 17th�September 2013.  The Local Authority's plan for A and B is that they be placed for adoption and, hence, there are placement order applications issued on 6th�January 2014.

 
Each of the parents opposes the Local Authority's applications and puts themselves forward as a prospective carer for the children.  The children's guardian did support the Local Authority's applications, although, in the light of the way the case has developed, she now reserves her position.

 
The father has suffered from profound deafness since early childhood and has very limited speech.  He relies on BSL signing.  The mother seems to have had normal hearing for the first four years of her life but only partial residual hearing since then.  She speaks well, can lip-read to a limited extent and has some BSL signing skills.  Both parents have been assisted during these proceedings by hearing interpreters and relay interpreters.  I am extremely grateful for what, so far as I can judge, has been the extremely high standard of that process.  For the record, the children do not have any hearing impairment.

 
Over some four days last week, albeit interrupted, I heard oral evidence from Dr Sally Austen, Q, the mother and the father.  The guardian indicated that she would prefer not to give oral evidence at this hearing and, in the unusual circumstances which have arisen, no party insisted upon her doing so.  She has otherwise taken a full part in these proceedings and has made submissions through her solicitor, Mrs D.  Where witnesses have not given oral evidence and have not been challenged, I have taken their written evidence as read.

 
II	THE AGREED BACKGROUND
Some of what follows is taken from the Local Authority's assessment, the conclusions of which are challenged and which I have concluded that I must set aside.  I hope, however, that this summary of the background is uncontentious. No doubt, the advocates will inform me if there is a challenge to any aspect of it. 

 
The father was born on 14th�December 1976 and is now 37 years of age.  His upbringing was troubled.  His father was a violent man who drank to excess.  He was sent to a boarding school for deaf children aged 12, an establishment which seems to have been somewhat unsympathetic and where he was not happy.  When he left school, he secured employment, initially with a supermarket as a packer, and he subsequently maintained a number of employments, but has not worked for the last six years.

 
The father was previously in a relationship with E for some eight years and they have two children, F, aged 10, and G, aged 13.  For a time after the marriage broke down, the father did exercise contact to both children but they now apparently refuse to see him.  Thereafter, he was involved in a relationship with a lady called H before meeting the mother.

 
The mother was born on 3rd�June 1987 and is now 26.  She attended mainstream schools with some specialist input for her hearing impairment.  Her parents separated when she was about 16, following a long period of arguments and excessive drinking.  Thereafter, the mother remained living with her own mother and she has worked from time to time in public houses.

 
The relationship with the father was the mother's first serious relationship.  The parents met via Organisation B, began living together in about 2010 and married in 2011.

 
The Local Authority first became aware of the family in August 2012.  There had been an incident in which the mother was assaulted by the father and sustained injury, albeit, it seems, accidentally.  A rather superficial initial assessment revealed the presence of one J who was caring for A whilst, it was said, the parents resolved their difficulties with the abuse of alcohol.  Sadly, the case was then closed.

 
In January 2013, an anonymous referral was received by the Local Authority, subsequently supported by information from A's health visitor, to the effect that A was actually being cared for by J and that this had been the position for some months.  It was also said that both parents were continuing to drink alcohol to excess.  Local Authority involvement in one guise or another has been continuous since that date.

 
On 21st�April 2013, A was admitted to hospital with a scalding injury to his arm.  It subsequently became apparent that, contrary to the written agreement with the Local Authority, A was once again being cared for by J whilst the parents were drinking.  Throughout this period, the levels of concern for A were such that there were repeated out-of-hours visits to check on his welfare and whereabouts.

 
Proceedings were eventually issued in relation to A following the usual Public Law Outline procedure on 2nd�August 2013.  Preliminary directions were given by a district judge during my absence on leave but the matter was, in due course, allocated to me and was listed before me for a contested interim hearing on 28th�August 2013.  In the event, the parents did not actively oppose the making of an interim care order for A and he was placed with foster carers.  

 
I directed a comprehensive social work assessment of the parents who were presenting as a couple.  As the assessment neared its conclusion at the end of November 2013, an incident took place between the parents.  After this incident, the father moved to Area A to live with his mother and the mother remained in the former matrimonial home.  They have not resumed their relationship.

 
I also directed various assessments of family members as potential carers for A.  Sadly, those assessments were not completed within the timescale I directed and the issues resolution hearing which I had listed for 4th�December had to be adjourned until January 2014.  Far more unfortunately, all of those assessments of family members proved negative.

 
Meanwhile, the mother gave birth to B on 10th�September 2013.  He was accommodated with A's foster carers.  Care proceedings in relation to him were issued and consolidated with A's case.  

 
As I have indicated, and following the usual careful processes for consultation and approval within the Local Authority, the placement order applications were issued shortly before the adjourned hearing.  As the applications were clearly opposed, they were listed for final hearing on 30th�January 2014.  However, by that date, I had become aware of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re C (A Child) delivered on 21st�January 2014.  I have not yet seen an authoritative transcript of a full judgment but the court gave guidance as to the correct approach to care proceedings in which one or both parents suffered from profound deafness.  I read from the version of the judgment that I have available to me:

 
"First, it was necessary for all the agencies concerned to understand that communicating with a profoundly deaf person was not simply a matter of interpretation or translation.  There was a need for expert insight and support by a suitably qualified person at the earliest stage.  It was the duty of those acting for the parents to identify the disabilities as a factor at that early stage.  Secondly, the parents and Local Authority should make the court aware of the disabilities and need for special measures as a matter of case management.  Thirdly, an expert should be appointed so that the impact of the disability could be addressed at a case management hearing.  In the case of a profoundly deaf person, consideration should be given to the use of a deaf relay interpreter as an intermediary to communicate with the Local Authority and the court and, fourthly, the issue of funding had to be considered.  These issues are not merely a matter of good practice.  The court, the Local Authority and CAFCASS have a duty under the Equality Act 2010 to afford the right level of support."
In the light of that guidance, I invited the parties to identify an appropriately qualified expert to advise.  Dr Austen, a specialist clinical psychologist for deaf people, was appointed and I am grateful to her for reporting so expeditiously.  

 
On the face of things, Q's comprehensive assessment of the parents was thorough and careful.  However, it emerged at a late stage in this hearing that the BSL interpreter used by the Local Authority was insufficiently qualified and had no previous experience of interpreting for a profoundly deaf parent during such a crucial assessment.  The father now says that he found it difficult to understand the interpreter's signing.  The mother accepts that she understood the assessment process and makes no complaint about it, although she does not accept the conclusions.  It is not the fault of the Local Authority that this unhappy situation has arisen.  Q is as dismayed and shocked as everyone else by the discovery of the interpreter's lack of appropriate qualification.  The Local Authority went to an apparently reputable agency and, ironically, Q went to some trouble to ensure that the same interpreter was used throughout.  However, all parties, including, very properly, the Local Authority, now concede that the court could not place safe reliance upon Q's social work assessment.  I am satisfied that were I to attempt to do so, that would infringe the Article 6 rights of the father and possibly also of the mother.

 
In those circumstances, these proceedings must be adjourned.  That is desperately unfortunate, given the ages of these children and the urgent need to make decisions as to their future.  However, by the time that information as to the interpreter emerged, I had already heard a good deal of evidence and, in an attempt to salvage what we can from this hearing, I propose to make such findings as I can on the evidence that I have heard and as to the concessions made by the parents in an endeavour to provide a secure factual foundation for the assessment which must follow.  For the avoidance of doubt, I have sought to put Q's social work assessment from my mind in conducting this exercise.

 
Both boys have flourished in foster care and appear happy and settled.  A is observed by Q to be "a different child since he entered foster care and he is brighter, confident in exploring and more attached to his primary care giver."  The mother currently sees the children twice each week and the father once.  They have generally attended conscientiously.

 
II	MY ASSESSMENT OF THE WITNESSES
Dr Austen is, clearly, highly skilled and respected in her field.  Her written and oral evidence provided some helpful insights into the difficulties inherent in any assessment of a profoundly deaf person. However, I have to conclude that she found it difficult to put aside her own genuine and strongly held views as to the level of discrimination and unfairness inflicted upon deaf people by society, so as to achieve the appropriate standards of objectivity and neutrality expected by the Family Court of an expert witness as opposed to an advocate.  By way of obvious example, in referring to the parenting assessment conducted by O, she accepted freely that she was not critical of the methodology of that assessment, a methodology identical to that of other assessments of which she was critical, because the "result" had been favourable to the parents.  Her evidence was entirely honest, sometimes painfully so, but I am afraid that I found her far too willing to accuse, inaccurately in my judgment, other professionals of actual or potential bias and prejudice against deaf people without any substantive  evidence or meaningful enquiry.  In all of those circumstances, her evidence was not as helpful as it might otherwise have been.

 
Q was a careful and moderate witness, willing to make concessions where appropriate.  I found her very sensitive to the predicament of the parents, whilst maintaining a clear focus upon the welfare of the children.  I accept that her evidence was honest and reliable but, for the reasons I have explained, I must disregard the conclusions of her assessment work.

 
Turning to the mother, in fairness, I must express my assessment as provisional.  I am conscious of just how stressful and challenging it is to give evidence in court, let alone to be required to do so with the disadvantages that the mother's communication difficulties place in her way.  The level of her understanding, intellectually and emotionally, is something that will need to be further assessed. However, I found her to present as quite flat and unemotional even when discussing very distressing topics.  There was none of the inappropriate light-heartedness described by others, including Dr Austen.  I was impressed by the frankness of her concessions as to the inadequacy of A's care.  On the other hand, I had no clear sense of her understanding on an emotional level the impact of her and the father's behaviours upon their son.  Given the history of admitted deceit, I must be cautious about her evidence.  Having said that, on the whole, I think she was striving to tell me the truth with the exception that she has not, I think, yet been able to be entirely frank about the level of her former drinking.  

 
Given the father's communication difficulties, I recognise the problems inherent in my attempting to assess the reliability of his evidence.  It would be unwise and potentially unfair for me to draw any far-reaching conclusions at this stage.  He too made disarming concessions as to his behaviour when A was at home but, again, I fear that he appeared to lack insight into what the events might have meant for A.  Again, these are issues that must be further assessed.

 
III	THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
I remind myself that the burden lies on the Local Authority to prove the allegations which it makes.  The appropriate standard of proof is the civil standard of the simple balance of probabilities.  I have read Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35 and, particularly, the speech of Baroness Hale.  

 
It is conceded that the threshold criteria at section 31 of the Children Act are established in relation to each of the children.  I will go on in due course to make findings as to the factual basis underlying those concessions.

 
Pending the further assessment of the parents, I cannot address the options for the future of A and B.  However, in agreeing to adjourn the proceedings, I have, of course, had in mind the paramountcy of the welfare of the children, the "no delay" principle at section 1(2) of the Children Act and, in terms of the Local Authority's applications for placement orders, the principles set out by the Supreme Court in Re B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33 and the decisions of the Court of Appeal which followed.

 
Finally, in terms of the legal framework, I have reminded myself of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Re W [2013] EWCA 1227 which confirms that, in assessing and balancing different alternatives for a child's future, the court is entitled to require the Local Authority to provide such support services as are reasonably necessary, for example to enable a child to return to the care of his parents.

 

IV	MY FINDINGS
The threshold criteria
In relation to A, I am satisfied that, at the time when the Local Authority initiated proceedings, A was suffering significant harm and was likely to suffer significant harm, such harm being attributable to the care given to him or likely to be given to him by his parents  if an order were not made.  As to the factual basis underlying that finding:

 
a.	It is conceded that throughout the period following A's birth, both parents used alcohol excessively, to the extent that it affected their day-to-day care of A and their ability to make appropriate decisions in respect of his care and their capacity to protect him.
b.	In terms of impaired decision-making, in particular, the parents permitted a lady called J to care for A for protracted periods from very shortly after his birth.  J and her husband were unable to have children of their own.  J took advantage of the parents, attending at A's birth and, I am satisfied, in reality, trying to secure A's long term care for herself.  The parents were, at best, unable to prevent J's machinations and, at worst, happy to have someone they could leave A with whilst they went drinking in the local pub.  Even so, A himself spent far too much time in Pub A.  
c.	The parents' reliance on J to care for A only came to an end as a result of the referral to the Local Authority and the Local Authority's insistence that she be excluded from A's care and that the parents assume a proper degree of responsibility for their son's day-to-day care.
d.	Unfortunately, the parents also left A to be cared for by another unsuitable person.  That is K, the 22-year-old brother of the mother.  Until Saturday, 20th�April 2013, he had never previously cared for A.  In his care, A, now still only 11 months of age, sustained a scald to his left upper arm and shoulder.  I am still not at all clear as to how that scald could have occurred.  The Local Authority has not chosen to pursue any suggestion that it may have been non-accidental.  The uncle did not inform the parents of what happened immediately, waiting until the mother called home at around 7.30.  Following that call, the parents did not return straightaway but did so at about 9pm.  Neither parent saw fit to take A to hospital that night.  It is clear from their evidence that one of the factors which weighed in that decision is that they had both been drinking and feared the response of professionals.  The mother belatedly took A to hospital on the following morning.  By that stage, his arm was blistering and he was detained for treatment for some three days.
e.	Following that incident, there was a further written agreement dated 24th�April 2013 emphasising that A was not to be left in the care of any unassessed person, including J, that the parent must abstain from alcohol and that A must not be taken to the pub.  Both parents acknowledge that they understood the terms of that agreement.
f.	On the very next day, social workers discovered that A was once again in the care of J, traced the parents to the pub and found them both intoxicated.  Indeed, they were sufficiently incapacitated for the social worker to be obliged to permit J to care for A overnight.  The risks inherent in that course were emphasised when, later that night, A was found in bed with L, a man with an extensive criminal record, who had that very night been consuming alcohol.
g.	The parents' relationship has been marred by incidents of domestic abuse.  The mother has only sustained injury on two occasions, in August 2012 and on 30th�November.  However, those two incidents are merely the most distressing manifestations of the father's aggression and anger as described by the mother in evidence.
h.	The parents failed to engage with professionals or to act upon their advice so as to reduce the risks posed to A.  Indeed, they were repeatedly dishonest about their alcohol use, their whereabouts and A's whereabouts.  I have already referred to one breach of the written agreement but also, for example, on 24th�July 2013, the parents should have been at a meeting with social workers.  The mother was telephoned and said that she was at Place B with A.  Searches by the social worker and interpreter found both parents in Pub A with A, drinking lager, all contrary to the contract of expectations.
The implications for A were considerable.  He was repeatedly separated from those who should have been his primary attachment figures, his parents.  The level of care afforded by L and J was not acceptable.  His day-to-day life lacked stability.  The probable impact of domestic abuse between parents upon a child of A's age, living within the same household, is well established and, sadly, he also sustained significant physical injury in April 2013.

 
It is always easy to be wise in hindsight and I do not wish to be critical of social workers "on the ground" who were repeatedly faced with the challenging task of making difficult, finely balanced, decisions about A's safety and welfare during the spring and summer of 2013.  I must, however, record my surprise that, against the background of events prior to 20th�April 2013, A was permitted to return home to his parents' care, despite having sustained injury at the hands of another unsuitable carer, and that the correct judgment of the key social worker in April 2013 that proceedings should be issued was overruled by senior management.  I would like to see evidence in due course from the Local Authority as to why that occurred.

 
It is in that context that the Local Authority instigated the series of visits by the emergency duty team to perform welfare checks on A. They visited on over 40 occasions at various times of the day and evening.  Dr Austen is very critical that such visits took place without the benefit of BSL signers.  Aside from the sheer impracticality of having a suitably qualified interpreter on hand for all of those very many visits, none of which will have lasted more than a few minutes, I fear that Dr Austen misunderstood the purpose and nature of those visits.  The social workers were not there to assess the parents or to offer parenting advice but simply to check that A was present and that he was safe.  Where welfare issues were raised, for example the dog urinating on the floor where A was playing and the mess not being cleared up, or the father appearing drunk, the issue was reported back to the key social worker who addressed it with the parents with the assistance of a BSL interpreter, albeit it now seems that she was not well qualified.

 
Turning to B, the agreed threshold criteria refers to him suffering significant harm at the time when the Local Authority instituted proceedings.  That cannot be correct.  Although it is a dismaying and unchallenged fact that the mother continued to consume alcohol to excess throughout her pregnancy, that cannot found a finding under section 31 of actual harm.  I am, however, entirely satisfied that, at the time of B's birth, he was likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the care likely to be provided to him on the basis that such care was, in all probability, to be similar to that provided to A, which undoubtedly caused A to sustain the significant harm I have described.

 
It is perhaps convenient if I address at this stage another element of the history, the process of section 20 accommodation which Dr Austen also found objectionable.  As a matter of law, only one parent needs to agree that their child be accommodated under section 20.  Miss B on the mother's behalf does not seek to argue that the mother did not understand what was being asked of her.  I accept that the father was very reluctant to agree, as are many parents in this predicament.  Eventually, he did so.  In any event, B was only accommodated for some 24 hours before the Local Authority issued care proceedings.  Accordingly, I do not consider that this issue needs further enquiry.

 
Additional findings
I now need to turn from the threshold issues which relate only to the facts at the time of the Local Authority's intervention, to more recent and general matters.  

 
I begin with the incident which took place on 30th�November 2013.  Q was particularly anxious about this incident, pointing out that it occurred at a really important time when both parents were planning to make a fresh start in a new home with a garden away from their drinking associates and unfortunate networks.  Both parents, having assured the court that they were totally abstinent, were, in fact, once again, drinking to excess this time with M and N, not appropriate individuals for them to be associating with.  There may have been some modest level of provocation but, certainly, it is clear that the father struck the mother, pushed her around and caused her injury.  In his statement dated 17th�December 2013, the father said that the incident had been "blown out of all proportion" and amounted to no more than "play fighting".  That was untrue.  On 14th�February 2014, he pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  He is now the subject of a restraining order for a period of two years to provide protection for the mother and he has been fined.

 
In terms of contact, the father's contact is observed as very good.  He is described as "shining" when he is in the presence of his children.  He has also attended conscientiously.

 
The father's mental and psychological health has been and remains a source of considerable anxiety.  It seems likely to me that his misuse of alcohol is but a symptom, a reflection of underlying dysfunction.  It is apparent that his problems are longstanding.  His excessive alcohol consumption and his inability to control his temper have been features of his two previous relationships.  The bundle contains records of police involvement at a series of unhappy incidents going back to 2006.  Specific incidents have not been put to the father and, hence, I make no specific findings.  These are also matters for further assessment.

 
I am not a psychologist or a psychiatrist but it seems a reasonable hypothesis that the father's level of frustration and aggression is linked with his communication difficulties and a sense of hopelessness.  Indeed, in July 2013 and later in September 2013, he seriously considered suicide.

 
I am, frankly, sceptical that the course of counselling which the father proposes is likely to address effectively issues of such gravity and complexity but it does seem  that hitherto the father has received very little appropriate treatment and support from the health services.  He points out that, as a profoundly deaf person, he finds it difficult to go to his general practitioner.  He really needs to make urgent efforts to access appropriate treatment.

 
I accept, provisionally, that the father has managed to control his drinking since he moved to live with his mother in area A.  Q was struck by how physically, he looks "so much better". 

 
Turning to the mother, I fear that the mother also has significant underlying issues associated with a lack of self-esteem and confidence.  I also suspect that she has not fully recovered from the tragic loss of her mother and uncle during 2012. I accept provisionally that her alcohol consumption is under control. These are matters for further assessment.

 
The observations of the mother in contact are to the effect that she can attend to the basic needs of the children and, in practical terms, is able to feed and change and generally care for them. She attends conscientiously.  Sadly, repeated observations revealed a dearth of interaction and stimulation for the children.  More recently, the mother appears to have been advised and encouraged to be more sociable and interactive with both children and the situation appears to be improving. The mother herself described, in moving terms, a recent contact session which had taken place within the community where she clearly felt more relaxed and natural than had been the case in the contact to date.

 
I have heard a good deal of evidence as to what seems to be the very considerable level of support services which were provided to assist the parents in their care of A and to ameliorate their drinking problems.  Dr Austen is critical of some of those services.  I have concluded that, at this stage, it would not be desirable for me to make findings or even to investigate whether the parents have, indeed, been provided not just with services, but services which met their needs.

 
V	THE WAY FORWARD
There have been various discussions about the proposed further assessment.  I note, and it is a tribute to Q's professional skills and to the mother's honesty, that despite the conclusions of Q's assessment, the mother would have preferred her as the assessor for the future.  Sadly, Q is due to leave the Authority in the coming weeks and it would not be possible to ensure continuity if she were to undertake the work.

 
The guardian and the Local Authority are strongly opposed to Dr Austen having any continuing role in this case.  That is an unfortunate situation, not least because it means that the parents will have to be introduced to yet another professional but I accept those submissions.

 
What I have in mind is not a generic assessment of these parents' functioning, as it were, "in the abstract".  The primary question which I will ultimately have to determine is whether either of the parents could, with appropriate support, provide an acceptable level of care for A and B.  It will be apparent from this judgment that I find that A's care was wholly unacceptable and that it was likely to have been so throughout his upbringing by his parents.  B's care was also likely to be unacceptable if he had been placed in their care.  That, sadly, is the direct responsibility of both parents.

 
So, the issues which must be considered in the assessment are these. 

 
(i)  What, if anything, has changed within the functioning of either parent since the children were removed?
(ii)  Are those changes sufficient to reduce the risk factors to a tolerable level?
(iii)  What still needs to change within the parents' functioning to enable them to provide acceptable care for these two children?
(iv)  What is the parents' capacity for sustaining change in their parenting skills?
(v)  What is the timescale for such necessary changes?
I will hear further argument as to any additional areas of investigation in due course:
The assessment needs to address and balance the relevant factors as to parenting capacity with, so far as it is possible and so far as within the remit of the assessor, the other factors in the welfare checklist, including, particularly, the pressing needs of these very young children.

 
During this hearing, the father has been greatly assisted by relay interpreters.  The relay interpreter is him or herself a deaf person with advanced signing skills and a sensitive grasp of non-verbal communication.  It was explained to me that their role is to ensure that the deaf parent has accurately understood the signing of the hearing interpreter, simplifying, modifying and adapting concepts as necessary.  Dr Austen advised that the father's signing skills were fluent and that he did not require relay interpreters so, at the start of this case, I did query their continuing involvement.  The father indicated that he preferred them to stay and, in the event, my own unskilled observations have indicated that he has placed heavy reliance upon the relay interpreters who have proved invaluable.  I hope that it will be possible for relay interpreters to be provided to assist the father in any planned assessment.  

 
Finally, in the light of the decision in Re W to which I have referred, the assessment must analyse what support services might be necessary or desirable to support any proposed placement.

	This is the final hearing of an application in respect of CB, a little boy aged 3 by WSCC for a Care Order issued on 16 August 2013 and a Placement Order issued on 9 January 2014.  The allocated social worker is AM.  The local authority is represented by Ms Fenn.  

 



	CB is a child of dual heritage. His mother is M who is represented by the Official Solicitor who acts as her litigation friend and has instructed Wannops LLP to act for her.  She has been represented by her advocate, Ms Ellis, at this hearing.  M has not attended the hearing although I am satisfied that she is aware of it. M is a Chinese citizen resident in the UK and is aged 34 years.  Her primary language is Cantonese but I am told by the father and it is clear from the records that she also speaks English to a good standard.  In any event, she has had the benefit of an interpreter when necessary.  

 



	His father is F who has attended court and is represented by counsel, Mr Bergin.  F is a white British man aged 56 years.  

 



	The mother and father live together at the father's studio accommodation in Newhaven in breach of his tenancy.  I am told by the father they are not in a relationship despite living at the same address since September 2013.  

 



	CB is represented by his Children's Guardian, Mr Julian Shinn, and his solicitor, Ms Imogen Bell and counsel, Mr Ager.

 



	CB was removed from his mother's care on 19 July 2013 by the police and placed in foster care.  This was initially by way of a section 20 agreement and subsequently pursuant to interim care orders from 20 September 2013.

 



	The local authority seek care and placement orders in support of their care plan for adoption outside of the birth family.  The care plan is supported by Mr Shinn.

 



	The Official Solicitor, on behalf of the mother does not oppose a finding that the threshold criteria are met or an order being made.  His statement dated 10 January 2014 predated sight of the application for a placement order but it has been confirmed by Ms Ellis that he does not oppose the application.

 



	The father opposes the care plan.  He seeks CB's immediate return to his care or after a parenting assessment although he does not accept that this is necessary.  

 



	I have read the court bundles and heard from JH, Social Worker, AM, Senior Social Worker, F and the Guardian.  I am grateful to the advocates for their assistance throughout the hearing and their closing submissions.  At the conclusion of the hearing on 13 February 2014, I reserved judgment, which I hand down in draft format and have listed a short hearing on 28 February 2014 to deal with any amendments to the judgment and approve the final order. 

 



	The final threshold document is not opposed by either parent.  In essence, it alleges neglect of CB's emotional needs as a consequence of the mother's conduct and by implication a failure to protect by the father.  In addition, there are cross allegations of domestic violence.  I am satisfied that the threshold is established by virtue of the matters set out in the document and that there was a failure to protect CB's welfare by both parents.  I appreciate that the father has difficulties with his responsibility for events but in my judgment I find that he did not protect CB from emotional harm and has no genuine insight into his behaviour and the impact of his inability to focus on and prioritise CB's needs.    

 



Background



	There is limited information available as to the background.  The mother has not engaged at all with the proceedings and her medical records have not been disclosed.  In relation to the father, he refused the offer of an assessment in September 2013 but did agree to participate in a viability assessment January 2014.  In addition, the local authority prepared an Initial Assessment in 2011 and two Core Assessments in 2012.  The father's medical records have been disclosed.  These documents are the main source of information in respect of the history.

 



	 M was seen by Dr Royston, the court appointed Consultant Psychiatrist, on 5 September 2013.  He confirmed that the mother lacked capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and signed a certificate of capacity to that effect dated 17 September 2013. 

 



	The father is a qualified teacher but has not worked for many years due to ill health.  He was diagnosed with either Post Viral Syndrome or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in 1988 and does not appear to have worked since 2005 bar a short period of employment with Marks and Spencer during the Christmas period in 2010.  He is dependent upon benefits and currently lives in accommodation for the over 55s.  This has an occupancy restriction of one person.  M has lived with him since September and as a consequence the landlord is threatening to evict him from the property.  F told me that he felt unable to exclude M by way of injunction proceedings and has circumvented possession proceedings by giving notice to quit.  If CB is returned to him he will initially be given emergency bed and breakfast accommodation.  He is in receipt of benefits, one of which is Employment Seekers Allowance, which replaces the old disability benefit.  This benefit is time limited and will revert to Job Seekers Allowance. 

 



	The father has had some contact with his extended family.  He has a cousin who he visited with CB from time to time in 2012.  The paternal family are aware of these proceedings but are unable to offer support to the father in caring for CB and do not put themselves forward as potential carers for CB.  

 



	In brief, the parents met in February 2009 when the mother was visiting the UK to study English. They cohabited within a month of meeting one another.  It is unclear when they separated but certainly on the basis of the father's account they lived together save from December 2012 to September 2013.  

 



	Prior to CB's removal in July 2013, he was cared for primarily by his mother save when she was absent in China from September � November 2011 and January � August 2012.  During this time CB was cared for by his father with some support from the local authority and the father's cousin, AP. 

 



	The mother has two older children who live with their father in Hong Kong.  She came to the UK in 2003 with her husband who is Chinese but also, I understand, a UK citizen.  The children were born here and after their parent's separation they were taken by their father to China.  The mother is estranged from the children.  She has tried to locate them which was the purpose of her trips to China.  Some of her daughters' paternal relations live in Kent.  They have not been approached by the local authority in these proceedings. I am told that enquiries will be made if I make the orders sought by the local authority for the purposes of life story work.   There is no other information available in respect of the maternal family. 

 



	As already noted, the family have been known to the local authority since June 2011.  There have been three assessments: 

 


(i)	Initial Assessment dated 27.10.11 � 06.11.11;(ii)	Core Assessment dated 02.08.12 � 28.09.12;(iii)	Core Assessment dated 07.12.12 � 12.02.13.



	The initial assessment was triggered by a referral from the police in relation to the mother's whereabouts. This was after she had gone to Hong Kong/mainland China in 2011.  The father asked the police to confirm whether she had boarded her flight and the police attended his address.  They were concerned about the situation and made a referral to the local authority.  Whilst the mother was away, the father did not know her whereabouts and was unsure whether she would return. He told the social worker that he was worried that she had post natal depression.  He said things were difficult at home given the shortage of money and their social isolation.  There was a problem with his accommodation as it was a tenancy in the mother's sole name and as she was not occupying the property, the father was due to be evicted. 

 



	The assessment noted the father's isolation and although he was managing CB's practical care there was concern about the stress he was under in respect of their accommodation.  He was due to be evicted on 28 November 2011.   A referral was made to a family support worker to support the father but he declined further help as the mother returned on 11 November 2011 and the case was closed.  

 



	The Core Assessment in August 2012 came after a number of requests for help by the father in July 2012 after the mother had been away since January 2012.  Once again he did not know where she was or if or when she was coming back.  The local authority records indicate that the father asked for respite care for CB and said that he thought that he may be better off in foster care in order to experience family life.  The father denies the use of the word "respite" but accepted in evidence that he may have discussed alternative care arrangements for CB with the social worker.  He told me that he wanted CB to have the same advantages he had as a child, namely, a conventional family life with both parents and a stable home environment.  

 



	The father accepts that whilst the mother was away he had support from his cousin, AP.  She has filed a manuscript statement in relation to her concerns about the father.  The local authority does not seek to rely on the contents of her statement other than as confirmation that she did help the father from time to time with CB.  I have not attached any weight to the statement beyond the father's admission that AP supported him by having him and CB to stay occasionally and on two occasions of 4 � 5 days each she looked after CB to give the father a break.

 



	The core assessment did not have any concerns about the father's emotional warmth and general care of CB, the issue was housing as before and the father's ability to cope with the stresses of caring for CB on his own.  The father has a long standing diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome which affected his energy levels and despite the father taking advantage of local children's resources he found it difficult to cope.  Once again a referral was made for additional support through a family support worker, which the father declined as the mother returned in August 2012 shortly before the conclusion of the assessment.  

 



	The core assessment in December 2012 was triggered by concerns in relation to the mother's mental health.  The local authority received an anonymous call on 7 December 2012 from a caller who was obviously familiar with the family circumstances.  The caller said that the mother had told the father to leave and he had told her that the mother was hearing voices. He said that he had been contacted by a mental health nurse who was concerned that the mother was not answering the phone or engaging with the service.  The health visitor also reported a call she had received.  She said the caller was a woman who was concerned about mother's mental health.  She reported that mother was not eating or feeding CB.  The social worker made an unannounced visit on 12 December 2012 and did not find anything of concern.  The mother denied any mental health problems. A further visit was made on 18 December, which was also unremarkable.  

 



	I note an entry in the father's medical records on 7 December 2012 when he told his doctor that he thought the mother had mental health problems.  The history given by the father to his doctor was that he felt she had mental problems with strange comments for example someone is trying to read her mind and she felt that he (the father) was trying to control her and kill her. He said this had been going on for 2 weeks and she refused to take the medication she was prescribed in China. The mother had told him to leave the flat.  The father was in a hostel in Eastbourne and she had stopped his contact with CB. The doctor advised him to take charge of CB. 

 



	This entry is in stark contrast to the father's evidence in chief when he told me in terms that the mother was fine and he did not detect any signs of mental ill health until July 2013 when CB was removed by the local authority.  He said the only thing was that she was somewhat low in mood which he ascribed to the loss of her older children.  He referred to one occasion when he was using a knife to cook with that she gave him an odd look but that was it.  

 



	During cross examination, he agreed that he had told the social worker that the mother had heard voices and subsequently in answer to my questions agreed the contents of the entry in his medical records.  He also confirmed that the mother had taken some medication in China (he did not know what it was) but stopped taking it here.  He felt that the medicine had stabilised her mood.  Nevertheless, he told me that the mother's care of CB was exemplary and was unable to explain in any satisfactory manner why he told me that she did not have any mental health problems before July 2013.  Unfortunately, I am driven to conclude that this was a deliberate lie in order to minimise the mother's condition and as a consequence his failure to protect CB.  This is compounded by his failure to take active steps to ensure CB's wellbeing when the mother refused contact.  I appreciate that the local authority were reassured by the mother but they did not have the benefit of the father's concerns which he shared with his doctor but did not report to the local authority.  This is consistent with his attitude towards the mother both before and during these proceedings.  He appears unable to enforce boundaries with her ultimately at CB's expense. 

 



	The mother refused to allow the father any contact with CB until he sought the assistance of CB's nursery and the local authority in restoring contact. CB's first contact with his father since December 2012 was via the nursery in May 2013.  In his final statement, the father accepts he should have been more proactive in pursuing contact with CB.  He says that he was concerned contact would cause the mother pressure and he wanted her to support contact. 

 



	In the meantime, there were reports of concerns in respect of the mother's mental health, financial difficulties, CB's presentation at nursery in inappropriate clothing for the weather and poor diet.  He was described as watchful of his mother when she became animated about her financial difficulties.  The mother did not take CB for audiology and speech therapy appointments.  

 



	The mother was evicted from her accommodation in June 2013 as she was heavily in arrears with the rent. A police report dated 27 June 2013 noted that the mother and CB were camped outside on the balcony of her flat with an eviction notice posted on the front door. They were given emergency bed and breakfast accommodation by the local authority but had to be moved due to the mother's aggressive behaviour towards staff and other residents and her inadequate supervision of CB.  He was left to wander alone in public areas aged 2 � years.  

 



	On 17 July 2013, the mother and father arrived with CB at his nursery and met with the social worker who explained their concerns about the lack of supervision. Neither parent appeared to be able to focus on CB and there were further complaints in the evening about the mother's failure to supervise CB. 

 



	There were discussions between the social worker and the father on 16th and 18th July 2013.  The then allocated social worker said that when the father was asked whether he could care for CB, he told her that he could only do so over the weekend but not in the long term.  The father said this was not the case.  He said he would stay with family for the weekend but denied having said that he could not look after CB in the long term. The case recordings were produced during the hearing and it appears that the father and social worker had agreed that his accommodation was inadequate beyond a few days' stay.  He knew that he could approach the housing department for assistance and said he would discuss this with his solicitor.   Thereafter, the discussion appeared to focus on the mother's housing and financial needs without further reference to the father's ability to care for CB.  I have heard from the social worker and the father on the issue and it seems to me that it was clear to them both that the father was not in a position at that point to care for CB but that he would take advice and pursue housing with the local authority.   As far as I am aware, the only steps the father has taken since that time in relation to housing is to give notice on his current accommodation in order to avoid possession proceedings.   

 



	On 19 July 2013, the mother left CB strapped in his buggy in the hallway of the bed and breakfast accommodation.  The manager said CB was distressed, crying and calling out for his mother who shouted at him and told him he was going to stay there until 1.00 pm, it being 12.20 at the time.  The manager pleaded with the mother to let CB into their room but she refused. The manager used her key to go into the room but the mother was adamant that CB could not come in until 1.00 pm.  The police were called and ultimately removed CB under their powers of protection and he was placed in foster care.

 



	On 9 August 2013, the Community Mental Health Team undertook an initial assessment of the mother which showed clear psychotic symptoms.  When she was seen by Dr Royston, he considered that her condition appeared to have deteriorated since that assessment.   The mother has not engaged with the Mental Health Team and has not made contact with her solicitors since 14 October 2013.  

 





	CB has been assessed by Dr Shute, Consultant Paediatrician. In October 2013, the conclusion was that CB presented with a disordered social communication profile which required further evaluation.  In December 2013, some improvement was observed in his speech and language although it was considered that he could meet the criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder.  Dr Shute did not consider it appropriate to confirm the diagnosis given his early history and the impact this may have had on his development.  He moved to another foster placement in January.  He is the only child in this placement and has made good progress to the extent that the social worker and his Guardian believe that he will be able to make positive attachments if he moves to another permanent placement pursuant to the care plan.  

 



	Contact was arranged for both parents.  The Children's Guardian was anxious at the outset that the father should have a high level of contact with CB up to 5 times per week.  Bizarrely, the father did not agree with that level of contact and wanted it on a fortnightly basis.  He said that he was told by a friend who was a retired head teacher that less frequent contact would be better for CB.  He said it would be less confusing for him to see his father fortnightly rather than for him to come in and out of his life on a very regular basis.  The father maintained this view despite being advised by the professionals that CB would benefit from frequent contact to support their relationship.  He stopped attending contact after 6 September 2013 despite the local authority funding his travel arrangements and an agreed schedule of contact drawn up in the order dated 20 September 2013.  The father refused to attend 1:1 supervised contact organised at the contact centre.  He wanted contact to take place at a venue with other children, such as a church run family centre. He told me this would allow him to observe CB and his development whilst also being able to spend time with him.  The local authority refused the father's request and the Guardian was equally opposed to the father's plan.  In evidence, the social worker and the Guardian explained that they thought that a contact at a centre with other children present along with the father would be extremely confusing for CB particularly given the upheaval CB had already experienced.  I agree. 

 



	The next contact was on 20 December 2013 although CB saw his parents briefly at his medical appointment on 14 October 2013.  The local authority again sought to persuade the father to take up contact after the session on 20 December but although he initially appeared to be willing to do so, he emailed the social worker in January cancelling all contact until this hearing.  He thought it was unfair to CB to start contact again if he ultimately did not return to his care.   

 



	It is extremely sad that the father was unable to commit to the contact arrangements despite his objections.  I note that there were positive observations of his interaction with CB, which are consistent with earlier recordings during the assessments in 2011 and 2012.  I have no doubt that it would have been to CB's benefit to have had regular contact with his father. 

 



	Unfortunately, the mother's contact was equally unreliable.  She did not attend from 3 September 2013 and although she did attend on 20 December she became distressed and aggressive to the social worker towards the end of the contact.  This was shortly after the father had asked the social worker about a meeting and then left the contact centre without saying goodbye to CB.  The mother's behaviour was such that the social worker called the security guard.   CB did not react to events at the time but was distressed on his way home with the foster carer, repeatedly saying, "mummy crying', "mummy shouting", "mummy sad again".  I find that whilst the parents' obviously wanted to see CB at contact they were unable to remain focused on his needs.  The father explained his early departure as an attempt to minimise CB's distress.  I find this explanation to be misguided and not child focused.  

 



	The local authority wanted the father to engage in an assessment of his capacity to care for CB.  This was keenly supported by the Guardian and the court.  The programme for the assessment is set out in the statement of JAH, Senior Social Worker.  She wrote to the father with the details of the assessment on 24 September 2013 but unfortunately he replied on 26 September that he would not be at home for her visit or "available at present to undertake the course you propose." [B88]  He has told me that he was unwell at the time but has not filed any evidence in support of this assertion.  He told me that he had a great deal to do with solicitors' appointments and his housing situation but nothing directly related to a specific health problem outside of the diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, which he has been anxious to assure me that this has been of limited significance over the last few years.

 



	Ultimately, he did agree to a viability assessment in January, which consisted of an interview with the social worker at his home address.  The interview took place in the community lobby of the property as the mother was still in bed in his flat.  I asked him why he did not ask the mother to leave to allow them some privacy for the interview.  He was unable to provide a satisfactory answer other than to say that he thought the community area was preferable in any event. 

 



	The assessment balanced the positive and negative features of the father's care of CB.  It recognised his ability to show CB warm and loving care and that he had a theoretical understanding of a child's basic needs. Nevertheless, he was unable to appreciate the impact upon CB of the failure to attend contact, the mother's abrupt and lengthy absences and her declining mental health.  The father stated that he wanted the mother to be fully involved in CB's life and did not accept that he needed to impose boundaries as evidenced by his failure to ensure that she left his property leaving him free to concentrate on these proceedings and ensure that he was able to care for CB.  The father was unable to accept advice from the local authority, for example, in relation to contact and there was no evidence from the assessment that he was prepared to change his approach.  In conclusion, the assessment was unable to recommend the father as a carer for CB or a further assessment of him.    

 





The Law



	Care proceedings involve two principal questions. First, are the threshold criteria for making a care order under section 31 of the Children Act 1989 satisfied? Secondly, if so, what order should the court make?

 



	Section 31 (2) provides:

 

"A court may only make a care order or supervision order if it is satisfied (a) that the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm and (b) that the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to 

(i)� the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him; or(ii)� the child's being beyond parental control."

	As threshold has not been actively contested, this hearing has in reality concentrated on what, if any, order I should make. 

 



	In answering that question, I bear in mind the rights of the parents and CB under Article 8 of ECHR to respect for family and private life. Where there is a conflict between the rights of a child and a parent, the rights of the child prevail: Yousef v Netherlands [2003] 1 FLR 210.

 

	Under section 1(1) of the Children Act, CB's welfare is my paramount consideration. Under section 1(2), any delay in making decisions concerning his future is likely to prejudice his welfare. Section 1(3) provides a checklist of factors to be taken into account when determining their welfare, and what order should be made.

 

	On the application for a placement order, the court applies section 1 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. On such an application, my paramount consideration is the child's welfare throughout their life: section 1(2). Again, I take into account the fact that delay in coming to a decision is likely to prejudice CB's welfare. There is, again, a checklist of factors to be taken into account, in this case set out in section 1(4) of the 2002 Act. In this case, the local authority seeks a placement order in relation to CB.  I must have regard to the likely effect on the child (throughout his life) of having ceased to be a member of his birth family and becoming an adopted person; his background; any harm he is at risk of suffering; his relationship with his birth relatives. In addition, both section 1(3)(g) of the 1989 Act and section 1(6) of the 2002 Act require the court to have regard to the range of orders available and the court must not make an order under either Act unless it considers that it would be better for the child concerned than not doing so.

 

	Under section 21(3) of the 2002 Act, a court may not make a placement order unless satisfied either that the parent has consented to the child being placed for adoption or that his or her consent should be dispensed with.  Under section 52(1)(b), the court may dispense with the parent's consent if the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with. 

 

	These provisions have been subjected to analysis in a number of important decisions, and in particular by the Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33 and in a series of decisions in the Court of Appeal culminating in Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146. I have had those decisions firmly in mind at all points during this hearing.

 

	In Re B, the Supreme Court, having reminded itself of the European jurisprudence, reiterated that the test for severing a relationship between a parent and child is very strict so that, in the words of Baroness Hale of Richmond at paragraph 198, it should occur:

 

"only in exceptional circumstances and when motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short, when nothing else will do. In many cases and particularly where the feared harm has not yet materialised and may never do so, it will be necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions."

As Lord Neuberger observed at paragraph 77, making a child subject to a care order with a plan for adoption should be 'a last resort' where 'no other course was possible in her interests'. 

	This interpretation was reiterated by the President in his judgment in the Court of Appeal in Re B-S. The statutory language in the 2002 Act imposes a stringent test. What must be shown is that the child's welfare 'requires' parental consent to adoption to be dispensed with.   

 

	"Require" has the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, "the connotation of the imperative. What is demanded rather than what is merely optional or reasonable or desirable". Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2 FLR 625, at paragraphs 120,125.

 



My Conclusions



	Unfortunately, the mother is not in a position to care for CB.  She was clearly unable to meet CB's needs prior to his removal from her care.  Not only did she abruptly leave him for two lengthy occasions when he was very young but also failed to provide him with good enough care from December 2012 onwards.  I find that CB suffered emotional harm in her care. He was not only neglected and left unsupervised and thereby exposed to potentially serious harm but also on the basis of the mother's conduct set out above, he would have been highly distressed which would have caused him significant emotional harm.  I also find on the basis of the unchallenged evidence, that the mother had no insight into the damage that she was doing to CB.  She was unpredictable and lacked empathy for her child.  Sadly, there is no evidence that there is any change to this position.  I agree with the Official Solicitor's conclusion on behalf of the mother that there is no realistic basis for opposition to an order being made. 

 



	In relation to the father, it was clear to me from his evidence that he loves his son.  I believe that he understands that CB needs loving, nurturing care and stability from his parents but has been unable to provide him with this level of care on a consistent basis.  He has been observed to be a warm and affectionate parent but nevertheless has not been able to maintain a commitment to the relationship both before and during these proceedings.  He appears to have been able to access assistance from the local authority when the mother was away but refused to continue to work with them after her return on both occasions.  I am extremely troubled by his behaviour given what he knew about her mental health.  In my judgment, the father was well aware of the mother's mental health difficulties as he explained them to his doctor in December 2012.  I also find that he lied to me initially about the mother's mental health until he was confronted with the entry from his medical records. For his own reasons, he did not tell the local authority about his concerns about the mother's mental health.  I appreciate that he relies upon the local authority's positive observations of the mother's care of CB from December onwards.  They did not have the advantage of his knowledge of the mother's behaviour.  On my reading of the papers there were concerns about her care of CB, which would no doubt have increased if they had known about the father's concerns. 

 



	When I refer to the father's lack of commitment to CB, this is not only a reference to his failure to pursue contact from December 2012 � May 2013 but also his attitude towards the local authority and his failure to prioritise CB's safety.  As I have noted he declined an assessment of the mother on two occasions and on the latter occasion in September 2012 he was aware that she had been prescribed medication for her mental health in China. He did not tell the local authority about his concerns for the mother's mental health when the mother refused to allow contact. He has not taken any steps to organise his accommodation or to remove the mother from his accommodation beyond finally giving notice to quit shortly before the start of this hearing.  He has had barely any contact with CB despite the best efforts of the local authority and the Guardian.  He declined the assessment offered in September 2013 and only consented to a viability assessment at the last minute. 

 



	Unfortunately, the father was unable to acknowledge any real deficit in his parenting as is apparent by his position that CB return to him forthwith.  I found him to be a kind and intelligent man but completely lacking in insight in respect of his ability to meet CB's needs and the impact upon his son of the parenting that he has received from his mother and his father.  He was unable to acknowledge to me the harm done by his failure to attend contact consistently and ensure that the mother was no longer a part of his household.  I have no confidence that he would be able to resist her, if he was living with CB and she wanted to visit or stay with them.  He told me she was an exemplary mother despite his concerns in December 2012, which led his doctor to advise him to take charge of CB.  

 



	The father has not explained to my satisfaction his failure to engage in these proceedings.  On the evidence I do not accept that he was too unwell to engage with the proposed assessment in October 2013.  In any event, the explanation he gave in evidence was that he had too many appointments with his solicitors and did not have sufficient time to attend the assessment.  I do not find this to be a reasonable explanation for his failure to participate in the assessment.  The demands upon his time were no greater than for many parents who find themselves in this situation but who are able to engage with the proceedings appropriately.  Unfortunately, this is another example of his inability to focus on CB and prioritise his welfare.  

 



	I am equally unimpressed by his behaviour in relation to contact.  His explanation for failing to attend contact shifted from his complaint in relation to the venue in September/October 2013 to a refusal to attend at all from January 2014.  As I have already made plain this was without regard or understanding of CB's needs and entirely unacceptable.  On the basis of his evidence, I do not believe that the father had acquired any insight into the damaging nature of his behaviour and the impact upon his son.  Historically, he engages with professionals on his terms as demonstrated by his refusal to engage with the local authority after the mother returned from China in 2011 and in 2012.  His attitude has not shifted in these proceedings.  He is clearly unable to take advice from the professionals given the repeated concerns expressed by the local authority and the Guardian in respect of his attitude towards contact and his participation in these proceedings. 

 



	In my judgment the father is not in a position to safely care for CB and I cannot sanction a return home.

 



	The father's alternative position is for a parenting assessment.  There has not been a formal application pursuant to section 38(6) of the Children Act 1989 on his behalf.  In his final statement, he makes it clear that he does not accept that there is a need for any further assessment of him, as it his case is that he has cared for CB satisfactorily in the past.  Clearly, whilst I do not share his view of his parenting skills, I must balance the competing factors in relation to the application for an assessment and the consequent delay that would entail.

 



	The social worker and the Children's Guardian do not believe that an assessment has any realistic prospect of success.  They rely on the matters set out in my judgment and whilst they both acknowledge his ability to care for CB at times, they do not believe he has the capacity to deal with the challenges of a further assessment or, indeed, as a full time carer of CB.  They both point to the need for permanency and the fact that CB has a desperate need for decisions to be made now.  He has suffered constant upheaval throughout his life and if he is to attach to permanent carers successfully, he must have the opportunity to do so as soon as possible.  If there were an assessment of the father this is likely to delay the final decision for another 4 months at least.  

 



	The advantage for CB is the prospect of being cared for by his parent.  I do not underestimate that.  I am unable, however, to support the father's application.  I do not believe that he is committed to an assessment as is clear from his written and oral evidence.  I agree with the social worker and Guardian that the overwhelming likelihood is that the assessment will not move matters on beyond the conclusions of the current assessment.  Unfortunately, there is no sound basis for a significant delay to the final decision for CB.  I refuse the application.

 



	As set out above, CB's welfare is my paramount concern and fundamental to that is the right to be cared for by his parents, if at all possible.  The local authority seeks a placement order in pursuit of their care plan for permanency outside of the birth family.  

 



	I accept that CB's wishes and feelings would be in the first instance to be cared for by his parents, if possible.  He is not of an age to give clear expression to his views. 

 



	In respect of CB's emotional and physical needs.  He has an urgent need for security and stability.  The social worker believes he has an attachment disorder, which she hoped is resolving as a consequence of the care that he has received from his current foster carers. The Guardian echoes the social worker's concerns about his ability to attach albeit believes that CB does not have a fully developed attachment disorder given his progress with the current carers. They both advise in the clearest terms that they believe that he will attach to permanent carers and I am told that the local authority will also provide assistance through their Leapfrog programme, which provides support for children and carers in these circumstances.  CB has impaired language skills, which are being addressed but his speech continues to be described as disordered.  It is unfortunate that he missed appointments with the speech therapist when he was living with his mother.  

 



	In terms of the harm he has suffered, I have made clear findings that he has suffered significant emotional harm and that there is an ongoing risk of the same attributable to the care he would receive from both parents if an order were not made.  

 



	I have also found that neither parent is able to protect CB from harm and provide him with safe, stable and secure care.  

 



	There are no other persons available to care for CB within his extended maternal and paternal family.   AP convened a family meeting and no one was in a position to offer to care for him.  

 



	The disadvantage of a placement order is that it will sever CB's family ties on a life long basis.  It is an order when nothing else will do.  The advantages of an order are that it will provide him with a life long family with carers who have been subject to a intensive process of selection and training and are dedicated to providing a secure and loving home.  I cannot better the succinct and eloquent formulation of Pauffley J in LRP (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Placement Order) [2013] EWHC 3974 (Fam),

 



The advantages of a placement order are many and obvious. Prospective adopters are required to submit themselves to a rigorous and very thorough assessment process over many months. Those who satisfy the selection criteria are ordinarily of the highest calibre. They may be confidently expected to provide extremely good parenting to any child who is matched with them in all areas of his / her development. They will protect LRP  from harm of whatever kind. The overwhelming probability is that they will be able to provide her with the priceless gift of a happy, secure and stable childhood from which she will derive life-long advantages.



	In the circumstances, I dispense with the consent of the father and the mother (if it was necessary) pursuant to section 52(1) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 on the basis that CB's welfare demands that I should do so.

JUDGMENT
(AS APPROVED)

JUDGE PURKISS:� This is the final hearing
of an application for a care and placement order in relation to �L�, born on 5th
December 2013.� L�s mother is �SP�; L�s father is �SH�.� Both of L�s parents
have parental responsibility for him.

��������� On 5th June
2013, I made care and placement orders in relation to L�s older sibling, AP-H,
and the brief judgment that I gave in relation to that application is set out
at G41 of the bundle before me for this hearing.

��������� In that case, the parents
accepted that they were unable to look after A.� The mother had sought a late
adjournment of the case in order to allow for assessment of a number of
relations.

��������� The concerns about the
parents� care of A are reflected in a lengthy threshold document.� This
threshold document was agreed by the parents and was the basis of findings of
fact in relation to threshold in the proceedings concerning A.� In brief, the
headline issues were:

(i)� the risk to
A arising from the parents� abusive and volatile relationship - both parents
have convictions for violence against each other;

(ii)� the risk
of physical and emotional harm as a result of the parents� lack of appropriate
sexual boundaries - the parents had disclosed that Mr H masturbated in front of
a child;

(iii) �the
inability of the parents to protect A from sexual harm, in that a family member
who had abused Miss P was allowed to stay in the family home;

(iv) �the
mother�s mental health issues;

(v) �the
mother�s learning difficulties and their resultant impact on her ability to
provide adequate parenting.

��������� It will be seen from that
summary that there were a range of serious issues arising not only from the
mother�s innate difficulties and the impact of those on her individual
parenting, but also from the sexual risk from Mr H and mother�s inability to
protect a child in her care from that harm.

��������� In this case, the local
authority seeks, as I have said, care and placement orders.� Those applications
are supported by Eloise Dove, L�s guardian.� The parties have been represented
in these proceedings, save for Mr H, who has been served with notice of both
applications but declined to play any part in the court process.� Mr Bailey of
counsel has represented the local authority, Miss Burgess of counsel has
represented the mother and Mrs Bailey has represented L.� I am grateful to all
of the parties� representatives in this case.� As I said, the father, despite
service of the applications, has not played any part in these proceedings.� In
addition, he has only attended two contacts with L and the first statement of
the social worker records that, within those contacts, it was observed that he
found it hard to maintain a consistent and calm mood in L�s presence.

��������� The mother has participated
intermittently and on an inconsistent basis with her legal team and with social
care in relation to L.� The last contact that her legal team had with her prior
to her attendance at court for the start of this hearing was on the afternoon
of 14th March.� On that occasion she provided instructions for a
statement, indicating that she opposed threshold and opposed the local
authority applications.� Her case was that she had separated from Mr H and
wished to be assessed on that basis.

��������� She then failed to engage
with her solicitors and attend at their offices in order to sign her
statement.� She did not respond to messages left for her and, despite being
served with notice of the placement application on 22nd March by the
social worker who attended at her address and despite having indicated to the
social worker that she would attend court for the final hearing, it was 11.30 this
morning before the matter was called on.� She had not arrived.

��������� I adjourned the matter in
order to allow the mother�s counsel to make an attempt to contact the mother on
a landline telephone number, which the local authority provided in order to
make contact with the mother.� Miss Burgess managed to speak to the mother and
the mother then indicated that she wanted to come to court. �She explained that
she had been unwell and been to her GP, who advised her that she had a virus
and should not go out.� As I needed time to complete my reading anyway, the
mother did have time to get to court and, when she arrived, she instructed her
counsel that she wished to oppose the making of care and placement orders.

��������� In January of this year,
the mother had applied for permission to instruct a psychologist to undertake
an assessment of her alone as a prospective carer for L and the basis of that
application was said to be that the mother had separated from Mr H and wished
to put herself forward to care for L alone.� That application was refused.� Having
perused the documents filed by the parties in advance of that hearing, and
having been told what the submissions were of the parties at that hearing, it
would appear that the application was refused on the basis that the mother and Mr
H may have reunited.

��������� A court cannot make a
care order unless the circumstances at the relevant date are as set out in Section
31 of the Children Act:

�The child
concerned is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm

attributable
to the care given to the child or likely to be given to him if the

order were
not made not being what it would be reasonable to expect a

parent to
give to him.�

If the threshold
for the making of an order is established, the court must then consider the
local authority plans for the child, keeping the child�s welfare as the court�s
paramount consideration.� The court must take into account all of the relevant
circumstances of the case, but in particular the matters to which it is
directed in Section 1(3) of the Children Act and the court must remember that
any delay in determining the welfare decision is likely to prejudice the
child�s welfare.� I remind myself I should not make an order unless I consider
it would be better to do so than not.

��������� The local authority
applies for orders, the effect of which contemplates a permanent separation of L
from his birth family.� Article 8 and Article 6 of the ECHR are engaged in
relation to this application.

��������� Following the recent decisions
in the cases of Re B (a child) [2013] 

UKSC 33, Re G (a child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, Re P (a child) [2013] EWCA 

Civ 963, K v London Borough of
Brent [2013] EWCA Civ 926,

B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA 1146 and
W (a child) v Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council [2013] EWCA Civ 1125, I
must consider whether or not the permanent removal of L from his birth family
is proportionate to the risk of harm to him in his family�s care or the risks
associated with removal.� In evaluating which set of arrangements for L�s
future are to be endorsed, his welfare is paramount and the court must not
approach the task of deciding whether or not to approve a care plan in a linear
way but must undertake a global holistic evaluation of each of the options available
for the child�s future before deciding which of those options best meets the
duty to afford paramount consideration to the child�s welfare.

��������� I remind myself that an
order severing the ties between a child and his parents can only be made where
it is justified by the overriding requirement pertaining to the child�s
interests.� Adoption is, in the words of Lord Neuberger in Re B (a child)
[2013] UKSC 33, a very extreme thing, a last resort.� In short, the court must
be satisfied that nothing else will do.

��������� In considering the local
authority�s application for a placement order in respect of L, again I must
have L�s welfare as my paramount consideration and must bear in mind that any
delay is likely to prejudice his welfare.� I must have particular regard to the
matters set out in Section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act.� A court
cannot make a placement order unless the circumstances are as set out in
sections 21(2) and 21(3) of the Adoption and Children Act.� Section 21(3)
requires the court to examine whether or not parental consent has been given
and, if not, to consider whether or not to dispense with that consent, as set
out in 

Section 52 of the Act.� In this
case, the parents do not and will not consent and, in deciding whether or not
to dispense with their consent, I must be satisfied that adoption is in L�s
interests and that his welfare requires the court to dispense with his parents�
consent.

��������� In considering whether or
not to make a placement order, I bear in mind that a placement order is not
something which follows automatically from the making of a care order, even
where the care plan is for adoption.� I should only make such an order where I
am satisfied that all avenues to rehabilitation have reasonably been explored
and that the child is ready to be adopted.� The standard of proof in relation
to any disputed facts is the civil standard of proof, the balance of
probabilities and the burden of proof rests with the local authority.� It is
not reversible and it is not for the respondents to establish that allegations
are not made out.� Findings of fact must be based on evidence and not on
speculation.

��������� In this case, I have read
the bundle of documents which has been placed before me in advance of this
hearing and in addition a small placement bundle in relation to L.� I have read
all of the documents in both of those bundles and I have also heard oral
evidence from the allocated social worker, Elizabeth Davies, from the mother, SP
and also from the child�s guardian Eloise Dove.

��������� The evidence has focused,
unsurprisingly given the historic findings, on the extent to which there has
been any meaningful change in the mother�s circumstances since the conclusion
of the proceedings in relation to A, as she asserts that she has separated from
Mr H and wishes to be considered as a sole carer for L.

��������� The assessments within
the previous proceedings are however, in my judgment, relevant to the issues
before the court because they assist in relation to the mother�s capabilities
as a sole carer.

Within the
previous proceedings, there was an assessment of the mother by Astrid Pollard,
psychologist.� Her opinion, accepted by the court, was that the mother had a
mild learning disability.� She was unable to accept support from professionals
and had a lack of understanding of the emotional impact of events, such as a
child witnessing sexual activity or a parent failing to attend contact.� Astrid
Pollard identified that mother denied needing assistance in relation to her
parenting.� She expressed the opinion that it was unlikely that change could be
effected in the foreseeable future.� She diagnosed high levels of depression,
which required treatment, and she concluded that the mother would be unable to prioritise
her relationship with her children for any extended length of time.� In
addition, because of mother�s difficulties, she would struggle to plan and
undertake routine tasks but, were she willing to accept help, she could be
assisted to do that. �Finally she thought that it would be very difficult for
the mother to offer a good enough standard of emotional care to her own child
as a result of her own childhood experiences.

��������� There was also an
assessment of parenting undertaken by the Woodlands

Family Centre.� Again, that
evidence was before the court and was unchallenged in the proceedings in
relation to A.� The concluding analysis of that assessment notes that the
mother had been inconsistent in the care she provided A, sometimes refusing to
take on board advice and behaving in a very immature fashion.

��������� Importantly, in my judgment,
it was also observed that when the mother�s emotional needs were triggered, she
failed to focus on A and became very confused with routines.� She struggled to
understand the impact of domestic violence and, even though Mr H had been
observed to be regularly angry, she was found to be heavily reliant upon him.�
She was identified as being very vulnerable.� She was reluctant to change and
she did not think she needed to change her parenting and, to conclude,
Woodlands found that she lacked confidence to care for her child independently
and continued to be reliant on Mr H for support.

��������� Mr H was observed to have
shown an ability to meet A�s basic care needs, but it was also observed that
this was inconsistent and dependent on his emotional wellbeing and, sadly, the
conclusion therefore was that it was unlikely that either Miss P alone or
together with Mr H could offer safe and consistent care to A.

��������� Those assessments are
somewhat out of date but they were accepted by the court in the middle of last
year and, in my judgment, they contain highly relevant information in terms of
the mother�s functioning, Mr H�s functioning and their individual capabilities
as prospective carers for L.

��������� The mother gave evidence
before me and told me that she really wanted a chance to be able to care for L
by herself.� To that end, she told me that she had been staying with a friend
of hers over the last few weeks and that the only reason she had been found at
the flat that she used to share with Mr H was because she had returned there in
order to collect some more of her belongings.� She told me that Mr H remained
in her accommodation because she had asked him to move out on a number of
occasions but he had refused.� She was adamant that they were not a couple.�
She told me that she continues to suffer from depression and she takes
antidepressants.

��������� She complained about
domestic violence at the hands of Mr H.� Her application for a further
assessment indicates that she has separated from him and wishes to be
considered as L�s sole carer.� In that application, she accepted that 

Mr H resided in her property but
the application, dated 14/03/2013, says the respondent mother is residing with
her mother and has been so since she gave birth to L.� The respondent has only
returned to the property to let workmen in (fitting a new kitchen) whilst Mr H
was at work.

��������� In her statement dated 17th
January she says that Mr H was �domineering and controlling�.� She says: �I
fully accept I have a background of anger management issues but I am doing what
I can to address this and am on a waiting list for anger management classes.� I
have attended regular appointments with my GP and been prescribed
antidepressant medication.� My mother has registered me for therapy.� My anger
issues have been because I have been a victim of domestic violence at the hands
of Mr H and I came to a decision to end that abusive relationship, which has
ended in December 2013.� I am now going to attend a domestic violence freedom
project.�� And she then goes on to conclude: �I truly regret my relationship
with Mr H and I really have separated from him for good this time.� Losing A
has made me realise what I need to do to become a better parent for my
children.�

��������� Elizabeth Davies has been
the allocated social worker for L since January.� The last contact that the
mother had with L was on 23rd January of this year.� She had been
taken to contacts by her own mother but, after her mother stopped taking her,
Miss P stopped attending.� Since then, she has not attended contact at all.

��������� The social worker has
spoken to the mother on many occasions and she has been told by the mother that
she has separated from Mr H and on other occasions that they intended to remain
together.� In her first statement, she says this: �Miss P on numerous occasions
has asserted that she is leaving Mr H but to date they are still very much a
couple.� They live together and share the same bedroom.� The flat they share is
only a one bedroom flat.� During my visits throughout the months of January and
February, Mr H and Ms P were still living together as a couple.� The fact is
that Miss P cannot operate independently of Mr H.� Miss P informed me that she
cannot look after L without the support of Mr H� and she describes Miss P as
saying to her: �After all, he is the father.�

��������� The social worker thought
that this pattern of separation and reconciliation between the parents was
similar to their behaviour in the proceedings concerning A.� 

��������� The social worker filed a
further statement, setting out the recent enquiries

she had made shortly before the
final hearing and she referred to a conversation she had with HP, the maternal
grandmother, on 21st March.� She had visited HP in order to speak to
her but also with a view to making contact with SP.� HP told her: �That she had
not seen SP for a couple of days.� However they both� � and that is HP and her
partner DL - �confirmed that SP was still living with SH.� Mrs P said: �S will
never leave S although she knows he is no good for her but she will not leave
him.�

��������� On 22nd March,
Elizabeth Davies had visited the mother�s flat in order to serve the mother and
SH with the placement papers.� She said this: �I telephoned SP on her landline,
for which she was most annoyed, demanding to know how I obtained the number.� SP
stated she does not wish to speak to me because, in her words, I took all three
of her children.� She stated because Social Services wants her to separate from
the father of her children. �With that, SP spoke to me and said they would not
ever be separating.�

��������� She goes on to say: ��I
put the documents through the letter box and left.� Hearing Mr H�s voice from
the flat as he swore has led me to conclude that they are still living together
and they have both asserted that they are never going to separate.� It would
appear therefore that SP says one thing and behaves entirely differently.�

��������� The social worker was
cross-examined when she gave oral evidence about the assertion she made in her
oral evidence that the mother had also said on this occasion that she would not
separate from Mr H.� That is not recorded directly in

the extract that I have set out
from her recent statement.

��������� It is right that it is
not recorded but I do not accept, having heard the oral evidence of the social
worker, that the social worker was wrong in her evidence on this point because
the second paragraph does include the social worker�s evidence that the parents
have both asserted that they are never going to separate.� However, even if I
am wrong about that and this sentence did not relate to the conversation that
the social worker had with the mother on that particular day, I accept the
social worker�s evidence that the mother has said to her on occasions that she
will not separate from Mr H and I do not think therefore, even if the social
worker was confused about the specific conversation which took place on the 22nd,
that the criticism that is made in more general terms of her evidence on this
point can be sustained.

��������� The fact is that, in this
case, there appear to have been numerous separations and reconciliations and
the social worker may simply have become confused about what the mother said.�
The statement, although the grammar is a little odd, does make it clear that
one of the reasons why the mother did not want to speak to the social worker on
the 22nd was because the social worker wanted her to separate from Mr
H and it seems to me therefore that, even if mother did not say directly that
she was refusing to separate from Mr H on this occasion, it may well have been
implied.

��������� The social worker had
further contact from SP on Monday, 24th March, when the mother
called her to tell her that: �SH had been lying to social services.� SH visits
his mother at least two times a week and he sees A� � that is the parents�
oldest child � �when he is not allowed to see A.� She stated that he then comes
home as late as 12.30 and wants a cup of tea and food.� During this
conversation the mother confirmed to the social worker that she had received
the court documents left for her on the 22nd.�

��������� The social worker relies
on this conversation and the conversation that took place on the 22nd
to support her assertion that, despite the mother�s statement that she has left
SH, she has in fact done nothing of the sort and they continue to cohabit in
SP�s flat, otherwise the mother would not have made the observation that Mr H
comes home as late as 12.30 and wants a cup of tea and food.� That appears to
me to be compelling evidence which does support the social worker�s case.

��������� In the most recent
statement, the social worker says that she visited the home of the grandmother,
who said she had not seen the mother for a couple of days.� Both she and her
partner had confirmed to the social worker that they were still together.

��������� The guardian, in her
three reports to the court, highlights the similarity between the actions of
the parents in these proceedings and their repeated separations and
reconciliations in the proceedings concerning A.� In addition, she points to
the fact that the parents frequently requested contact and then failed to
attend.� She observed in her report dated 9th March that the parents
continued to live together and that her enquiries indicated they remained in a
relationship with each other.� She had visited HP on 29th January
for a pre-arranged visit with the mother and she was told by HP that the mother
was not there and in fact, contrary to her assertion in her application for
further assessment that she had been staying at the grandmother�s since L�s
birth, the grandmother told the guardian that she had never stayed there
overnight.� Grandmother and step-maternal grandfather told the guardian that,
after a period of lying about their relationship, they had been told by the
mother and father that they were no longer considering separating, as they had
addressed the difficulties between them.

��������� I have considered all of
this evidence about the relationship between Mr H and SP and I have come to the
clear conclusion that they have remained living together as a couple throughout
these proceedings.� The mother has not been able or willing to sustain any sort
of meaningful separation from Mr H.� Despite the mother�s assertion that she
has separated from him, I believe the social worker�s evidence that the parents
confirmed to her that they continued to be in a relationship in January of this
year.� I also believed the guardian�s evidence, that the grandparents confirmed
to her that the mother and Mr H continued to reside together as a couple and in
a relationship and the social worker�s evidence about what the grandparents
said to her.

��������� Although I have heard no
evidence from the grandmother or her partner, I cannot imagine that this is a
subject about which they have any interest in deceiving the social worker or
the guardian.� The information they provided was in the context of offering an
explanation as to why the mother was not at the grandmother�s address as the
social worker and guardian had expected her to be.� The mother does not deny
that she was not at her mother�s address.� She has offered a different
explanation.� She has asserted that the reason she did not attend contact was
because she was required to wait at her flat for builders and that she has been
at her flat in relation to her requirement, the necessity for her to be at her
flat for that reason.

��������� The reality is that what
can clearly be observed in the history of these proceedings is a pattern of
inconsistency in relation to the mother�s position as to what should happen in
relation to Mr H.� She has fluctuated between moving between wanting L back
with her and Mr H, wanting to live with her parents and wanting to look after
him separately and saying that she has separated from him.

��������� Having had an opportunity
to observe mother in the witness box and her sometimes emotional response to
some of the questions, she impressed me as a relatively unsophisticated and
vulnerable witness.� I have no doubt that she loves her son and wants the best
for him, but her responses indicated, at best, a very basic understanding of
professional concerns and, in my judgment, a real lack of insight into the
deficiencies in her parenting and to the risks that there would be to a child
in either her care or in the care of her and Mr H.� She continues to maintain
that she has separated from Mr H but I simply did not believe her and, as the
hearing progressed, I formed the view that she was saying what she thought she
needed to say in order to strengthen her case.

��������� It is submitted on behalf
of the mother that it is difficult for women who have been the victim of
domestic violence to separate from their partners and that it is unsurprising
that someone as vulnerable as SP, with her profile of difficulties, should have
been unable to be assertive and demand Mr H leaves her flat and the social
worker is criticised for not assisting the mother in relation to achieving this
outcome.

I have no
difficulty accepting the general proposition that it is difficult for women who
have been the victims of domestic violence to extricate themselves from violent
relationships and I can see that, for someone like SP, it would be even more
difficult to do so, but this is a situation which is far more complex than that
straightforward analysis.� SP is not only a victim of domestic violence at the
hands of Mr H, she has also perpetrated domestic violence against Mr H.� In
2012, she was convicted of an offence of battery against him.� The
psychological assessment of Mr H within A�s proceedings identified his cognitive
abilities were in the borderline range and that he presented as being na�ve,
lacking in reflection, in such a way as to impede his ability to listen and act
on advice and he is also identified as probably suffering from periods of
anxiety.� I note in this regard that, when the social worker visited the
mother�s flat on 22nd March, Mr H had said to her that he was unable
to open the door because SP would not let him. 

��������� The reality is that, in
this situation, the relationship between the parents is one of mutual dependence
in the context of their both having significant cognitive and personality
difficulties which impact upon their parenting.� Both have anger management
issues, which mean it would be unsafe for a child to be in their care as
individuals or together.� In addition, there is a concern about the sexual risk
posed

by Mr H.

��������� The guardian is concerned
that, in the very few contacts which have taken place, the mother has struggled
to meet with L�s need for adequate basic parenting.� In addition, she has not
demonstrated sufficient commitment to L by attending, the last contact she
attended being in January 2014.� Mr H has not really demonstrated any
commitment whatsoever to L, having failed to participate in the proceedings and
failed to attend contact more than twice during his short life.

��������� The mother�s explanation
for her failure to maintain contact is that she had been told she was required
to wait in her property to allow builders access to her council flat.� I think
this evidence is significant, firstly because it confirms the evidence of the
other witnesses, that in fact the mother remains in the flat with 

Mr H, and secondly, in my judgment,
it is simply not credible that an adult who has been unable to attend contact
over a period of 2 months to a very young baby fails to attend that contact as
a result of having to wait in for builders.� I do not believe her.� I think
this is a lie she has fabricated in order to excuse her lack of commitment to L.

��������� I am reinforced in my
view that this is the correct analysis by the social worker�s evidence that the
mother had asked for contacts to take place the day before the final hearing
and L was made available for that contact by the local authority.� Even then,
so close to the final hearing and after the mother told me that she was staying
with her friend C, the mother failed to attend that contact.

��������� Another example of the
mother�s failure to engage or show sufficient

commitment to L is that she failed
to engage with her solicitor in the run up to this hearing.� The only reason
she appeared at the hearing was because I stood the matter back in order to
allow her counsel to contact her on a telephone number.� Mother did come to
court in response to that call but I am quite satisfied she was aware of the
hearing in advance of today as a result of having received the papers from
Elizabeth Davies on the 22nd.� Even having received those papers,
she took no steps to provide instructions to her solicitor, nor to attend court
to participate in the hearing until contact was made with her.� At the hearing
she explained she had not seen her solicitor because she had been diagnosed
with an illness by her GP and advised to stay indoors but I note that, having
been contacted by her counsel, she then decided she did want to come to court.

��������� I do not accept that
having a virus means she was unable to provide her solicitor with instructions
for the hearing.� In any event, even if this were a valid reason for her
failing to engage, I accept the social worker�s evidence that she had made
arrangements with her to have contact with L the day before the hearing and she
failed to attend that contact.� It seems to me she would not have made that
arrangement if she had been unwell and unable to attend as she now asserts but,
even if I am wrong about that, there was no reason why the mother could not
cancel the arrangement for contact, speak to her solicitor on the phone or call
her solicitor or the court on the morning of the hearing to advise that she was
unwell and unable to attend.

��������� I see all of these
examples as further examples of the established pattern of

the mother and Mr H being unable to
be consistent, not only in their engagement with social care but in their
management of these proceedings and in their attendance for contact.

��������� So, for all of the above
reasons to which I have already referred in this judgment, I am entirely
satisfied that the mother and Mr H remain as a couple and that the deficiencies
in the mother�s parenting have not been addressed in between the conclusion of
the proceedings for A. 

I find, firstly, that there has
been no material change in the mother�s lack of capability to care for a child
safely.� In my judgment, any child would be at risk of physical harm in her
care by virtue of her inability to control her temper or emotional harm as a
result of witnessing volatility between his parents.� Secondly, L would likely
be neglected in either his mother�s or his father�s care or the care of both of
them.� Thirdly, the father poses a risk of physical and sexual harm to L.� Fourthly,
the mother is unable to protect L from the father and, fifthly, the father is
unable to protect L from the mother.� Consequently, it follows from everything
that I have said that there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that the
threshold for the making of an order under Section 31 of the Children Act is
established overwhelmingly in relation to L.

��������� Moving on to consider
what order if any I should make in relation to L, L is a young baby.� He has
the need of any young baby for safe care, security and nurture.� He is far too
young to express any wishes or feelings which the court could take into
consideration and his physical, emotional and educational needs are

the same and will be the same as
any young baby has.

��������� The local authority has
explored whether or not he can be cared for in his birth family.� It has
conducted assessments of a number of individuals put forward by the family and
sadly it has concluded - rightly in my judgment - that he cannot be cared for
safely by any member of his birth family.� It would obviously be better for L
if he could be cared for within his family as that placement would offer him
the opportunity to grow up in his own family and be reassured of his parents�
love for him.� However, I accept the excellent final analysis of the guardian
in this case.� In this scenario, L would be exposed to the risk of sexual
abuse, neglect of his needs because of the significant limitations of both of
his parents, physical and emotional abuse from exposure to domestic violence.�
The lack of commitment demonstrated towards him by his parents thus far would
also cause me to question whether he would receive any real reassurance of
their love for him if he were placed in their care.

��������� I agree with both the
local authority and the guardian that the only realistic option, given L�s very
young age, is alternative care from that offered by his parents, in the form of
an adoptive placement.� Long-term foster care could not offer him the full
sense of belonging and security and legal security which L requires and in any
event the history demonstrates, as the guardian indicates, that his parents
would be unlikely to be able to commit to on-going contact in a way that would
ensure that L�s emotional needs were met if he were to grow up in foster care.

��������� L will undoubtedly suffer
emotional harm as a result of losing an opportunity to have relationships with
his birth family and to grow up in his birth family.� This will be a life-long
enduring loss.� However, in my judgment, his need to be protected from the many
risks that there would be to him were he to remain in the care of his parents,
both in the short and the long term, outweighs the harm he would suffer as a
result of losing relationships with his birth family.

��������� I note from the local
authority�s care plan that there is a possibility that L may be able to be
placed for adoption alongside his sibling A.� It is unclear presently whether
or not this could happen but, if that were achievable, it would obviously
afford L an opportunity to grow up together with a sibling and this would
reduce his feelings of loss in connection with his adoption outside his birth
family.� The care plan provides for a reduction in contact between L and his
birth family which, in the circumstances, is entirely appropriate.� The plan
does provide for L to have an opportunity to have indirect contact with his
parents at a frequency of once per annum and I consider this to be a contact
plan which meets L�s need to have an understanding of his family of origin and
his identity.

��������� There is a pressing need
for plans to be implemented for L without delay.

L is a child who is ready to be
adopted.� I have come to the firm conclusion that the only plan which meets L�s
needs is one of adoption and that plan needs to be implemented without delay.�
Consequently, I have no hesitation in concluding that L�s welfare requires me
to, firstly, make a care order to the local authority, secondly to dispense
with his parents� consent to adoption and, thirdly, to make a

placement order to the local authority
and that concludes this judgment.

JUDGMENT������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 2nd
April 2014

THE HONOURABLE Mr
JUSTICE MOOR:

1.            
This
is an application for the committal to prison of Mr John McQueen, the maternal
grandfather of P, who is fifteen years of age.

The background

2.            
P
is in Local Authority foster care as a result of a hearing before Her Honour
Judge Parry on 25th October 2007, when on the balance of
probabilities Judge Parry made findings of sexual abuse against Mr McQueen
on P.� I do not need to deal any further with that.� Mr McQueen appealed
and his appeal was refused on 14th January 2008.

3.            
I
am of course only concerned with the allegations in relation to the committal,
but it is right to say that there came a time during 2013 when the Local
Authority applied first for a Prohibitive Steps Order and then for an
injunction pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction to prevent Mr McQueen from
contacting P.� On 21st November 2013 Mr Recorder Tillyard QC
heard the application for the Order, pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction.�
The maternal grandfather was present in Court and the Learned Judge gave the Local
Authority permission to issue an application for an Order pursuant to the
Court�s inherent jurisdiction.� The Learned Judge made an injunction that Mr
McQueen was not to initiate (either himself or through any other person) any
direct or indirect contact with P and he was not to communicate either through
himself or through any other person with P.� The Order was set to expire on 6th
March 2015.� A penal notice was attached.� The Judge, as is clear from the
transcript that I have, warned Mr McQueen that the injunction applied even
if P was to contact him.� He had to have no contact with P.

4.            
The
Local Authority�s notice to show cause alleges contact in two separate
respects:

(i)           
via
social media, namely Facebook; and

(ii)         
attempted
contact by telephone.

The law

5.            
The
burden of proof is on he who alleges the contempt, namely in this case the
Local Authority.� The defendant does not have to prove anything.� The standard
of proof is the criminal standard.� In other words, I must be satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt before I can find contempt proved.� To use the language of the
Crown Court, I have to be sure.

6.            
I
make it clear that Mr McQueen does not have to prove anything.� He has not
given evidence. That is his right.� I draw absolutely no inferences whatsoever
from that.� I merely consider the evidence that is brought before me by the Local
Authority.� That consists of two statements, namely:

(i)           
one
from Ms PH, a senior social worker, who has given oral evidence before me; and

(ii)         
one
from Ms PS, who is another social worker employed by the Local Authority, whose
statement is not in dispute.

7.            
The
allegations are in part admitted on behalf of Mr McQueen, albeit that when he
admits the allegations he says that there is mitigation.� Obviously, I will
have to consider that mitigation when I come to deal with the question of
sentence.

The first series of allegations

8.            
It
is admitted by Mr McQueen that there was contact between him and P via Facebook
on 16th February 2014.� It appears that P�s mobile telephone had
been cut off.� On 15th February 2014, it is right to note that P
attempted to contact Mr McQueen to discover whether or not he had paid the bill
and whether or not that was the reason why P could not ring anyone or text
anyone on the phone.� It is entirely right to say that on 15th February
2014 Mr McQueen, quite properly, did not respond to P�s messages to him.

9.            
On
16th February 2014 P tried again at 10:50 in the morning, saying:

�What�s
wrong with my phone, it�s saying the numbers are blocked cos you ain�t paid the
bill� (although it says �bull�).

Mr
McQueen responded at 10:58.� He said:

�Can
I trust you not to tell anyone cos I could go to prison and I know you don�t
want that to happen?�

10.        
That
is a clear breach of the injunction.� I find to the criminal standard of proof
that it was a breach, although I accept that Mr Lock may have some mitigation
in relation to that breach.

11.        
At�
10:58 P responded saying:

�No,
I won�t, trust me. What�s wrong with my phone?�

At
11:02 Mr McQueen replied:

�I
will phone you in a bit, ok�.

12.        
That
is a second breach of the injunction of which I am satisfied to the criminal
standard of proof.

13.        
At
11:02 P replied:

�You
can�t, it won�t let no-one ring me or it won�t let me ring them�.

At
11:06 Mr McQueen responded:

�I�ll
tell you tonight when I get home, ok�.

14.        
That
is a third breach of the injunction of which I am satisfied to the criminal
standard of proof.

15.        
P
replied at 11:07:

�Ok�.

At
11:12 Mr McQueen said:

�You
cannot tell a soul about this, I love you xxxxx�.

16.        
This
was the fourth breach about which I am satisfied to the criminal standard of
proof.

17.        
At
11:12 P wrote:

�I
won�t dw�.

Mr
McQueen answered at 11:14:

�Ok�.

And
at 11:27 there was some further message from P about which I am unclear.

At
12:31, however, Mr McQueen sent a much longer message.� It is as follows:

�I
did not pay bill on time.� I will pay bill on Thursday and the phone will be
back on then.� I know it is in Court about you.� We are waiting for funding
then our solicitors can fight to bring you home to live with us if that is what
you want.� But before that can happen you need to tell the truth that I neither
did those things to you and they made you lie, and we will be on your side, and
if you want to see us you will have to ask for Contact Order then I will be
able to see you.� That�s all I can say.� You are a clever girl, you know what
to do for you to be able to come back home where you belong and where you are
loved.� You are part of our family and once it is sorted we would welcome you
back with open arms, so I will wait for it to happen.� That�s all I can say for
the time being, we love you xxxxx bye for now�.

18.        
Again,
that is a clear and serious breach of the injunction of which I am satisfied to
the criminal standard of proof.

19.        
At
12:33 P responded:

�I
can�t try and yet I know what to do, but the thing is no-one listens to me, not
no-one.� I tried to tell it 100 times but they don�t listen to me, and yet I
want to come with you, but they won�t allow it�.

At
12:40 Mr McQueen replied:

�The
Court will decide and not them, where you can have your say what you want and
where you want to live.� Happy birthday for (date)�.

20.        
That
is another clear breach of the injunction of which I am satisfied to the
criminal standard of proof.

21.        
At
12:42 P wrote:

�Ah,
thanks, my birthday ain�t till (month), it�s (different month), and they decide
what they want for me, that�s what they reckon�.

Mr
McQueen then failed to answer a call from her.� At 21:04 he sent a message to
her:

�What�s
up?�

She
replied:

�Nothing
dw�.

And
she later, at 21:13 said,

�Tell
 Nan to add me on Facebook�.

22.        
That
concludes the allegations in relation to Facebook, and as I have already
indicated, I find them proved to the criminal standard.

The second allegation

23.        
The
second allegation concerns the evening of 5th March 2014 when Ms HP
visited P in the evening at her respite placement.� This allegation is in
dispute.

24.        
Whilst
Ms HP was present with P her telephone rang.� The telephone monitor indicated
that the call was from Mr McQueen as his name came up on the telephone.� P
showed Ms HP the phone, and Ms HP asked her if she wanted Ms HP to answer it.� P
said,

�No,
I will get into trouble�.

So
the call ended. 

25.        
About
20 minutes later the telephone rang again, and again the monitor said it was
Mr McQueen calling.�� P on this occasion told Ms HP to answer it, which
she did.� Ms HP did not say anything and Mr McQueen said,

�Hello�.

26.        
Hereafter
Ms HP�s evidence is in dispute.� Ms HP says that she said, �Hello� back,
and that the man on the other end of the phone said,

�Who
is this?�

And
then said,

�I
think I have the wrong number�.

Ms
HP asked him who he wanted to speak to, and he again said he had the wrong
number.� Ms HP asked him again who he wanted to speak to and he replied,

�I
didn�t phone anyone called P�.

So
Ms HP replied,

�I
know this is Mr McQueen�,

and
she said that she was P�s social worker.� Upon informing him who she was, she
says Mr McQueen immediately ended the call.� She says she knows for certain it
was Mr McQueen as she has met him previously.� Indeed, there is no dispute that
it was Mr McQueen who had telephoned.

27.        
I
have already indicated that Mr McQueen does not have to prove anything, and he
has not given evidence, but he has filed a statement in which he says that on
that evening he accidentally called P on two occasions.� He says he did not
realise his mistake until a female voice answered the phone.� He says he had
intended to call his son R, but he was walking in public when he made the call,
and did not have his glasses to see the phone correctly.� Of course I
interpolate here to accept that it was in the evening and it would have been
dark.

28.        
Rather
than calling R he says he had accidentally called P as the numbers are saved in
his telephone next to each other.� He adds that he was not able to read the
names properly without his glasses.� He says it was entirely accidental.� 

29.        
Ms
HP gave oral evidence before me and was cross-examined.� Through Mr McQueen�s
solicitor� advocate, Mr Lock, it was put to Ms HP that her recollection is
incorrect and that Mr McQueen did not say,

�I
didn�t phone anyone called P�.

30.       
I
accept Ms HP�s evidence.� I find that she has absolutely no reason to fabricate
this part of her evidence.� She noted it down in a hand written note very
shortly afterwards.� My recollection is that she said she did this between 10 and
15 minutes afterwards when she got back into her car.� She then sent an email
on 6th March at 08:08 in the morning, which again repeats verbatim
what happened.

31.        
I
am quite satisfied, having heard Ms HP�s evidence, that she is a witness of
truth and that she told me exactly what had happened on that evening.

My conclusions

32.        
I
therefore have to consider where that takes me.� I have admitted breaches from Mr
McQueen in relation to Facebook.� I have not one, but two occasions on which he
alleges he dialled the wrong telephone number, approximately 20 minutes apart.�
When the phone was answered he did not immediately (or at any time) say, �Is
this R?� I�m terribly sorry.� I was trying to phone my son R.� I have got the
wrong number.� This is a terrible error�.� He said,

�Who
is this?�

And
then he said,

�I
think I have the wrong number�.

33.        
I
am satisfied so that I am sure that he twice said he had the wrong number, but
when asked who he wanted to speak to, he replied,

�I
didn�t phone anyone called P�.

34.        
Given
that my finding to the criminal standard is that he said,

�I
didn�t phone anyone called P�,

I
am satisfied so that I am sure, that he did deliberately attempt to telephone P
on two occasions on that evening.

35.        
He
was, as a consequence, in breach of the injunction, and when he realised that
the social worker was on the other end he hung up.� I am therefore satisfied to
the criminal standard that the Local Authority has proved both sets of
allegations, namely the allegations in relation to Facebook, and the two
attempted calls on the evening of 5th March 2014.

HIS HONOUR JUDGE LOCHRANE: 

 

1.               
This is the conclusion
of a fact finding process in respect of allegations made by the mother, Miss RT, against the father, PC.

 

2.               
The background to this
fact finding process is cross-applications between the parents concerning the
children of the parties, A, who was born on 18th January 2008; B,
born on 15th June 2009; C, born on 25th January 2011, and
D, born on 22nd August 2012.� The children currently all reside with
their mother, following a change in arrangements which occurred in the latter
part of last year, to which I shall return in a moment.� 

 

3.               
It is apparent from the
evidence that the children have not had any contact with their father at all
since November of last year.� There is an order for supervised contact to
continue to take place, which the father has clearly not taken up.� It is
apparent that the contact between the father and the children ceased at more or
less the same time, pretty much exactly the same time, as the mother�s then
property was the subject of an arson attack, when someone put a lighted
firework through the letter box during the night, so when the children were in
bed. It is significantly more by luck, probably, than planning that no greater
damage was caused than was in fact caused, which was some, mercifully
comparatively minor, fire damage to the hallway of the property.� Certainly,
the perpetrator of that offence, when putting the lighted firework through the
letter box, could not possibly have anticipated anything other than that he or
she was placing the lives of the occupants of the property at risk.� 

 

4.               
The parties were
married in 2012.� They have been together for some considerable time.� There is
some dispute as to exactly when they became romantically involved.� Miss T, the
mother, suggests that she was under 16 at the time when their relationship
commenced.� Mr. C, I think, suggests that she was already 16 at the time when
their romantic arrangements commenced.� There is a significant disparity in age
between the parties, Mr. C now being in his mid forties, Miss T now in her mid
twenties.� As I said, there are four children who are the subject of the
applications which are before the court and which have necessitated this fact
finding process.� 

 

5.               
Originally, for reasons
which I do not think I need to go into, the parties separated back in the
course of 2013 and the mother moved out.� The arrangements to begin with were
that the parties shared the former family home on a three day on three day off
basis with the children staying in the property being looked after by whichever
parent was entitled, as it were, to the then current three day period.� That
came to an end in the course of September of 2013 when at the conclusion of one
of the father�s periods of shared residence the youngest child, D, was found to
have not insignificant injuries, for which, it is suggested, as yet no adequate
explanation has been provided.� 

 

6.               
The injuries to D form
the subject of one of the allegations contained in the schedule, and I will
return to the detail in due course.� But as a consequence of the involvement of
the professionals, and indeed the police, I think, at the time, in relation to
the injuries to D, the arrangements were changed.� The Local Authority became
involved and the father�s contact thereafter was supervised, until it ceased
altogether, as I have said, in November.

 

7.               
I remind myself, of
course, at the outset that the mother brings these allegations for the purposes
of this fact finding process, and it is for the mother to prove to me, on the
balance of probabilities, that the evidence supports the making of the findings
which she seeks.� She has been represented at these proceedings by Mr. Simison
of counsel, with his usual professional approach.� 

 

8.               
The father is not
represented in these proceedings.� He was originally represented by
solicitors.� The solicitors came off the record in the early part of this
year.� The father was present personally when the order fixing the hearing for
these two days was made by me, and indeed, as Mr. Simison reminds me, the dates
fixed were fixed in consultation with Mr. C in order to accommodate his
availability, and that of his then proposed witnesses, primarily, I think, his
daughter by a different relationship, E.� The father has not attended these two
days of this hearing.� It is very apparent that he has had some considerable
warning of these proceedings, and indeed this date.� Indeed, as I have already
indicated, the momentum for a fact finding hearing, and the specific fixing of
these dates for a fact finding hearing, were the responsibility of the father
and reflected his convenience.� 

 

9.               
I have seen a small
bundle of correspondence from the solicitors instructed by the mother to the
address given by the father in the notice served by him that he was acting on
his own behalf, that address being his mother�s address.� So I have seen a
bundle of correspondence dealing with preparations for this hearing and seeking
the father�s input.� He has not responded to any of that correspondence, he has
not provided the evidence in accordance with the order which I made, and, as I
have said, he does not appear.� Statements have been filed on his behalf in the
past, as they have on behalf of the mother, and I now have a relatively
significant volume of police disclosure which deals with a number of different
matters.� 

 

10.          
On the basis that there
has been no communication whatsoever from the father to the court, or to the
solicitors instructed on behalf of the mother, the decision was taken to
proceed with this matter as clearly the time has been set aside and there was
no information upon which the court could sensibly adjourn the matter with a
view to the father attending and making his case.� In those circumstances, Mr.
Simison has called his evidence, and I have heard from three witnesses on
behalf of the mother, the mother herself, Mr. SJ, a neighbour, and the mother�s
current partner, Mr. CH, who was, at the time of the relevant incidents, a
neighbour. He did not become romantically involved with the mother until after
her separation from Mr. C.

 

11.          
There are 15
allegations contained in the schedule before me.� Mr. Simison, on behalf of the
mother, indicated at the outset that three of those allegations he accepted
could not form part of the mother�s submissions in relation to findings which
she could sensibly invite the court to make.� 

 

12.          
The first is number 1
on the list, which relates to allegations as long ago as 2003, and clearly deal
with Mr. C�s previous wife, who is the mother of four of his children, three
boys and a girl.� There is, in addition, A, who is the child of another
relationship and born prior to the four children who were the product of a
relationship with his previous wife.� Mr. Simison accepts that he is not in a
position, clearly, to advance evidence to support the allegation contained at
number 1, which is an assault on the previous wife.� 

 

13.          
The background,
however, accepted in Mr. C�s own statement, is that he no longer has contact
with the four children of that relationship. That is dealt with, to some
extent, in the report of the social worker, who indicates that there is some
considerable reluctance on those children�s part to have contact with their
father.� I do not think that is explained in any greater detail, but,
nonetheless, it appears to be the case from the social worker�s evidence, that
there is no contact between the father and his children from his previous
marriage, and that is in no small measure because the children themselves are
reluctant to have contact with their father.� So allegation number 1 is no
longer pursued.� 

 

14.          
The second allegation
which is not pursued by Mr. Simison, on behalf of the mother, is that contained
at number 13 on the schedule, which relates to attacks by somebody on Mr. H� vehicle.�
It is apparent, I think, that Mr. H has had one car set alight, and also that
his car has been scratched.� The offences occurred at the time, more or less,
when the relationship was breaking down and others of these allegations were
taking place, but, again, Mr. Simison cannot suggest the evidence before the
court supports a possible conclusion that Mr. C was actually responsible,
whether directly or indirectly, for those attacks on Mr. H� vehicle.� A
suspicion is clearly raised but a suspicion is certainly not good enough for
the purposes of making a finding.� 

 

15.          
The final matter upon
which Mr. Simison accepts he is not in a position to ask the court to make findings
is that of the incident of the firework being pushed through the letter box.�
Unsurprisingly, that has been the subject of police investigation, and the
police have taken the decision not to prosecute Mr. C.� There is in the police
disclosure, among other things, a statement from Mr. C�s mother in which she
indicates that he has an alibi for the purposes of that investigation.� She
indicates that throughout the relevant day he was in her company.� She did not,
of course, appear, and that evidence has not been tested in any way, but,
nonetheless, that is a statement on the file. As I understand it from Mr.
Simison, there is also fingerprint evidence from the firework itself. A
fingerprint was obtained but it does not appear to have been Mr. C�s fingerprint.�
Again, whilst there is clearly, given the timing, a suspicion that Mr. C might
have been involved, whether directly or indirectly, a suspicion, clearly, is
not sufficient for a finding. No finding is sought and no finding is made in
respect of that.� Nonetheless, following that incident Miss T and the children
have moved to an address which is not disclosed to Mr. C, and no other person,
as I understand it, has been prosecuted for this extremely dangerous and
concerning offence on 1st December of last year. 

 

16.          
That takes me to the
remaining 12 allegations upon which the mother does seek findings.� In
September last year the mother obtained a non molestation order under the
Family Law Act 1996.� Two of the allegations relate to breaches of that order,
for which Mr. C has subsequently been found guilty and punished in the
Magistrates Court.� Those are clearly criminal findings, whether they be on the
basis of a plea of guilty or not, and they are not findings which, accordingly,
could �be revisited by this court.� It is clear that he has been found guilty
in the Criminal Court beyond reasonable doubt, and it is must be accepted,
certainly absent any submissions on his behalf, that he is, for these purposes,
found to have committed those offences. The evidence clearly supports a finding
on those allegations. Those allegations are, firstly, that on 18th
September, almost immediately following the making of the non molestation
order, the father attended at the mother�s property, in breach of that order,
and made insulting gestures and remarks. He received a community order.
Secondly, on 7th November he further breached the order by sending
text messages to the mother which made it plain that he was observing,
stalking, I suppose, the mother in her home.� In her evidence before me the
mother told me, and I accept, that in order to make the comments he did make in
the text messages, for which he was convicted, he must either have been looking
over the fence at the bottom of the garden or actually have been in the garden
itself in order to be able to observe through the living room window.
Accordingly, in respect of two of the allegations out of the 12 remaining,
there can be no sensible conclusion other than that the facts and the evidence
support the allegations as set out.� 

 

17.          
As I have said, I heard
evidence from the mother, Mr J the neighbour, and Mr. H, the then neighbour,
now partner.� I certainly have not, in the course of that evidence, had any
cause to doubt that the mother is doing anything other than telling the truth.�
Indeed, I am comforted that there does not appear in any of the evidence of the
three witnesses before me to be any attempt by them to exaggerate any of the
incidents in which they were involved in a way which might well have been
understandable given that Mr. C is not here to gainsay what they have to say.� 

 

18.          
One of the incidents,
to which I shall return, is allegation number 5, for example, where it is
suggested that the father threw a mobile telephone which struck the mother
giving her a black eye.� The father has a somewhat different take on it,
although he accepts, broadly speaking, that he did throw it and it did come
into contact with her head. The mother, having suffered a not insignificant
injury as a result, was, in fact, quite generous in her evidence in respect of
the father, as I say, given particularly the fact that he is not here to
gainsay what she might tell me about it.� What she said in her evidence was
that he was on that occasion drunk, and he did throw his phone around a lot
when he was angry, but on this occasion she was not at all convinced that he actually
threw it at her with the intention of hitting her.� Her evidence was that he
threw it in her direction and it might have been that it struck her
accidentally.� That, as I say, is clearly not an effort on her part to
exaggerate, or indeed to present the circumstances in a light which is the most
unfavourable to the father.� I am encouraged by the quality of her evidence, in
the fact that in that respect, and some others, she has shown herself capable
of being quite objective and clear in her recollection, and not prone to
exaggeration.

 

19.          
Both Mr. J and Mr. H in
giving their evidence have described the general demeanour of Mr. C and his
very significant alcohol consumption.� But, again, in both cases, whilst they
have described his somewhat unpleasant demeanour when drunk, or under the
influence of drink, neither has sought to exaggerate the physical aspects of
his poor behaviour when in drink, and each has said that he in fact has only
observed physically violent behaviour on one occasion.� I am encouraged, again,
in the veracity of their evidence by the fact that they have not, in my
judgment, sought to exaggerate in any way when the opportunity presented itself
and they might easily have taken it.� 

 

20.          
Returning then to the
allegations.� The first allegation which the father, apparently, disputes is
that at number 2, which is that throughout the relationship the father exerted
controlling behaviour towards the mother and controlled her relationship with her
family and her friends.� It is a picture with which we are comparatively
familiar in cases involving domestic violence.� The father denies it,� but
contained in the police disclosure is a statement made by the mother in August
2013 in which she describes at some considerable length the sort of behaviour
she complains of in the schedule, and it is a picture which is, as I have said,
not an unfamiliar one.� It involves abusive behaviour, largely verbal but
occasionally physically, which usually is followed by a period of apparent
remorse which persuades the victim to give the perpetrator another chance.� It
is a picture, as I have said, with which we are very familiar.� I entirely
accept the mother�s evidence in respect of that.� 

 

21.          
The evidence is supported,
to some extent, by Mr. J and Mr. H, who both describe the father as being
entirely capable of being extremely spiteful and unpleasant when in drink, and
domineering and vulgar.� That fits the pattern, it seems to me, and I entirely
accept the mother�s evidence that the father did behave on a regular basis in
that way. I find the evidence supports the allegation contained at item number
2.����� 

 

22.          
In respect of
allegation number 3, the mother alleges in her statement that the father threw
a glass at her after he had been drinking.� She was pregnant at the time.� It
is contained in her statement at p.B2, and, once again, also referred to in
that relatively lengthy statement, which I have referred to, in the police
disclosure at D119 and following.� 

 

23.          
It is very clear on the
evidence that Mr. C has some mental health issues, the exact nature of which,
it has to be said, are not entirely clear. He appears to have been receiving
treatment from medical professionals in relation to some mental health issues,
and also to compound and/or exacerbate that problem he has a significant issue
with over consumption of alcohol.� It is very apparent, and I accept the
evidence of the mother, Mr. J and Mr. H, that the father, whilst the parties
were together, was in the habit of drinking to excess several times a week to
the extent whereby his functioning was significantly inhibited, slurring and
being unsteady on his feet, and which resulted in him becoming verbally
unpleasant on almost every occasion, as described by the witnesses.� 

 

24.          
I find, particularly in
the context of the other allegations, that it is entirely credible that when in
drink he did throw a glass at the mother�s head, as she alleges in allegation
number 3.� He is clearly capable of dis-inhibited violent behaviour when in
drink, and he has been in drink on a very regular and extremely frequent
basis.� I accept the evidence supports a finding that in 2007, whilst she was
pregnant, he threw a glass at the mother after he had been drinking.� 

 

25.          
Allegation number 4 is
that in 2008 he head butted the mother, knocking her across the room, because
she had taken longer in running an errand than he was content with.� That is
set out at para.5 of her statement at B2.� It is denied by the father in his statement,
but she repeats the allegation in some greater detail in the lengthy witness
statement at p.D120 in the police disclosure.� For all the reasons which I have
already set out, it seems to me, once again, that this is an allegation which
is entirely in keeping with the general picture.� I have already indicated that
I found the mother�s evidence to be impressive, and I accept her evidence on
this.� I am entirely satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the
evidence before me supports the conclusion that the allegation contained at
item 4 in the schedule is indeed one upon which the court can make a proper
finding.� 

 

26.          
Allegation number 5 is
that in August 2008 he threw his mobile phone at the mother causing her a black
eye.� The father deals with that in his own statement, para.6 on p.B11.� He
suggests that on his 40th birthday there had been a party, there had
been a certain amount of drinking amongst those present, and he was woken by the
mother, who had come to bed after he had. She was shouting, he says, and she
slapped him, and he told her, he says, to �Fuck off� and threw his phone which
bounced off a unit and hit her on the top of her forehead leaving an instant
bruise.� He then maintains that he apologised but she left the property.� 

 

27.          
The mother�s version of
events is that she went to check on him, wondering if he was okay following him
going to bed rather the worse for drink after his BBQ for his 40th
birthday, and he was angry and threw his telephone.� As I have said, in her
evidence in the witness box she accepted that he might not have deliberately
intended to hit her with the phone but it did in fact hit her.� It might have
been an accident, he was drunk, he did that a lot when he was angry, and she
suffered an injury. I am entirely content, on the evidence, to accept the
mother�s version of events.� It seems to me that, once again, it fits the
pattern very well, he drinks too much, he goes to bed, his mood is (a)
dis-inhibited, and (b) unpleasant, and when disturbed he lashes out.� Far from
the mother provoking him, he threw the phone careless as to whether or not it
hit her, and in fact it did strike her causing her an injury. 

 

28.          
The next allegation is
that in 2010 he slapped her following a confrontation over an allegation that
he had been having an affair with her sister.� This is contained in the police
disclosure.� The father, in his statement, denies the incident occurred, and,
secondarily, denies that he had ever had an affair with the mother�s sister.�
The mother tells me in the witness box that although she denied it at the time
her sister has subsequently admitted that they had had a brief liaison, she and
Mr. C.� Again, I accept the mother�s evidence on that.� I have given a number
of reasons why I prefer the mother�s evidence where it contradicts the
father�s.� It seems to fit the pattern.� As it turns out, I can quite see him
reacting in the way that the mother suggests to being confronted with his
wrongdoing, and I accept her evidence that in 2010, following an argument about
his liaison with her sister, he slapped her.� 

 

29.          
Allegation number 7 is
that in February 2012 he pushed the mother, again when drunk, when she went to
comfort the daughter, C, who was in the father�s company.� This incident also
encompasses the allegations made against the father of an assault on his own
daughter, E.� E was then, I think, 17, and the child, as I say, of a
relationship prior to the relationships with the mothers of either of the sets
of the rest of the children.� 

 

30.          
E has made a statement
to the police for the purposes of prosecution, that appears at p.D65, and I,
parenthetically, point out that E has also made a statement in the course of
these proceedings supportive of her father in an attempt, I think, among other
things, to explain the injuries to the small child, D, and exculpate the
father.� So in the context of these proceedings, E has, at least in theory,
thrown her hat into the father�s side of the ring.� But in the context of this
allegation she made a statement to the police which founded a potential
prosecution.� 

 

31.          
In the statement at D65
of the bundle, talking of the father, she says: 

 

�I would say he drinks heavily when he goes out, which is usually two or
three times a month.� When he does drink he becomes aggressive, loud, and
sometimes physical.� At about quarter-to-one in the morning on Saturday 11th
February he came in through the back door.�

 

She said that she was on the sofa with her boyfriend. She said: 

 

�I would say he was drunk as I could smell alcohol on him and because
of his behaviour.�� 

 

The mother, it appears, was not present.� She says that he went
upstairs and she heard D crying so she went upstairs to check but Mr. C told
her to go away.� She says she went back downstairs to answer the front door and
let R, the mother, in.� This was around 1 o�clock in the morning.� She says: 

 

�R went straight upstairs.� I ran upstairs a few minutes later and
heard R say something like: �Get off me�.� I could see P holding C in his right
arm and pushing R away with his left hand.� R was standing in the bedroom
doorway at this point until P pushed her out of the room and slammed the door
shut.� I then opened his bedroom door.� D was now laying on the bed.� He swung
his left hand towards me with a clenched fist trying to hit me with his fist.�
He then slammed the door shut, which slammed against my right hand causing
pain.� The whole situation has left me really upset and scared of P.��� 

 

32.          
That was a statement
made by her on 11th February 2012.� There is a further statement
made by her, which does not appear to be dated, but clearly follows it (p.D67
of the bundle) in which she says that whilst she accepts that the original
statement, from which I have just read extracts, was factual she says this: 

 

�During the incident I described my dad was drunk and the way he was
acting frightened me.� I love my dad and all I really wanted was for him to
come back again when he was sober and normal.� He has recently got a job and I
know how much that means to him and how this might affect his future.�� 

 

She then goes on to say that she wants to discontinue her allegation.�
The description given by E in her police statement supports very closely the
mother�s description of the incident.� 

 

33.          
The father, however, in
his statement describes the situation thus (para.17 on p.B14).� He says in 2011
they were drinking at his sister�s house.� He had had enough and wanted to go
home.� The applicant stayed.� He says she later returned and came into the
bedroom, he having gone home and gone to bed.� He says:� 

 

�I told her to leave me alone.� She was drunk again and she was trying
to pick the baby up.� I got up and put the baby back in her cot.� The applicant
walked out and I returned to bed.� Then the baby woke.� I picked the baby up
and as I was getting back in my bed my daughter, E, opened the door.� I was not
dressed so I quickly slammed the door and it accidentally trapped E�s hand.� I
went back to bed and was woken by two police officers who arrested me.� I
received a caution and a fine.� I pleaded guilty to avoid E having to go to
court.�

 

34.          
I am quite satisfied,
on the evidence, that the father�s version of those events is completely
untruthful.� The description given by E conforms with the mother�s description,
broadly speaking, and bears no relation whatsoever to the relatively
exculpatory version given by the father.� He clearly is not in a position to
deny some kind of an assault because he was convicted.� However, his version of
events is clearly untruthful in his statement at B14, and that is certainly one
factor which I take into account generally when assessing his evidence.� Objectively,
the evidence before me, in particular from E, who theoretically supports him in
these proceedings, clearly points to the fact that he is not telling the
truth.� I accept the mother�s version of events, that the father was, once
again, drunk, behaving badly, clearly involving the child, C, and assaulting
both the mother and E on that occasion.

 

35.          
The next allegation is
that contained at number 8.� On 7th July 2013 the father, once again
drunk, took umbrage at the end of an evening involving the neighbours, both Mr.
J and Mr. H being present.� He became unpleasant, partly consequent on having
drunk too much, and having taken umbrage for some unexplained reason, he threw
a garden chair through the conservatory window, smashing it, leaving broken
glass everywhere, being insulting and unpleasant, and ultimately pushing the
mother into the glass on the floor, mercifully not causing her any significant
injury.� He threatened Mr. H and he threatened the mother.� 

 

36.          
The father suggests in
his statement that far from throwing the chair through the window he punched
the window and it shattered.� He describes it in apparently anodyne terms.� He
maintains that he was upset because he found Mr. H and the applicant cuddling
in the conservatory, and it was that which prompted his irritation.� He threw
the garden chair, he says on one occasion, that did not break the window, he
then punched the window and that did break the window.� He said nobody was
injured, he went back to bed, and nothing further occurred.� 

 

37.          
That is completely at
variance with the version of events provided both by Mr. J and by Mr. H, and
further, of course, by the mother�s version of events.� Mr. J and Mr. H both
support the mother�s version.� I should say that the father�s version is that
Mr. J had already left by the time the window was broken, and that clearly is
not the case on Mr. J�s own evidence.� The father�s recollection is clearly, at
the very least, in error, and, in my judgment, is frankly untrue.� He was, as I
accept from the evidence of the mother, Mr. J and Mr. H, drunk and unpleasant
once again, he took umbrage for some unexplained reason, and he became
extremely violent, throwing a garden chair through the window, not injuring
anybody more by luck than good judgment, and subsequently threatened both Mr. H
and the mother.� 

 

38.          
It is not clear to me
whether the children were in the house at the time.� I suspect they probably
were.� Whatever else, this incident clearly was one which the children might
well have witnessed.� There is certainly no evidence that the father took any
steps to ensure that they did not.� Had they witnessed it, it would have been
extremely concerning and disturbing, probably traumatic, for them.� I should
say that there is no evidence before me on any of the statements, even the
father�s, that these incidents of violence in which he was involved, and to
some extent he accepts, involved any consideration at all on his part as to the
sensibilities of the children, or any attempt by him to ensure that the children
were not exposed to the level of bad behaviour that was exhibited.� 

 

39.          
The evidence, in my
judgment, very firmly supports a conclusion that the incident on 7th
July 2013, when he broke the conservatory window, occurred as the mother, Mr. J,
and Mr. H described and not as the father described, and I make that finding
accordingly.

 

40.          
Allegation number 9 is
that the father was again drunk in July, accused the mother of having an affair
with Mr. H, attempted to grab her by the throat and hit her in the face. He had
to be restrained by his brother-in-law.� The father denies that.� I accept, for
all the reasons I have already set out, the mother�s evidence in that respect,
and I make the finding as sought in allegation number 9.� 

 

41.          
Allegation number 10 is
that in August 2013 the mother called the police because she felt the father�s
behaviour was likely to escalate.� The police did attend, and the police
records show, among other things, that during the time when the police were
interviewing the mother in relation to alleged domestic abuse the police were
aware that Mr. C attempted to call the mother at least a dozen times whilst
they were speaking to her.� The mother suggests that the father on this
occasion became angry because she had placed some PIN restriction on access to
information contained in her telephone.� I find this allegation proven.� It is
clear that the mother made the allegation to the police contemporaneously.� The
police record of the investigation fits entirely the pattern of this controlling
and abusive individual.� 

 

42.          
Allegation number 11
relates to the injuries to D.� It is highly unfortunate but is apparent from
the documentation before me, despite it's considerable volume, that there is
missing a not insignificant amount of potentially highly relevant information.�
The s.7 report prepared by the Social Services, which appears in section C,
records information in relation to the allegations in respect of A�s injuries,
which were the catalyst for the involvement of the Social Services in the first
place, which must be taken from information from other sources available to the
Social Services which has not been placed in the bundle before me.� 

 

43.          
It is clear, both from
the police reports and from the record of the social worker�s investigations,
that there must be, apart from anything else, some record from the hospital,
and from the doctors, as to what was observed and what explanations were
given.� None of that material is before me, save in the most indirect sense.� 

 

44.          
The indirect sense is
that both the police and the social worker record that the health professionals
took the view at the time that the injuries exhibited by the child in September
2013 were not in accordance with the explanation given by the father.� The child
was found, as is set out on p.C25 in the social worker�s evidence, to have
relatively extensive bruising, and the explanation given was that the child
somehow had either been ejected from or fallen out of her cot.� The health
professionals took the view, quite reasonably it seems to me even on my limited
understanding of what was observed, that the explanation given was unlikely to
explain the extensive injuries which do not appear to be explicable on the
basis of one single incident.� 

 

45.          
The apparent incident
is, however, supported by a statement provided by E, the father�s elder child,
who, supposedly, was present in the room, although asleep, when the alleged
incident occurred, i.e. that D was ejected by one of her siblings from her cot,
or fell out.� The father, apparently, was asleep downstairs.� He suggests that,
hearing the commotion, he went upstairs to discover that the child was
injured.� The children themselves have been questioned, to some extent, by the
social worker, without much further information being provided. It is apparent,
whether or not the father was directly involved, that there were injuries to
this child which he did not take significant steps to have investigated, indeed
he did nothing until the mother appeared the following day to take over the
care of the children. She became concerned in respect of the apparent injuries
and took the child to the hospital where they were recorded and the police and
the Social Services, as a result, were involved.� 

 

46.          
The Social Services� and
police's conclusions, based upon, as I say, medical evidence which I have not
seen, were that these injuries were unexplained.� The police, however, have
taken the view that they cannot pursue the matter further for the purposes of
criminal proceedings as the evidence does not support a conclusion that either E
or Mr. C himself were directly involved in the cause of these injuries.� 

 

47.          
Unfortunately, I do not
think I can come to any firm conclusion as to the cause of the injuries to this
child.� Given the seriousness of such a conclusion, it seems to me the evidence
does not support, on the balance of probabilities, a conclusion that Mr C was
directly responsible for the injuries to this child.� What I think I can
conclude, however, on the basis of the evidence before me, is that the injuries
are currently unexplained, there is no explanation provided which accords with
the extent of the injuries, and that they occurred at a time when Mr. C, the
father, was responsible for the supervision and protection of the children.� At
the very least, as Mr. Simison suggests, the conclusion of the court is that
they result from a failure to supervise the children appropriately, amounting,
clearly, to neglect and resulting in a small child being the victim of not
insignificant injuries.� 

 

48.          
Therefore, it seems to
me that it is open to me, on the balance of probabilities, to conclude that the
injuries to D can be categorised as falling within the ambit of a failure on
Mr. C�s part to exercise proper supervision and to take proper care of the
children whilst he was directly responsible for them. Beyond that, there, as
yet, has not been provided any adequate explanation for the injuries which this
child received.� Furthermore, I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that
Mr. C did not take appropriate action to seek medical advice in relation to the
injuries as swiftly as he should have done. 

 

49.          
The other outstanding
allegations I have already dealt with, 12 and 14.�� They are the subject of
convictions in the Magistrates Court.� 

 

50.          
Accordingly, those are
the findings which I make on the basis of the evidence before me on the balance
of probabilities.� In the circumstances, in the absence of Mr. C and in the
absence of any submissions made on his behalf, and taking into account the
failure of Mr. C to exercise any contact since November, including not sending
the children any wishes or presents either for Christmas or for birthdays which
have occurred in the meantime, that it is appropriate first of all that a
transcript of this judgment should be prepared, that being a necessary and
proportionate charge on applicant mother�s public funding certificate, and, secondarily,
that there should be an order that there be no contact going forward save by
agreement with the mother in accordance with the advice of Essex Social
Services. In due course a copy of the transcript must be served on Essex Social
Services, and appropriately redacted it will be published.

I	INTRODUCTION


THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with three children:  

 
F, a girl born on 5th December 2003, so now aged 10; 
G, a girl born on 6th June 2006, now aged 7; and 
H, a boy, born on 20th May 2013 and now 6 months.
The mother of all three children is B. I hope she will forgive me if I refer to her by shorthand as "the mother".  The father of F is C, the father of G is D and the father of H is E.  

 
The local authority's key social worker is I and the guardian for the three children is J.  Other important individuals within the family are K, the maternal grandmother and L, the maternal aunt, who are currently caring for F and G.

 
This is the local authority's application for a care order in relation to all three children issued on 19th�August 2013.  The local authority's plan for H is that he be placed for adoption and there is a linked application for a placement order for H issued more recently.  

 
The mother opposes the local authority's applications and seeks the return of all three children to her care.  

 
C is content with the local authority's care plan for F.  He currently has limited indirect contact.  He hopes that may, in due course, develop into a more meaningful relationship.  He has filed evidence and he has previously attended and been represented, but given that his position is essentially agreed he has played no part in this final hearing.  

 
D seeks contact to G, although he does not press the application for direct contact at this stage pending resolution of the linked criminal proceedings. He too has played a full part in these proceedings and has been represented by solicitors and counsel.  

 
Similarly E has been fully involved.  He positively supports the local authority's applications in relation to H.  

 
J wholeheartedly supports the local authority's applications in relation to H.  She agrees that F and G cannot return to the care of their mother, but has suggested that it may be too early to make final care orders.

 
The proceedings commenced as a result of H's presentation to the accident and emergency unit of Hospital A in the early hours of 4th August 2013 with serious injuries.  He was then ten weeks old, six weeks gestational age corrected for prematurity. 

 
My first task is to address the issues arising from those injuries along with other factual evidence relevant to the threshold criteria.  I must then go on to consider the other evidence concerning the welfare of the children and whether to grant the orders sought by the local authority. 

 
I have read all of the documents contained in the main bundle at least once, many several times.  I have been referred to the two lever arch files of medical records as necessary.  I have read the police interviews.  Where witnesses have not been the subject of challenge and have not given oral evidence I have taken their written evidence as read.  In an already over long judgment I do not propose to recite all of the written or, indeed, oral evidence.

 
Over four days, albeit interrupted, commencing on 10th February 2014, I heard oral evidence from:  

 
(a) the mother; 
(b) M, a family friend; 
(c) D; 
(d) L, the mother's sister; 
(e) I, the key social worker; and 
(f) J, the guardian.  
At the conclusion of the evidence and oral submissions on 13th February, given the obvious need for the parties to know the outcome urgently, I indicated my intention to grant the orders sought by the local authority in relation to H and to maintain the placement of F and G within their maternal family.  Pressure of other work meant I was not at that stage able to give full reasons for my decision and today is the first opportunity convenient for all the parties for me to do so.
II	THE AGREED BACKGROUND
The mother is now some 32 years of age.  She appears to have had a very difficult and unstable life with a series of adult relationships which have ended very unhappily.  The local authority's final statement, for instance, reveals 12 different moves since F's birth and prior to H's hospitalisation.  

 
F was born as a result of the mother's relationship with C.  There was a brief period between August 2009 and May 2010 when they cohabited. Thereafter there has been no direct contact between F and her father.  

 
The mother then entered into a relationship with D, at that stage a married man who was her karate teacher.  The relationship ended in acrimonious circumstances around the time of G's birth.  D had no contact with his daughter until 2013.  

 
The mother then entered into a relationship with E and moved in to live with him in about July 2011.  At that time, following care proceedings, he had been approved as the carer for four children, N, O, P, Q, who now range in age from 16 to 7.  N is not his child but the daughter of R, his former partner.  For completeness, another of R's children, S, lives with her paternal grandparents but has visiting contact with her siblings.  That relationship broke down, again amid considerable unpleasantness, in early 2013 when the mother was pregnant with H.  Given E's stance in relation to these proceedings it is neither necessary nor proportionate for me to investigate or make findings in relation to the many allegations made by the mother against E.

 
At that stage the mother, along with F and G, returned to live with the maternal grandmother, K, and her sister, L.  By around March or April 2013 the mother arranged for the girls to have karate lessons with D.  By April she had resumed her relationship with him.

 
When H was born, some weeks prematurely, on 20th May 2013 the position was that D would visit the home of the maternal family on several days each week.  The mother and the three children would also stay at the mother's flat each weekend, D arriving around lunchtime on Saturday and staying until around lunchtime on Sunday.  

 
On Sunday 4th August 2013, in the early hours of the morning, H was presented to accident and emergency with serious head injuries.  Both the mother and D were interviewed by the police on 6th August.  They both remain on police bail and it appears that no charging decisions have yet been reached by the Crown Prosecution Service.

 
The local authority was notified.  H was subsequently accommodated under section 20 and placed with foster carers, where he remains.  F and G were placed in the care of the maternal family where, of course, they were already living for much of the week and where they remain.  The mother and D continued their relationship, living together at the mother's flat.

 
The matter came before me on 4th September 2013.  At that hearing the mother and D were presenting as a couple and sought to be assessed as such.  Given the weight of the medical evidence and the entirely proper concessions at that stage that if the injuries were indeed inflicted, only the mother and D fell within the pool of potential perpetrators, it was agreed that a separate fact finding hearing was unnecessary and the matter was timetabled to an issues resolution hearing in January 2014.  

 
However, in late September 2013 H was readmitted to hospital.  At a hearing on 8th November 2013, concerned that the developing medical evidence was becoming growing increasingly complex and pursuant to a recommendation to that effect from Dr Sarah Dixon, Consultant Paediatrician, I authorised the instruction of Dr. Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neurosurgeon, to review the medical evidence.  He reported promptly and has subsequently answered a number of questions put to him by the parties.  

 
At that November hearing the mother and D purported to have separated, although they now concede that the relationship was actually still continuing and that they were attempting to deceive the court.  In the event, the mother subsequently learned that D had commenced a relationship with one of her friends and on 3rd December 2013 he brought the relationship to an end.  

 
On 5th�December the mother filed a statement which, among other things, describes her having "flashbacks" of seeing D shaking H.  

 
By the date of the next hearing on 8th�January 2014 the mother also contended that at the time of the injuries she was taking an antidepressant drug called Citalopram, which had been incorrectly prescribed.  At her request I approved the instruction of Dr. P.M Haddad, consultant psychiatrist, to provide expert assistance as to the potential for the mother's behaviour and memory to have been affected by an over-prescription of Citalopram.

 
Alongside the investigation of the medical issues in relation to H, the local authority key social worker has conducted assessments of each of the parents.  In parallel, the Family Placement Team has assessed the placement of F and G.  They have also assessed the mother's sister, W, and her husband Y, as potential carers for H, and finally X, the paternal half-sibling, has been assessed as a potential carer for F and G.

 
Sadly, the assessment of the mother's sister, W, and her husband, has proved negative.  I have received a letter from W which is undated but informs me that she has appealed against the local authority's decision as she puts it, not to accept her application, "to look after my nephew, H."  However, the assessment has not been challenged before me. I am satisfied that W has been advised by the local authority, by the guardian and by the mother's solicitors that it was open to her to make an appropriate application to the court should she choose to do so. I must confess my surprise that W has chosen to pursue a process of appeal by way of some internal local authority procedure rather than applying to the court.  In the circumstances I have re-read the assessment, albeit it remains unchallenged, with greater care than I might otherwise have done.  I have also heard evidence from the guardian on the issue. She, following her own discussions with W and Y, concluded that this was not a viable potential placement.

 
F and G appear happy and settled with their grandmother and aunt, although the local authority still has some anxieties as to the quality of the care which they are receiving. I will turn to the relevant assessments later in the course of this judgment 

 
H seems to have made a reasonable recovery from his injuries, although inevitably the prognosis for his future development remains guarded.  

 
III	THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
I remind myself that the burden lies on the local authority to prove the allegations which it makes.  The Supreme Court has clarified the position in Re: H & R [1996] 1 FLR 80.  The appropriate standard of proof is the civil standard of the simple balance of probabilities.  I have reminded myself of Re: B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35 and particularly the speech of Baroness Hale.

 
It is not disputed that H has sustained some injury.  The questions for me to determine are: 

 
(a)	What injuries has he sustained? 
(b)	Were those injuries sustained accidentally or were they inflicted, or is their cause unascertained; 
(c)	If the injuries were inflicted by whom were they caused? 
(d)	If they were not inflicted by the mother has she failed to protect H from sustaining harm?
My approach must be to consider who falls within the band of potential perpetrators of any injury to the child.  I must exclude those individuals where there is "no real possibility that they have caused any injury."  That is the degree of heightened cogency referred to in North Yorkshire County Council v SA [2003] 2 FLR 849.  Thereafter I am conscious that were I able to identify the individual who is responsible for the injuries to H that may be very helpful in terms of reaching decisions as to the welfare of all of the children and it may also be important to H himself in later life.  

 
However, a finding as to perpetrator is not a necessary element of the threshold criteria.  I approach the matter on the basis of the judgment of Lord Justice Wall, as he then was, in the Court of Appeal in Re: D (Care Proceedings, Preliminary Hearing) [2009] 2 FLR 668 at paragraph 12.  

 
If I am satisfied that the mother is not the perpetrator of injury I must consider whether she has failed to protect H.

 
It is not disputed that the threshold criteria at section 31 of the Children Act is established in relation to each of the children, but the factual basis underlying that concession is not agreed. 

 
My starting point in addressing the alternative options for the future of each of the children must be that the best place for any child is with a parent or in default with a member of the extended family unless there are strong welfare grounds to prefer an alternative.  

 
It is trite law that I must be satisfied that any orders I make are a lawful, necessary, proportionate and reasonable response to the children's sad predicament.  The granting of a care order, let alone endorsing a plan for adoption in H's case, would represent a drastic curtailment of the rights of this mother, of these fathers and of these children under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which can only be justified by pressing concerns for their welfare.

 
In relation to F and G there has properly been no suggestion that the girls should be placed separately.  The alternatives which I must address are whether they should return to the care of their mother or whether they should remain placed with their maternal grandmother and aunt.  The issue is complicated by the fact that the local authority has not yet approved the relative carers as long term foster carers and there is a risk that they may decline to do so.  In addressing those issues I have reminded myself of the provisions of section one of the Children Act 1989, the paramountcy of the children's welfare individually and collectively, addressing me to the welfare checklist at section 1(3).  

 
If I decide that the girls should stay with their grandmother and aunt I must also consider whether it would be premature to grant final care orders as proposed by the local authority or whether the position should be monitored under interim care orders for a period.

 
For H, there are three potential options for his future:  a return to the care of his mother, adoption, or, less realistically, remaining with his current foster carers.  Once again in weighing the placement options and considering the local authority's care plan H's welfare must be my paramount concern and I must address the provisions of the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of the Children Act 1989.  

 
Turning to the application for a placement order, again H's welfare remains my paramount concern and in this context I must consider his welfare throughout his life and apply the provisions of the welfare checklist at section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  

 
If I were to conclude that a placement order accords with H's welfare I would then have to decide whether his welfare required me to dispense with the consent of his mother to the making of such an order, his father having consented.  

 
I have already referred to the established principles of Article 8.  However, in construing both the Convention and domestic law I now have the assistance of the Supreme Court in Re: B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33 followed by the decisions of the Court of Appeal particularly in Re: P (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 963 and Re: G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965.  Those cases firmly re-emphasise that a placement for adoption is "a very extreme thing" and "a last resort" to be approved only when "nothing else will do".  Both domestic and Convention law do require a high degree of justification before adoption can be endorsed as "necessary", the term in the Convention, or "required" by the Adoption and Children Act.

 
IV	MY ASSESSMENT OF THE WITNESSES
On the whole, the mother gave her evidence calmly and without a great deal of emotion.  She is clearly an intelligent and articulate woman.  Her presentation was unusual.  When asked a simple question she tended to go off on a tangent and this was particularly marked when her account was challenged.  It is perhaps a small point and one to which I do not attach much weight beyond noting it, but I was struck by the fact that she rarely called her children by their names, referring to them as "my son" or "my daughter".  Sadly, I have been driven to the conclusion that I cannot place safe reliance on the reliability or the honesty of the mother's evidence.  I found her description of the "flashbacks", which emerged in December of last year, particularly implausible.  

 
None of the parties now suggest that M is a reliable historian.  I can place only limited reliance upon her evidence.

 
D gave his evidence well.  Broadly, he appeared straightforward, open and answered questions directly and properly.  It is not the manner in which he gave his evidence which gives rise to any concerns at all.  It is the content of that evidence which, I have ultimately been driven to conclude, cannot be accurate.  

 
I was impressed by L.  She seemed to me to be a sensible and caring woman.  Even bearing in mind that her instincts will inevitably be to support her sister I thought she strove to be honest.  Her evidence is not subject to substantial challenge and I accept it without any real reservation.

 
The key social worker, I, and the CAFCASS guardian, J, are experienced professionals who gave their evidence thoughtfully and with appropriate care and moderation.  I accept that they are each doing their honest best to assist the court, that they have analysed the issues with care and that they have expressed their written and oral evidence clearly.  I can safely rely on their advice and wisdom.

 
V	MY FINDINGS
H's Injuries
In reaching my decisions upon the medical issues in relation to H I have relied upon the following reports which have not been challenged: 

 
(a)	Dr. Sarah Dixon, consultant paediatrician, dated 9th August 2013, with an addendum on 20th October 2013 and her comments upon Dr Richards report dated 3rd February 2014; 
(b)	Dr. Peter Richards consultant paediatric neurosurgeon, dated 18th December 2013 and his subsequent responses to questions posed by the parties; 
(c)	Mr. Roberto Ramirez consultant paediatric neurosurgeon, dated 4th December 2013.  
There is no dissent between those doctors, all of some eminence in their respective fields.  I accept their opinion and advice without any real reservation.
(d)	In relation to the mother I have the assistance of the reports of a number of doctors from her GP practice, but particularly those dated 31st October 2013 and 2nd�January�2014, along with the report of 
(e)	Dr. Haddad, consultant psychiatrist, dated 28th�January�2014.  
Again that evidence is unchallenged and again I accept it.
I bear in mind Miss A's submission that I must place the medical evidence in the context of the whole of the case, what is commonly described as "the broader canvas", and that it is theoretically open to me to reach a conclusion which does not accord with the medical evidence.  

 
(a)  What injuries has H sustained?  
	In the morning of 4th August H was presented in a state of acute collapse and with a history of him having stopped breathing.  In more technical terms he had mild to moderate encephalopathy.  He was subsequently transferred to Hospital B under the specialist care of the neurosurgery team and Dr. Dixon.

 
	CT scanning on 4th August and subsequent MRI scanning revealed that H had a bilateral acute subdural haemorrhage.  

 
In addition there were bilateral chronic subdural haemorrhages which were older, at least seven days older, than the acute haemorrhage.  There were other small abnormalities present in the brain consistent with, but not probative of, trauma.  

 
H suffered from raised intracranial pressure.  His head was swollen.  He was fractious, not inclined to movement.  He had episodes of vomiting, and poor feeding to the extent he required feeding through a nasogastric tube.  

 
	Retinal haemorrhages "too many to count" were observed on H's admission.  On 6th August he was examined by a consultant ophthalmological surgeon, Miss Gajdosova.   In the right eye she observed and recorded multiple multilayered diffuse retinal haemorrhages.  In the left eye there were four scattered retinal haemorrhages.

 
H was discharged to foster care. On 16th September 2013 he was readmitted to Hospital B with a re-bleed into the existing subdural haemorrhage.  He required surgical aspiration via a burr hole and he was detained in hospital, this time for nearly a month.  For a time he was again very poorly indeed.  Such a re-bleed is a recognised complication of an acute subdural haematoma and does not affect the initial diagnosis.

 
I propose to take the next two questions together.  
(b)  	Were those injuries sustained accidentally or were they inflicted, or is their cause unascertained?  
(c)  If the injuries were inflicted by whom were they caused?
I will address the acute injures first.
The clear conclusion of Dr. Dixon, confirmed by Dr Richards, is that in a non-mobile baby, the presence of encephalopathy, together with both retinal and subdural haemorrhages, in the absence of any identifiable accidental trauma is strongly suggestive of inflicted head trauma, probably by the mechanism of shaking. Referring to the "acute" presentation, the position is graphically put by Dr. Richards at E91:  

 
"The clinical picture of a mild to moderate encephalopathy of sudden onset, subdural and subarachnoid bleeding and retinal haemorrhages in the absence of any identifiable medical conditions are features known to be associated with recent injury.  H's presentation on 4th August 2013 could therefore be associated with an episode of recent injury.  The only plausible alternative diagnosis that would explain the whole clinical presentation was that he was suffering from a disease that was previously unknown to the medical profession and whose nature has not been determined since."
At E92, he continues, describing the presentation as one that can follow injuries inflicted by a carer shaking the child and opining:  

 
"The minimum force required to cause such injuries is not known as infants cannot be experimented upon. But on the basis of confessions from perpetrators many clinicians who care for acutely ill infants consider that the degree of force would be in excess of normal handling and at a level such that a mentally competent witness is likely to appreciate it as abnormal handling likely to cause injury and intervene to stop it.  However, it is also accepted that in the absence of any features of severe extracranial injury, such as fractures and bruises, or features of repeated systematic abuse, that many such events occur during a momentary loss of control on the part of a carer who had not planned to injure the child.  H's presentation would be compatible with such an event." 
In relation to this injury it has not been contended that there are, realistically, any potential perpetrators "in the pool" other than the mother and D.  For the avoidance of any doubt whatsoever I record that there is no evidence at all which might point to either F or G having caused this injury.

 
On the accounts of both the mother and D, H was his usual self during 3rd August.  They both gave a similar account of D arriving at around 1pm, of him changing and feeding H before they all set off for a family party at the home of the mother's aunt.  It was a sunny day and for much of the afternoon H was asleep in the garden in his pushchair.  He woke on occasions and was fed.  Other family members were on hand.  The event was enjoyable and H's behaviour entirely normal.  He was described by D as "perfectly fine" and content.

 
	The mother, D and the girls then returned to the mother's flat at around 8pm.  The mother went out briefly to pay for electricity.  When she returned she told me that H was asleep on a sloping chair and the girls were playing on their Wii.  Subsequently the girls went to bed and both the mother and D then recall watching a film. H woke.  He was fed by D.  There was no difficulty in him taking his bottle and D changed him.  The mother gave him a kiss and put him back down to sleep on the chair.  By then she was very tired and went to bed at around 11 o'clock kissing H and D as she left.

 
	D says that around 1.30am he was ready for bed himself and decided to wake H for a feed and to change him before he went to bed.  He says he picked H up.  H was immediately "floppy".  He tried for some 30 to 40 seconds to revive him before calling the mother.  He had to call her twice.  When she arrived in the living room he told her to call 999 and she did so.  Paramedics arrived very quickly, followed by an ambulance and H was taken to Hospital A.

 
That account is entirely reflected in the mother's early statements and police interviews.  However, immediately following the breakdown of her relationship with the father on 5th December 2013 she filed a statement wherein she adds two important details.  Firstly, she says that she heard H giving a high pitched scream just before she heard D call her.  Secondly, that when she went into the room she observed D shaking H from side to side and hitting him.  Those new elements of the account are denied by D and I reject them as fictitious for reasons which I will set out in due course.

 
Putting aside those later embellishments, basically the court is left with D's own account, confirmed by the mother, set in the context of  the medical evidence.  D is quite clear that H was fine at the stage when the mother went to bed.  He had taken his bottle and was well.  By the time of the 999 call he was in a state of collapse and had certainly sustained injury.  D was the only person present at the point when H must have collapsed. 

 
	To quote from Dr. Dixon:  

 
"The finding of the acute subdural haemorrhage correlates to the history of H being seen to be well at 22.30 hours and becoming acutely unwell in the early hours of 4th August.  The most likely timing for causation of the acute subdural haematoma is immediately prior to his collapse."
Dr. Richards concurs:  

 
"Given that there is a clear history of him being normal in terms of behaviour up until the point of his acute collapse it is likely on the balance of probabilities that the point of change from normality to abnormality was the point of injury."
	There is some very limited supporting evidence pointing to D as a perpetrator of H's acute injures alongside his own account and the medical evidence. I am cautious about placing excessive weight upon such flimsy foundations but I record the following matters of detail: 

 
(a) D accepts that he told L that he had indeed "shaken H".  He told her that at a bus stop outside the hospital.  He went on to give her, and subsequently the court, a demonstration which he described as "jiggling" the baby.  This "jiggling" process is insufficiently vigorous to have caused H's injuries, but the very fact that he told L that he had "shaken H" is worrying.  
(b) I note that D, like the mother, has been prepared to lie to the court and the local authority in an effort to present their relationship as having ended by the time of the hearing in November when they were still, very much, a couple.  
(c) In his statement to the police, to the court and in oral evidence D said that nothing untoward had happened whilst the mother was out paying the electricity and that in fact H was asleep throughout.  However, on 4th December at a contact session observed by BB,  F said that, whilst her mother was out of the flat: 
"H had poohed himself, it had gone all over his back, D had stripped him and put him in the sink and washed him, slapped his bottom and H was screaming."
I also note that the mother, contrary to the evidence she gave before me, told Dr. Dixon that when she returned from paying the electricity, F was crying in the corner and G was having a tantrum. 
I was suspicious about what F said because I am quite clear that words have previously been put in her mouth by her mother.  Nevertheless, when her account was suggested to him in evidence, D accepted that he had indeed needed to change and wash H in the sink and that he had simply forgotten to include that incident in any previous account of matters.  Reminding myself that people do lie for all sorts of reasons, some of them unconnected with guilt, I am, just, persuaded that he deliberately failed to mention that incident because he knew it did not cast him in a good light.
While I am dealing with the conversation on 4th December, I am unimpressed with `the mother's attempt to over egg that particular pudding by suggesting that F had also given an account of observing D shaking H some time before the 999 call.  There is no record of that in the contact officer's notes and F was  completely bewildered as to what she is "supposed" to be saying when she was later interviewed by Miss Harrison and in her ABE interview.	 

 
As Miss A submits on his behalf it is indeed ironic that the most damaging evidence against D is his own. I have also to bear in mind that he has successfully brought up a daughter and has a good relationship with his grandchild, he has worked as a karate instructor with children for many years and there is no evidence of any inappropriate behaviour in the whole of his history. Although H is not his child I have a very clear impression that he was very fond of H.  He was present at his birth and was willing to participate in his care.  In those circumstances, I have genuinely racked my brains to see if there could be any alternative explanation.  

 
	What, then, is the evidence which might point to the mother as the perpetrator of H's injuries?  I begin with the constellation of factors which she accepted had taken her to a point of total exhaustion by August 2013.  

 
a.	Two lively and demanding daughters to care for, 
b.	School holidays 
c.	A premature baby who woke repeatedly in the night to be fed, 
d.	The aftermath of the breakdown of her relationship with E, 
e.	Her depression and 
f.	What I judge to be her general lack of effective coping mechanisms.  
In summary, the mother was having real problems in managing life with three children on a day to day level. Sadly, as she concedes, she has significant psychological difficulties which must to be addressed. These are the type of stressful factors which might result in a parent momentarily losing control with a crying baby. 
	The mother is now clear in her evidence that she certainly did not injure H, that there is no occasion when she shook him and that she would have remembered if she had done so. However, the fact is that she had previously been willing to hypothesise that she might indeed have caused H's injuries while under the influence of prescribed medication. That very fact does give rise to anxiety.  I note that this suggestion first arose in discussions with the social worker when the mother remained in a relationship with D. I fear she may have been trying to protect him.  However, the suggestion was elaborated upon at the hearing in January 2014 after they had separated when the issues around her medication arose. 

 
I am satisfied that, in error, the mother's GP gave her two prescriptions for Citalopram an antidepressant, at 80 milligrams per day instead of the intended dose of 40 milligrams per day.  Those prescriptions were issued on 20th�June 2013 and 5th August 2013. The error was corrected on 29th August 2013.  I accept the unchallenged evidence of Dr. Haddad that the approved dose of Citalopram for healthy adults is currently 40 milligrams per day.  In the comparatively recent past the approved dose was 60 milligrams per day.  Dr. Haddad would not anticipate that a patient would experience significant serotonin toxicity at 80 milligrams per day and the risk of side effects would be reduced if the patient had already taken Citalopram without adverse effects, as the mother had done for a considerable period.  Dr. Haddad anticipated that if a patient did develop any side effects of the medication they would be mild but might typically include agitation, tremor and a fast heart rate.  Side effects would not normally include symptoms such as confusion or memory impairment.

 
It is theoretically possible that if the mother was also taking Tramadol, which she had also been prescribed alongside Citalopram, the two drugs could have combined with a side effect which might have included a degree of confusion.  

 
I have reached the conclusion that the mother's willingness to concede that she might have shaken H whilst adversely affected by Citalopram is a "red herring" and simply does not assist me in determining how and by whom  H's injuries were caused.  

 
	The evidence of Dr Haddad in relation to Citalopram is also relevant to my assessment of the veracity of the elaborating details of the mother hearing a scream and seeing H being shaken by D, before the ambulance arrived on 4th August 2013.  I  am not persuaded that she is telling me the truth about either of those details.  It is, in my judgment frankly incredible that B could have forgotten incidents which really occurred only for them to return in the form of a "flashback".  For her to say, as she did in evidence, that when she made her first statements to the police, hospital and court "I did not have a full recollection of the evening" but that, as time has moved on, she "remembers more" is wholly unconvincing.  The mother has given clear and consistent accounts of events on to treating doctors, to the police, to the court, in her statements and in her oral evidence.  Those accounts descend to minute details and are consistent with the version of events presented by D until they separated.  Apart from a momentary lapse during the 999 call when she cannot recall her telephone number there is no evidence of any contemporaneous confusion or inability to recollect events. Hearing her new baby scream or seeing him being shaken are hardly trivial details   which might easily be overlooked by this or any mother

 
I note that this account emerged only after D had left her for another woman.  It is consistent with a pattern of vilification of the fathers of her children when she has fallen out with them. Although, broadly, I am not impressed with the evidence of M I do accept that the mother expressed a desire to wreak vengeance upon D, once she discovered his infidelity.

 
	Although discreditable, I am not persuaded that the mother's lies point to her as perpetrator of H's injuries. Moreover, even if I am wrong in rejecting the mother's evidence of those matters, that actually makes no difference in terms of my analysis of what happened to H.  The scream adds little and, on any account, H had collapsed several minutes before the mother came into the room and hence any injury had already been sustained 

 
	If the mother did shake H without D's knowledge it can only have been earlier in the day,  before D arrived at her flat. After D arrived she was not alone with  H. H was observed to be well and happy during the afternoon and evening thereafter. On the medical evidence the timing of an insult during the morning of 3rd August 2013 is completely wrong.  

 
 	I have, of course, also considered with care the mother's and D's accounts of the various, apparently trivial, incidents which occurred during the course of 3rd August.  There is no evidence that any of those small incidents, if they occurred, caused D more than momentary discomfort.  They were extremely unlikely to have caused injuries of such gravity. On the medical evidence timing is, again,  inapt. 

 
 	Finally, Mr B has suggested that perhaps the mother and D are both lying and D is "taking the blame" for the mother.  D does not strike me as a particularly selfless man.  These are not parents who are still in a continuing relationship. I find that collusion to that degree is vanishingly improbable.  

 
	In conclusion, bearing in mind the father own account, the cogency of the medical evidence and the absence of any realistic alternative scenario, I am satisfied that the injury must have been caused when H was in the sole care of D, that the event causing the injury has not been disclosed to the court and that on the balance of probabilities it was D who inflicted H's acute injuries by shaking him.  

 
The chronic subdural haemorrhage
	I rely again upon the medical evidence and I quote from the report of Mr Richards which accords with the evidence of Dr Dixon :  

 
"There are many causes of acute bleeding that can lead on to the development of chronic subdural haematoma but they are usually readily identifiable by the clinical history and a series of tests.  No such cause has been identified in this case.  Injuries well recognised as a cause of acute subdural bleeding include birth injury, accidental injury or non-accidental injury originating with a shake.  
The event that would cause a chronic subdural haematoma is likely to have occurred some weeks before the haematoma reaches a size where it is detectable and in this case, in terms of timing alone, birth cannot be excluded as a cause of the chronic subdural haematoma identified in August.  However, in the research projects that identify that acute subdural bleeding can occur as a result of birth the least likely method of birth to cause subdural bleeding was caesarean section.  A well recognised cause of acute subdural bleeding leading to chronic subdural haematomas is following an episode of shaking and statistically this has been identified in community based studies as the commonest cause of acute subdural haematomas."
Mr Richards concludes at E95:  
"It is also possible and statistically most likely that at some stage in his life he had suffered an earlier similar [shaking] injury that led to the formation of a chronic subdural haematoma over both cerebral hemispheres, though this cannot be said with certainty as other than the presence of the chronic subdural haematoma there are no other features to support this possibility."
I am satisfied to the appropriate standard that this was also an inflicted injury.  I have noted that both the mother and D had extensive opportunities to cause that injury.  Both would have been alone with him during the relevant period. 

 
	The only realistic alternative to this being an earlier shaking injury is birth trauma.  H would have been very unfortunate indeed to have sustained a statistically unusual injury during a caesarean section only to suffer a completely unconnected shaking injury causing very similar consequences some ten weeks later.

 
 In one sense it is neither necessary nor profitable for me to try to identify the perpetrator of this injury or to try to pinpoint the date for this first trauma given my findings in relation to the acute subdural injury. I do however note that if the measurement of H's head size at eight weeks, that is mid July, is correct then his head size grew from the fifth to the ninety-eighth centile, which certainly suggests that the injury had already been sustained by then.  That is dealt with at E94 by Mr Richards:

 
"I also note that on 30th July H was examined by his General Practitioner because he appeared unwell.  It is apparent from the note at H799 that that was a careful examination.  He was particularly noted to have loose stools but to be generally irritable and unhappy.  That evidence may be consistent with a more recent injury but there is quite a history of H appearing sometimes irritable, difficult to settle, sometimes sleeping more than usual, and sometimes crying with a high pitched scream in the weeks immediately preceding 4th August again consistent with a head injury.
	Having reached the conclusion that this is also an inflicted injury, there is no evidence that anyone other than the mother and D could fall within the pool of potential perpetrators.  The case is unusual as Mr B submits and I have to bear in mind the unfavourable impression I have of the mother's evidence.  But on balance I have concluded that the more likely perpetrator of the injury is D.  I think it is improbable that two different adults caring for H would separately, and apparently unknown to each other, shake him on two separate occasions causing strikingly similar injuries 

 
(d)	 If the injuries were not inflicted by the mother has she failed to protect H from sustaining harm,
The mother accepted in evidence that she had neglected her responsibilities as a mother to the children.  There is no evidence that she delayed in obtaining medical treatment for H but her conduct following H's admission to hospital does her no credit.  She was enthusiastically in favour of being jointly assessed to care for H with D.  She failed to grasp the essential blunt point that if she had not shaken her son he was the only other person who could have done so.  She prioritised that relationship over her children.  She was keen for D to be seen in the best possible light until the relationship broke down when she did not hesitate to vilify him.  

 
	I have not accepted her account of her seeing D shaking H.  Were she to be telling me the truth about that, then her subsequent conduct at the hospital and during these proceedings in failing to reveal what he had done until she had subsequently fallen out with him would have been a failure to protect at the very highest level.

 
The Threshold criteria  - additional findings 
Given the gravity of my findings in relation to H's injuries the other matters which the local authority rely upon assume a reduced significance, although in terms of future planning for the children they are of some importance.  The draft threshold criteria are set out at A7 onwards.  

 
The relevant allegations which are conceded and which I accept are these:  

 
(i)	The observations of the mother preparing a shandy for F, who was then aged 2 years and 6 months, indicating that her General Practitioner advised that that was "all right" and it was also all right for her daughter to drink a half glass of wine.  
(ii) 	That the  mother's emotional and psychological health was fragile.  
(iii) 	The unstable and volatile nature of the mother's relationships with her partners.  
(iv) 	The mother's chaotic lifestyle, which included periods of homelessness and separations and reconciliations with C and D.  
(v)	The volatile nature of the mother's relationship with members of her family and her associates.    
There are other matters that are contended for by the local authority which  are denied by the mother but which, having read the historical documents with care,  I also accept: 
(vi)	That from time to time dating back to 2005, there were poor home conditions within the mother's household and concerns that the children's emotional health and development were being neglected by the mother.  
(vii)	The mother did not address the concerns with Children's Services A and moved to Place Name A in July 2010.
I am satisfied that each of the children has suffered significant harm and that they were likely to suffer significant harm in the future by reason of the care afforded to them, or likely to be afforded to them, by their mother and fathers.

 
The balancing exercise for  H 
The mother has contended for a long term foster placement with H's current carers.  I am satisfied that they are admirable individuals who have offered H an extraordinarily high quality of care and I hope, Miss C that you will ensure that a formal commendation is passed to them from me.  However, they are professional foster carers of considerable experience.  They, themselves, have formed a strong view that H deserves the opportunity of an adoptive placement.  They are not in a position to make a long term commitment to H.  This is not a realistic option.  

 
There are no potential carers within either the maternal or paternal family.  

 
Given that H is still only 9 months old there are only two realistic options which fall for my consideration.  Could he return to his mother's care or must he be placed for adoption?

 
Returning to his mother's care would enable H to grow up with a mother who, despite her deficiencies, does love him very much indeed.  He would be able to enjoy a relationship with his sisters and extended family.  There would be difficulties about any meaningful relationship with his father but at least that possibility would exist.  

 
Balanced against those advantages is the clear evidence that H would be exposed to a continuing risk of really significant physical and emotional harm in his mother's care.  I do not wish to dwell upon these matters because I recognise how painful they are, At present and even with family support, she struggles to lead a stable, balanced  life for herself let alone manage the upbringing of a vulnerable child successfully.  It is through no fault of her own that she has been treated for depression more or less continuously since 2001. Recently, she has begun to attend courses and counselling and I sincerely hope that that will help her. But her problems are of a magnitude that they will not be resolved in a timescale which would enable her to meet H's needs.

 
There is also evidence, I am sorry, to say, of an insensitivity to the emotional needs of her children; the way that all the fathers were cut out of their children's life, the manner in which G was reintroduced to D by simply being taken to his karate class and basically left to get on with it, her unrealistic promises to F and G about them returning home, the lack of emotional warmth. I had no sense from the mother's evidence that she has developed any real understanding of these issues 

 
It is important that I read into this judgment the evidence of E who has reached the heartbreaking decision not to put himself forward to care for H:  

 
"Whilst I love and care for him deeply I accept that to care for him as well as my other children would be a difficult task and I think it would be better for H to have the best start in life that he could possibly have and I think that would be by way of him being placed outside the family in an adoptive placement.  I do not believe that H's needs would best be met by B or by any member of her family."
I note Miss D's submissions on his behalf.  His is not a stance of passive acquiescence but a positive desire to achieve what is best for his son.
On behalf of the Local Authority I has undertaken a careful assessment of the mother and each of the fathers.  Neither she nor J has approached their recommendations lightly.  They have given particular weight to the separation of H from F and G as well as his parents.  

 
I am acutely aware that adoption is no panacea and adopters face all the vicissitudes of life faced by ordinary parents with the added complication that they are caring for a child who is not their birth child.  Adoptions can and do breakdown, sometimes with disastrous consequences.  On the other hand H is still less than one year old.  He should be placed relatively speedily.  The evidence is that there are 100 potential matches for him in Establishment A.  Statistically at least the prospects for successful adoption are very good.

 
	H has had an extraordinarily difficult start to life.  Born prematurely, he has been subjected to two separate serious head injuries suffering pain and distress. He has been removed from his mother, placed with foster carers and then spent a month in hospital as a result of his injuries.  H needs and deserves the opportunity of a safe, stable, secure and permanent family and in my judgment adoption offers not only the best prospect, but the only realistic prospect, of him achieving that.  I accept the evidence of the local authority, the guardian and the father that this is genuinely a case where "nothing else will do" for H.  

 
	The position really is so clear that H's welfare requires me to dispense with the mother's consent to the making of a placement order.

 
	I record my hope that both parents will, if prospective adopters agree, have the opportunity to meet them and that they will contribute to the life story work for their son.  There is no reason why prospective adopters should not be asked if they might be willing to facilitate direct contact between E and H, though that cannot be a requirement of the search and I would not wish to raise unrealistic expectations in E's mind.

 
The balancing exercise for F and G 
I bear in mind that both F and G have expressed the wish to return to the care of the mother and, indeed, were that the court's decision both the grandmother and aunt have expressed their intention to provide her with any support she may require.  Balanced against the obvious advantages of a return to the care of a loving mother is the harm that F and G have both suffered by reason of the level of care which the mother has offered to them and the likelihood of that harm continuing.

 
Until she separated from D the mother was content for F and G to remain in the care of her mother and sister and in her heart of hearts I believe that she acknowledges that that is still where they are indeed best placed. I note the careful way in which Miss E put her submissions, that in "an ideal world" she would like to care for the girls herself.  In her evidence she, herself, acknowledged that she was currently not really in a position to do that. I am satisfied that the best place for them is with their grandmother and aunt.

 
There have however, been problems in that placement.  So that it is clear that I understand the extent of those problems I intend to set them out.  This assessment arises from the work of the Family Placement social worker, CC.  She has not yet been able to recommend to the fostering panel that they be approved as long term foster carers.  On 28th January they were only approved as short term foster carers pending further work and an adjourned panel date in May. The concerns include these:  

 
a.	The receipt of Child Benefit and Tax Credit via the mother, 
b.	Defensiveness of the mother's position in relation to H's injuries, although in the light of my findings their judgment was correct 
c.	A tendency to accept the mother's account of matters without real question and especially her views about her former partners, 
d.	That home conditions are sometimes only just acceptable 
e.	That the property is overcrowded, 
f.	That there are times when the grandmother has appeared very stressed by the assessment process and a couple of occasions when she has complained of feeling exhausted, 
g.	The absence of contingency plans if the aunt formed a relationship and decided to move from her mother's home , 
h.	The reliance upon W, who has not been assessed favourably, to take the children to and sometimes from school, and 
i.	W's and the grandmother's involvement in requests to separate F and G from E's children who attend the same school and with whom they had previously been on friendly terms.  
j.	Finally, and I do attach real importance to this, the wholly inappropriate involvement of the girls, and especially F, in adult conversations and issues and insensitivity to the impact upon both girls of the mother's continuing involvement in the lives of grandmother and aunt .  I had hoped that this was an issue which was diminishing.   I was alarmed to read in I's final statement, at paragraph 10.8, a record of G's conversation with her school pastoral worker, DD: 
"While in nurture group today G said: 'We have to get mummy back.'  I said: 'What do you mean?'  She said: 'When the social worker comes I have to say I want to live with mummy.'  I said:  'Okay, does F need to say anything?'  She said: 'Yes.  She has to say I want to live with mummy.'  I said:  'Who said that you have to say that?'  She said:  'Grandma.'  She went on to say: 'H has been adopted and we will never see him again.'"
These children are confused enough without adults making it worse  
 I have not heard evidence from CC but I do not underestimate the difficulties and I accept that this is not a perfect placement. However, I am concerned that, taken overall, her report presents quite a negative picture and I fear that the very real positives of this placement have not been accentuated.  I understand that the welfare of F and G has  recently been enhanced by a clear working agreement and a better understanding of the real issues, that the family have moved on to some extent and that some optimism for the future is justified 

 
I invited L to be present through the whole of the evidence in this case because I was concerned that she and her mother had an imperfect picture of the circumstances in which F and G came to need their love and support.  I was very encouraged by L's evidence and the observations of the good relationship which has already been developed with the key social worker. I's evidence was this:  

 
"I think the children are best placed where they are right now.  Having had lengthy discussions with L I am convinced that we can work together to overcome the obstacles for the girls remaining with them.  I am happy to say that hearing her evidence she has developed more insight into some of the concerns."
Later in questioning she said it would only be as a drastic last resort that the children would be moved.  I have already expressed the view in discussions with the advocates that the real focus now should be upon the local authority doing everything it can to support and assist this family in undertaking the difficult task they have volunteered for because of their love for F and G.  A repeated process of "assessment" does seem more suited to someone applying to be a professional foster carer than a family member.  
	Unless some dire emergency which would justify an emergency protection order arises, the local authority has agreed that, should they reach the regrettable conclusion that this placement cannot be maintained, they will give the family six weeks' notice before actually moving the girls.  That would enable the matter to be brought back to court and the local authority decision reviewed before any dramatic step is taken.  

 
	I accept that the coming months will be particularly challenging for the children, for the grandmother and aunt, and for the mother, as F and G learn, contrary to the promises they have been made, they are not returning home to their mother and that H is indeed to be placed for adoption.  In that context, there are advantages in the guardian remaining involved to support and assist the children. I appreciate her legitimate anxiety that at this stage she cannot have the degree of confidence or certainty that she would like to have in the sustainability of this placement and the efficacy of the local authority plans to support it.  

 
	However, the only real alternative to my making a final care order today is to adjourn this case until after the date of the fostering panel in May 2014.  Allowing for the filing of further final care plans, responses and the report from the children's guardian the case would not be ready for hearing until June or July, nearly a year after the proceedings commenced.

 
 There are some advantages in the proceedings being concluded today.  It removes the tension and anxiety inherent in everyone having to come back to court and it enables F and G to be given as clear a message as is possible as to their future placement.  

 
However, the real point is that, however it is dressed up, what I am actually being asked to do is to monitor and oversee the implementation of the local authority's care plan.  That is now not a permissible role for the court and I decline to do so.  I must repose confidence in this local authority, its social worker and its independent reviewing officer.  I find the local authority's plans are sufficiently choate for me to approve them and make final care orders in relation to F and G.

 
I am, of course, aware in reaching that decision of L's legitimate concern that if they needed to challenge the local authority's decision making processes they would not qualify for legal aid and would find it extraordinarily difficult to incur the costs of instructing a solicitor.  I propose to reserve the case to myself in any event and L can be entirely confident that she can come and discuss matters with me unaided by a lawyer if that should, sadly, prove necessary.

 
VI	ORDERS 
In relation to  H 
	Recording that I approve the local authority's care plan and with the consent of the father I make a care order.

THE 	JUDGE:  I would like the parties, and particularly the guardian, to give some thought to the hand over to the independent reviewing officer. .  It seems to me the independent reviewing officer will need to see a transcript of my judgment, the guardian's report, the Local Authority final statement and the final care plans?
There are a number of very obvious issues that need to be covered but the issues for the girls are quite complex.  They include the support that is necessary for the placement, the instruction of the psychotherapist, liaison with the girls' schools, the monitoring of contact to the mother, the devising of a very clear working agreement with the carers as to what is and what is not permissible following this order and the various arrangements for contact with the children's parents.  But I have no doubt you can draw up a more thorough list with the assistance of your colleagues
MISS C:	I think so.

JUDGMENT

I am concerned with two children: 

 
A, born on 1st January 2007; and 
B, born on 8th August of 2005.  
The father of both children is C, and their mother D.  There have been protracted proceedings in relation to both children which date back to the father's application for contact to them as long ago as 26th April of 2011.  Those proceedings were commenced in the family proceedings court, subsequently transferred to the county court and notably the children were made party to the application in December of 2011.  

 
By 3rd April 2013, District Judge Haigh had made an order providing for direct contact between the children and their father each Sunday from 11 am till 2 pm.  That contact occurred on a couple of occasions but by 20th of May 2013 the father was already applying to enforce the order of the learned district judge.  

 
Thereafter there was a hearing on 1st�July before District Judge Haigh which the mother did not attend.  That hearing was adjourned.  The mother did attend a hearing on 5th August of 2013.  It was agreed that contact arrangements be altered so that contact occurred between Friday at 6 pm to Saturday at 5 pm, that is overnight staying contact.  

 
A final hearing was listed for November 2013.  However the contact did not take place as directed and the matter came back before District Judge Haigh on 23rd September. The mother did not attend.  Again at the adjourned hearing on 11th October the mother did not attend.  On 22nd November, once more the mother did not attend.  

 
The matter was transferred to the Circuit bench and came before Mr Recorder Murray on 23rd January of 2014. Yet again the mother did not attend.  

 
I am satisfied that upon each of those occasions there were appropriate directions for the mother to attend, generally supported by a penal notice, and that the relevant orders were personally served upon the mother.   The mother having ignored the order for direct contact, there were also repeated applications for enforcement of the order.

 
The learned recorder made a fresh order for direct contact to commence on 1st February 2014 requiring there to be contact basically each Saturday between 4 pm and 7 pm, the handover to be Location A.  He also then adjourned the application to be heard His�Honour�Judge Allweis on 21st February 2014. Appropriate penal notices were attached both to the order for contact and the requirement to attend the hearing before His�Honour�Judge Allweis.  

 
Unsurprisingly, contact did not take place in accordance with the order of the learned recorder. On 4th February 2014 the father in desperation issued an application for the mother's committal to prison and the mother was served with that application on 6th February 2014.  

 
When the matter came before His Honour Judge Allweis on 7th March, the mother attended.  However, she departed from the court building before the matter could be heard.  His Honour Judge Allweis made a 21 day suspended committal order on terms.  The terms were that the mother complied with an order commencing Saturday, 15th March 2014 to take the children, unaccompanied by any other person, to Location A each Saturday at 4 pm and hand them over to C, their father, returning there at 7 pm the same day to collect them from their father.  She was also required to attend the next hearing listed before HHJ Allweis on 4th April 2014.  His Honour Judge Allweis gave a short judgment which has been transcribed and which I have read.  That judgment was duly served upon the mother along with the relevant orders. Contact did not take place.  

 
Unfortunately, on 4th April 2014 His Honour Judge Allweis was not available to hear this case and the matter came before me. The mother did not attend that hearing. However, I was concerned that there was no formal evidence of the alleged breaches of the order.  I adjourned the committal application until today, again requiring the mother to comply with the arrangements for contact between 4 pm and 7 pm each Saturday.    The mother has not attended today. 

 
I have read the affidavit of service.  I am satisfied that the mother has been served with the relevant order requiring her to attend today and to comply with the previous orders of the court in relation to contact.  I am satisfied that the mother has failed to comply with the order of His Honour Judge Allweis of 7th March 2014, in that contact between the children and their father has not taken place at all and the mother has not attended court as directed. Those failures must be seen in the context of the mother's steadfast refusal to comply with previous orders of Recorder Murray and District Judge Haigh.  

 
In particular, notwithstanding the suspended committal order of His Honour Judge Allweis dated 7th March, the mother has not complied with the terms of the order for contact upon which that suspension was predicated.  

 
The only proper interpretation of the mother's conduct is that she has deliberately and repeatedly chosen not to comply with the orders of this court requiring her to facilitate contact between the children and their father. Despite repeated orders of the court these children have not seen their father for  some 9 months.   Nor has the mother attended this court as directed.  She can, in the light of the order of His�Honour�Judge�Allweis, have no doubt as to what the consequences of that failure to comply would be.  

 
It is always a grave step to deprive the mother of two young children of her liberty.  Realistically, however, the only alternative is for this court to acquiesce in the mother's blatant disregard for the orders of this court and to accept that  notwithstanding that previous judges have concluded that contact between the children and their father accords with their welfare interests, the prospect of such contact occurring must be abandoned.  

 
In all of those circumstances, I make an immediate order for the mother to be committed to custody at HM Prison Styal for the period of 21 days ordered by His Honour Judge Allweis.  

 
I reserve any applications in relation to that order to myself or His Honour Judge Allweis, if available or if not or another circuit judge sitting at the Civil Justice Centre

JUDGE MURDOCH:



This is an application by a mother for leave to oppose an application for adoption of her son, F, born in November 2007 and therefore now six years and three months of age.  The mother, as I understand it, was born in February 1991 and so was 16 at the time of F's birth.  I should say that F's father's name appears to be unknown to the local authority and the applicant.  He is in any event not named in F's birth certificate and so he does not have parental responsibility for F.  During the mother's pregnancy with F she met a man, Mr D, who became in due course the father of her two younger children, M, who was born in December 2010 and is now three, and B, who was born in July 2012 and is now therefore 19 months old.  The mother's relationship with that man appears to have resumed in 2009 and he was then living it seems in Holland and the mother left F with her maternal grandmother on a date which is not entirely clear but was probably in 2010.  It was in any event before 10 October 2010, which is the date when F was placed in police protection at a time when the maternal grandmother was arrested together with another relative for attempting to leave the country with F and F's cousin, travelling on false documents.  The grandmother was held in custody pursuant to her arrest on that occasion.  At the time that F was made the subject of police protection he was found to have very serious dental problems and required surgery under general anaesthetic for the removal of eight of his teeth.  He was then not yet three years of age.  At that stage the maternal grandmother told the local authority who received F into their care that the mother was in Germany but in January 2011 she informed them that the mother was in Holland and had given birth to her second child, M.  As I have said, that was in December 2010.  At that stage the information from the grandmother was that the mother had fled from her violent partner, M's father.  The social worker rang a telephone number and spoke to someone who said she was the mother who said that she was trying to get back to the UK from Holland, where she was living illegally.  Apart from the telephone number, no contact details were provided.  

 



The local authority issued care proceedings in respect of F on 1 April 2011 and in those proceedings he was made the subject of a series of interim care orders.  The maternal grandparents told the local authority that they did not know the mother's whereabouts; they assumed she was living in Holland, having, as they understood it, returned to the abusive partner, Mr D.  The local authority then learned that the mother had surrendered to the Dutch authorities and asked to be deported to the United Kingdom and indeed after four months in a Dutch detention centre the mother was returned to the United Kingdom in July 2011.  At that stage her child, M, remained abroad with other carers.  On arrival in this country the mother spent three months in Holloway Prison, not being released from there until September 2011.  She was represented in the care proceedings and attended court hearings on 2 September and on 18 October, the former occasion being while she was still held in custody and the second being after her release.  She explained in a statement filed in those proceedings that she had left F with her mother, intending to return from Holland to visit him regularly but Mr D had been violent to her and she was unable to leave him.  After learning of F's having been taken into care she decided that the only way to return to the United Kingdom was via detention and deportation.  After the hearing in October 2011 the mother returned to the Netherlands.  In doing so she failed to engage in any assessment process within the care proceedings.  The local authority received information from the grandparents, including to the effect that the mother was in a refuge in Germany and then that she was in Cologne with an uncle.  There was a conversation between the mother and the social worker when the mother telephoned and said that she did not agree with the local authority's then plan for F to be placed for adoption and she told the social worker that she was in a refuge in Germany because her partner had been trying to kill her.  She gave no other contact details.  The final hearing in the care proceedings was set for 15 May 2012.  The local authority had sought to serve the latest court order on the mother but had been unable to do so because of the lack of contact details.  The grandparents were in touch with the mother, however, and in a letter dated 11 April 2012 solicitors acting for the maternal grandparents said that the German authorities would be returning the mother to the UK and by another letter dated 13 April the grandparents sought the adjournment of the care proceedings until after the mother had returned to the UK.  Despite that application, the Family Proceedings Court, considering matters at the hearing (which was fixed as a final hearing) on 15 May 2012, decided to proceed with the hearing and made a care order and a placement order in respect of F.  The care proceedings had been in existence for over a year at that stage and F had been in foster care for some 19 months.  

 



Following that hearing the mother returned to the UK at the end of May and she has remained in this country ever since.  She in fact gave birth shortly after her return to the United Kingdom to her third child, B, that birth occurring, as I have said, in July 2012.  She has sought to regularise her immigration status and has been supported by the National Asylum Support Service ("NASS").  M has had a number of carers, being eventually returned to his mother's care in November 2012.  B has been in his mother's care throughout the period since his birth.  In March 2013 when the mother was living in Haringey she permitted Mr D to join her in her home and in that home there was a violent incident when the police were called.  The mother fled with the children to Croydon and stayed in an NASS hostel there until April 2013 when she and the younger two children were re-housed in Birmingham.  The mother has been convicted of an offence of shoplifting and was made subject to a suspended sentence in respect of that matter and was required not to go within a particular exclusion zone locally.  I shall return to that matter a little later.  

 



The mother on returning to the United Kingdom immediately sought advice from Coram Children's Legal Centre in relation firstly to appealing the care and placement order and secondly to seeking contact with F.  The local authority, however, were opposed to the establishment of direct contact, given the orders that had been made in the Family Proceedings Court and the substantial lapse of time since the mother had last seen F.  The mother sought advice from solicitors, who wrote to the local authority in November 2012 asking for direct contact between the mother and F but the local authority responded, indicating that this would not be agreed.  There was then a delay in the mother obtaining funding to apply for contact, which was granted in mid-March 2013.  On 18 April 2013 the mother issued a contact application at the Principal Registry of the Family Division.  There was then some difficulty in the processing of that application and it appears that it was not until some weeks later that Kent County Council became aware that the application had been issued.  On 21 May 2013 the local authority informed the mother's solicitors that an adoptive family had been identified for F and that a panel meeting was scheduled for 4 June.  The local authority at that time continued to maintain its opposition to direct contact.  The panel in due course approved the adoptive match and on 7 June the local authority wrote again to the mother's solicitors saying that the local authority intended to proceed with the plan to place F with the prospective adopters.  A planning meeting was due to take place on 21 June but on the previous day, 20 June, the mother's solicitors had written expressing concern as to the proposal for introductions to start and stating that they intended to issue an application for leave to apply to revoke the placement order.  

 



The matter then came before Her Honour Judge Rowe QC first of all on 2 July and she then heard the matter in the course of that week.  In view of the urgency of the matter she gave a detailed written judgment on 5 July 2013.  In that judgment Her Honour Judge Rowe QC accepted that there had been a change of circumstances since the placement order was made.  What she said about that was as follows:

 

"When decisions were made about F's future, the mother was not in the country and her whereabouts were unknown.  She had not engaged with the local authority in assessments of her parenting.  She had not made herself available for contact with F.  She had not consistently cared either for F or M.  Her relationship with her partner was abusive.  Her immigration status was unresolved.  Today the mother's immigration status remains unresolved.  There was a recent incident of violence which involved the same partner.  She is, however, presently separated from that partner.  Further, she has worked with various local authority professionals for just over a year to maintain (B) or resume (M) the care of her young children.  She has accepted help in relation to accommodation and she has apparently welcomed local authority support, particularly in her care of M.  These changes are I find more than superficial on consideration of the further material filed between the hearings.  Miss Lazarus, the mother's counsel, very sensibly recognised this.  The mother should be given and I do give her substantial credit for making these changes in her life and for achieving the local authority's support in her care of her younger two sons.  I accept that she very much wants the chance to make up for her failure to care for F.  I conclude that her circumstances have changed in nature and degree, not completely but sufficiently for me to consider whether to exercise my discretion to grant her substantive application."  



However, the learned judge then went on to consider the discretion as to whether to give leave to the mother to apply for the revocation of the placement order.  She concluded having reviewed the mother's then situation and the position of F and the fact that prospective adopters were awaiting introduction to F that she would not give leave.  She said at paragraph 80 of her judgment:

"In these circumstances I conclude that the mother's application to revoke the placement order has no real prospect of success.  It cannot be in F's best interests to halt the plan by which he will be placed in his forever family in the next two weeks and instead to make him wait for an unspecified but significant period of time whilst the mother does her best to overcome these enormous hurdles identified above.  The loss of his only chance of an adoptive placement is far too high a price to pay for the prospect which I find to be poor of a placement within this family after all these years."



So on that basis Her Honour Judge Rowe QC, as I have said, refused the mother's application.  



F was then placed with the applicants on 15 July 2013 and they made an application for an adoption order on 6 November.  That application came before me on 22 November when I made an order in the usual form requiring service on the mother and requiring the mother to file and serve on the local authority a statement of any change in circumstances that she was relying upon if she sought leave to oppose the application.  The matter was due to be before the court on 24 January but the matter was considered by the court on 15 January when the hearing was adjourned to today's date with a time estimate of two hours on the basis that the mother was to file with the court and serve on the local authority by 12 February a statement of evidence in support of her application for leave to oppose the adoption application and the local authority were to file and serve their evidence in response by 21 February.  The mother has duly filed her statement and the mother essentially says this: that her situation has greatly changed since the date when the placement order was made on 15 May 2012, she has been living back in the United Kingdom since shortly after that placement order was made, she has had B continuously in her care since then and M in her care since November 2012 and she has cooperated with the local authority in Birmingham where she lives.  

 



The children were the subject of child protection plans at the time of the hearing in front of Her Honour Judge Rowe but in December of last year at a child protection review conference the decision was made that the children would no longer be subject to safeguarding plans and would be treated as children in need.  She has not resumed her relationship with Mr D.  She relies on a number of positive comments in the child protection review conference minutes which say that the mother has good care of B and M; they are clean and tidy; their diet is good.  During visits the mother has been observed encouraging them not to eat in between meals; there is fruit and meat in the fridge and evidence that she prepares meals; the home environment is reportedly clean and tidy with adequate toys and books and they each have their own beds although B still sleeps with his mother.  The reports from the nursery are that M has been attending five afternoons per week since September 2013 with very good attendance.  She brings M to the nursery with B, who is both clean and presentable.  Both children are described as hyperactive.  There are some negative points raised in the child protection conference.  There is a note from the contribution of the social worker that the GP was concerned that the mother was shouting at M whilst at the surgery and this was also noticed on another occasion when she was kept waiting. This was however put down to the mother becoming frustrated and trying to manage two active young children in a strange environment.  

 



The mother is of Croatian Roma origin and it has been noted that the language environment can be difficult for the children in that three different languages including English are spoken to the children but having said that of course it is of great importance that the children are brought up with a full knowledge of their cultural background.  The social worker's view was that the mother was caring adequately for B and M.  She recognises her mistakes and would not do anything to put B and M at risk.  Although the mother apparently presented as defensive to professionals, once matters are explained to her she is responsive to advice given.  

 



Among the risk factors noted was the involvement of the mother in shoplifting, which was described in the conference as a habit which she has made attempts to break.  I have already referred to the suspended sentence to which she was subject for shoplifting and she has recently had to appear before the court in respect of an alleged breach of the suspended sentence order in that she entered the excluded area.  It was also noted that on that occasion she had a number of items in the bottom of B's pram for which she had forgotten to pay when paying for other goods.  The mother's explanation that that was a simple piece of forgetfulness and a mistake was apparently accepted but she nevertheless was required to attend court for being in breach of the exclusion order and it was only on Monday of this week, 24 February, that she was fined the sum of �55 for that and placed on an electronic tag until 25 March.  The case conference had noted that there was a concern about the possible exposure of the mother to a custodial sentence if she continued to engage in shoplifting.  There is no evidence that she has recently engaged in shoplifting but there must be a concern about her recent breach of the exclusion order.  

 



It was also noted at the case conference that the mother's immigration status remains an issue.  She is currently seeking regularisation of that status but is currently not in receipt of public funds as a result of her immigration status.  She receives financial support from NASS, which enables her to meet her living requirements.  

 



The local authority in their evidence accept that the mother has made significant changes in her circumstances and for the purpose of the application which is before me today there is no dispute that that element of the two-stage test which the court must apply to an application of this kind is to be resolved in the mother's favour.  Bearing in mind the judgment of Her Honour Judge Rowe QC to which I have already referred and the mother's continued cooperation with the authorities so that the children are no longer subject to child protection plans, it is undoubted that the mother has demonstrated a change in circumstances for the purpose of section 47(7) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  It is clear from the authorities that the court must in addition to addressing whether there has been a change in circumstances exercise a discretion as to whether in the light of that change in circumstances leave should be given to the parent to oppose the application for adoption and of course the most important of the recent authorities is the case of Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 and I have regard in particular to paragraph 74 of the judgment of the court in that case.  Paragraph 74 sets out ten particular points after indicating the principle, which is that the court has to consider two interrelated questions: 

 

"One, the parent's ultimate prospect of success if given leave to oppose; the other, the impact on the child if the parent is, or is not, given leave to oppose, always remembering, of course, that at this stage the child's welfare is paramount."





This is of course an exercise of discretion pursuant to the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and so it is the child's welfare throughout his lifetime which is paramount.  I must bear in mind that when considering the prospects of success it is the prospect of successfully resisting the making of an adoption order and not necessarily the prospect of ultimately having the child restored to the mother's care which is to be considered.  I must bear in mind that once the court has decided as I have in this case already that there has been a change of circumstances the court must consider very carefully whether the child's welfare really does necessitate the refusal of leave and I must keep at the forefront of my mind that adoption must be regarded as a remedy of last resort and only permissible if "nothing else will do" following the guidance of the Supreme Court in the case of Re B.  I must consider all the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two options, either giving or refusing the parent leave to oppose.  I must also have regard in particular to the fact that the circumstance that a child has been placed with prospective adopters can by no means be regarded as determinative of the application, although it is right to say that the older the child and the longer that child has been in placement, the greater the adverse impacts of disturbing those arrangements would be likely to be.  I have already mentioned that it is welfare throughout the child's lifetime that is important and is paramount and I must consider that it is the long-term and medium-term view of the child's development that is important and not simply a short-term view of problems which might be created.  I remind myself that I should be careful not to attach undue weight to the argument that the granting of leave to oppose would cause an adverse impact on the prospective adopters and thus on the child and I must bear in mind that the test for giving leave to oppose should not be set too high because parents should not be discouraged either from bettering themselves or from seeking to prevent the adoption of their child by the imposition of a test which is unachievable.  

 



In this case I must bear in mind in particular the course of F's life to date and the fact that for the reasons of the history which I have referred to he has not seen his mother since 2010.  He has no knowledge of his own birth family that he is likely to be able to bring to his recollection.  He has spent the period from October 2010 until July 2013 in two foster placements and since July 2013 he has been placed with the present applicants.  I have the evidence from the social worker of the fact that he is now settled in his foster placement, presents as a confident child and interacts well with all members of his prospective adoptive family.  He talks positively about his prospective adoptive grandparents and aunts and uncles; he has been prepared for the move to the adoptive placement as his forever family, which is how he sees them; he calls the Applicants "Mum" and "Dad"; he has an older prospective adoptive sister and has a positive relationship with her; he has had to change school after being placed with adoptive family and there has been a careful transition; he is progressing well and has made new friends and has been invited to several birthday parties, so the process of F's settling into the prospective adoptive family is well under way.  

 



The court must have regard to the disadvantages for F of adoption.  He would not be brought up by his own natural mother or any member of his birth family.  He would not have connection with his brothers, M and B.  He would not be likely to be introduced in any meaningful way to the culture of his mother's family, his Croatian Roma background, although the prospective adopters wish to do what they can to introduce him to that.  He now speaks only English.  He would not have the advantages of having other languages from a very early age.  He would be likely to have some issues as to his identity in adolescence or in early adulthood.  The advantages of adoption for him would be that having been placed in a family which appears to be well able to meet his needs and in which he has settled there is a very good prospect of his remaining successfully in that family for the whole of his childhood and achieving a sense of belonging in that family which would be lifelong.  There would be an extremely good prospect that all his physical, emotional and educational needs would be met. 

 



The other options which fall to be considered for F include, of course, return to the mother, which the mother fervently seeks.  She has really fought for that since her return to this country in May 2012.  The advantages to F of that course of action being followed would be that he would be returning to his birth family and to his mother.  She is obviously committed to him, whatever the difficulties in her commitment at an earlier time may have been, given her young age and difficult circumstances.  He would be able to be with his two brothers, whom he has not yet met.  The disadvantages of a placement with his mother are that this would be yet another change for F, having been carefully prepared for an adoptive placement and introduced to a new "forever" family.  Having now gratefully accepted that family as his forever family it would be necessary for work to be done with him to move him back to the care of his mother.  He would be likely to be very perplexed about that sudden change in his direction of travel.  There are other disadvantages: the mother only on Monday of this week was facing the possibility of a custodial sentence in connection with her history of offending and being in breach of the exclusion order.  She has uncertain immigration status, although there is evidence before the court that her prospects of remaining in this country are reasonably good.  She has no access to public funds at present.  The two children in her care are designated as children in need.  She is receiving assistance in caring for them, so she is not able fully to meet their needs on her own at present, although she is endeavouring to do so.  There would inevitably, it seems to me, be a risk that if F was returned to his mother's care that that would be an unsuccessful rehabilitation.  If it was an unsuccessful rehabilitation the effect on F would be devastating.  In my judgment looking at those disadvantages they greatly outweigh the advantages of a return to his mother's care.  

 



There is the third possible option of a placement in long-term foster care.  That would have the advantage that it can be combined with ongoing contact to the family and contact could be set up but it would have the disadvantage that it would be another change for F; it would be another complete change in the direction of travel for him and one which again he would be bound to find extremely perplexing.  It would not have the advantage of an adoptive placement that it is one which comes very close to imitating the features of a natural family placement in that long-term foster carers are not generally given parental responsibility which resides with the local authority.  F would continue to be a child in care.  It might lead to a change whereby the foster carers became special guardians but that is a matter of speculation for the future.  It is very hard to see any net advantage for F of moving from his current adoptive placement into a long-term foster placement.  

 



In having thus examined the advantages and disadvantages for F of those placements it is very clear to this court that the net advantages for F of remaining in his current adoptive placement are very greatly in excess of any net advantage for him of moving to his mother.  In my judgment, indeed moving to his mother's care would place him at risk of his needs not being met.  Accordingly, when I evaluate the prospects of an opposition by the mother to the adoption application I have reached the clear conclusion that there is no realistic prospect that if I gave leave to the mother she would be able successfully to oppose the making of an adoption order in this case.  In those circumstances for me to give leave for that matter to go ahead and the mother to oppose the adoption application would be to expose F through the impact on his adoptive parents to uncertainty and anxiety for no real benefit at the end of the day.  It would be to raise the mother's hopes and to no real benefit to her at the end of the day.  Accordingly, when I consider the advantages and disadvantages of the granting of leave to the mother I am completely satisfied that the disadvantages of granting the leave application greatly outweigh any possible advantage, so measuring the exercise of my discretion against F's welfare interests throughout his lifetime I am very firmly of the view that I should not grant leave to the mother to oppose this application.  For all those reasons I will dismiss the mother's application for leave.  Before doing so, however, I would note that the mother said in her latest statement:

 

"Ultimately if the court believes that it is not in F's interests for my application for permission to oppose the adoption application to be granted then I can only accept that decision.  I want my son to know when he is old enough and when he has access to these papers that I never stopped fighting for him to come back to me and that I love him dearly and that I did not agree to the adoption."



I respect the mother's statement to that effect and the way in which it is phrased and I understand very much the strength of the mother's feelings but I have to deal with this application on the basis of what is in F's interests, having regard to his welfare throughout his lifetime.

The proceedings came before me first on 7th February 2014 for what was expected to be the final hearing of the adoption application in respect of R, who was made the subject of a placement order by the Family Proceedings Court in November 2012. I will return to the circumstances in which that order was made shortly. 2.                  In advance of the hearing on 7th February 2014, it had become clear to the Local Authority that R�s mother had indicated a wish to oppose the adoption application. She attended the hearing, together with her mental health advocate, MF, from Organisation A and confirmed that position. The Local Authority was represented on that occasion by the Local Authority solicitor, Mr Clarke. I gave directions for evidence to be filed with a view to the case coming back before me today, 26th March 2014, for determination of the application by the mother for permission to oppose the adoption application.  3.                  At the time the case was before me on 7 February 2014, it was unclear whether the mother would secure public funding for legal aid for representation in these proceedings. I was very grateful on that occasion to MF for the obvious assistance that he gave to the mother and, indeed, to the court in explaining the issues to the mother and ensuring that I fully understood what she was seeking to put before the court. The mother is a young woman, now 23 years of age, who has a mild learning disability, as a result of which MF has been providing her with support through Organisation A. 4.                  The directions I gave provided for the mother to file a statement which would set out the necessary matters for the court�s consideration in determining her application for permission to oppose the adoption application. I spent some time explaining to her, with MF�s assistance, that she would need to demonstrate a change since the order was made by the Family Proceedings Court which would provide the court with a proper basis for re‑visiting the issue. I also explained to her that even if those changes were demonstrated, the court would then look to whether she had established a solid basis for seeking to oppose the application and whether R�s welfare interests were met by her being given permission to oppose the adoption. I gave a direction for the Local Authority social worker to file a statement in response and I also gave directions for the relevant documentation to be filed, namely the bundle from the care proceedings and a supplementary bundle relating to the application for permission to oppose. I now have that material, together with written submissions prepared by Mr Blackburn, the Local Authority solicitor who has attended today�s hearing. 5.                  Legal aid has not been granted to the mother despite the best endeavours which have been made on her behalf to secure legal aid. I find it a matter of real regret for a young woman with obvious limitations to find herself without representation, in circumstances in which other applications for permission to oppose are made before me from time to time with the assistance of representation through legal aid. That said, MF offered his ongoing assistance at the time of the hearing before me on 7th February 2014 and he has very clearly done that in assisting the mother in preparing a statement dated 4th March 2014 (which is in the supplementary bundle at page 29). The mother�s position is that she does not agree to the adoption and would like to be able to oppose the adoption, but her principal issue is with the conclusions reached by the Family Proceedings Court at the time that they made the final care order and placement order on 27th November 2012.  6.                  The mother sets out in her statement the circumstances in which she says that the earlier proceedings did not take account of her learning disabilities and that the work which was undertaken with her and the assessment of her did not meet her needs in her circumstances. She was aware from the directions that I had given and the advice that she has received, both from MF and the solicitor who was seeking to act on her behalf, that the court would look to changes since that order was made, in circumstances in which there had been no challenge to the order of the Family Proceedings Court by way of any appeal.  7.                  The mother set out her current circumstances in her statement. She is now living with her grandmother and is not in a relationship. She says that she has settled in her accommodation with her �nana�, as she calls her, and she says that she would like to be able to live there with R. She does not set out any other changes which she invites the court to take account of, other than she is now receiving support from MF and Organisation A and other support services.  8.                  The statement filed by Rachel Halliday, social worker, sets out the Local Authority�s understanding of the mother�s circumstances. There has, it seems, been very little contact with her since the care proceedings concluded. The statement does set out the very positive work which has been undertaken in terms of life story work with information provided by the mother in August 2013.  9.                  The mother�s statement recorded that she still opposes the adoption application but had decided not to attend this hearing to pursue her application in person. She made it clear that this did not indicate any changed position on her part, but simply the position that she had taken with the advice and support of MF and, it seems, the solicitor who had sought to represent her about the approach of the court on such an application. 10.              I am grateful to Mr Blackburn for maintaining contact with MF since the statement was filed, to seek to ascertain whether there was any changed position or whether the mother was likely to attend the hearing. There was most recently an e-mail exchange between Mr Blackburn and MF yesterday. In an e-mail from MF, sent yesterday afternoon shortly after 3pm, he indicated that he doubted that the mother would attend. He says this: �Despite my best efforts, I haven�t been able to contact her regarding attendance or to go through the Local Authority statement. My last contact with her was on 4th March, at which time she didn�t plan on attending the hearing. I assume she will not be attending court tomorrow.�  He then went on to explain his arrangements for the day, should be need to be contacted. There has been some contact between the mother and the Local Authority, in that she spoke to Lynn Stoker, the adoption social worker with responsibility for R. In the course of that telephone conversation - which I believe was yesterday - the mother once again confirmed that she did not intend to attend the hearing. She has not done so. 11.              It is against that unhappy background that I deal with the application for permission to oppose the adoption application. I can set out the relevant background very briefly. As I have already indicated, I have the full care bundle from the proceedings before the Family Proceedings Court, as well as the supplementary bundle filed in relation to the application for permission to oppose. The care bundle sets out the full material which was before the court and I also have the Magistrates� reasons. It is clear that the Local Authority were concerned about the circumstances in which the mother was pregnant and her ability to care for her baby in the light of her difficulties. The relationship between the mother and the father appears to have come to an end before R�s birth on 13th September 2011. The father does not have parental responsibility for R � he is not named on his birth certificate and hasn�t otherwise acquired parental responsibility. He has not engaged in these proceedings, although he was notified of them. 12.              Following R�s birth he lived in the care of his mother until he was admitted to hospital on 17th April 2012, where he was found to be quite poorly and suffering from gastroenteritis. There was considerable concern about the care the mother was able to give him, such that he was accommodated and placed with foster carers on 20th April 2012. He remained with foster carers throughout the care proceedings, which concluded some seven months later. The care proceedings included assessments of the mother, not only by the Local Authority but also an assessment undertaken of her by Dr Lisa Rippon, a consultant psychiatrist. These assessments did not support R�s placement with his mother. The Local Authority did not consider there to be any alternative family placement that would meet R�s needs. In these circumstances, the Local Authority plan put before the court in November 2012 was for R�s placement for adoption. The care plan proposed indirect contact for R with his birth family. That care plan was approved by the court in making the final care order.  13.              I have already referred to the mother�s view that her learning disability was not adequately accounted for in the manner of assessment and consideration of her case before the Family Proceedings Court. Mr Blackburn has been able to give me a little more information about the circumstances of her representation. It appears that there was a change in the solicitor representing her during the course of the proceedings. She was, however, represented by experienced specialist family counsel at the hearing before the Family Proceedings Court. On 27th November 2012 the court made a final care order, approving the care plan of adoption and indirect contact, and then proceeded to deal with the placement application. The court made a placement order approving the plan of adoption and dispensing with the mother�s consent to the application on the basis that R�s welfare required it. Both sets of reasons are included in the supplementary bundle filed for today�s hearing. 14.              The final contact took place between the mother and R on 3rd December 2012. In August 2013 the life story work was undertaken, which will provide valuable information for R in the future. R was duly matched with his prospective adopters and then placed with them on 3rd September 2013. He has now been in that placement for six months. On all accounts, R is thriving in the placement, in which he is very well loved and his needs are very well met. 15.              In determining this application, I have applied the following legal framework. The magistrates made a placement orders in respect of R on 27th November 2012 pursuant to section 26 Adoption and Children Act 2002. Parental consent was dispensed with in accordance with section 52. Section 47 Adoption and Children Act 2002 sets out the conditions for making an adoption order. The relevant parts are as follows: (1) An adoption order may not be made if the child has a parent or guardian unless one of the following three conditions is met;  (4) The second condition is that� (a) the child has been placed for adoption by an adoption agency with the prospective adopters in whose favour the order is proposed to be made, (b)... (ii) the child was placed for adoption under a placement order, and (c) no parent or guardian opposes the making of the adoption order. (5) A parent or guardian may not oppose the making of an adoption order under the second condition without the court�s leave... (7) The court cannot give leave under subsection (5) unless satisfied that there has been a change in circumstances since... the placement order was made. 16.              I make it clear that, in the application of these provisions, I have taken account of the following principles. Article 8 rights for respect for private and family life are clearly engaged. There can be no clearer situation where that is the case. The order proposed is an adoption order, altering the legal relationships for R so that his relationships with his birth family are terminated. Such an order can only be made where it is necessary and proportionate. Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption are very extreme orders of last resort to be made in exceptional circumstances, where nothing else will do and where no other course is possible in a child�s interests: Re B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33.  17.              Section 47(5) Adoption and Children Act 2002 is intended to provide a real and meaningful remedy in appropriate cases. An application pursuant to section 47(5) is considered in two stages: first, has there been a change in circumstances; second, if so, should leave to oppose be granted? The first question, whether there has been a relevant change in circumstances, was considered in Re P (Adoption and Leave Provisions) [2007] EWCA Civ 616 where Wall LJ said in paragraphs 30 to 32 that the change of circumstances since a placement order was made must be of a nature and degree sufficient on the facts of a particular case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion to defend the adoption proceedings. Whether or not there has been a relevant change in circumstances is a matter of fact to be decided by good sense and sound judgment of the tribunal hearing the application. 18.              The second question, if there has been a change in circumstances whether leave should be given, was addressed in detail in the judgment of the President in Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146. At paragraph 74, he said the court needs to consider all the circumstances, in particular two interrelated questions: (1) the parents� ultimate prospect of success if leave is given and (2) the impact on the child if the parent is or is not given leave to oppose, remembering that the child�s welfare is paramount at this stage. The court must assess whether the parent has established a solid basis for seeking permission to oppose the application. The President set out ten factors relevant to the weighing and balancing of the considerations in any case.  19.              I pause to record that the welfare consideration is in accordance with section 1 Adoption and Children Act, so that the child�s welfare throughout his or her life is the court�s paramount consideration and the extended welfare checklist in section 1(4) must be applied, requiring the court to consider, among other factors, the impact on the child of ceasing to be a member of the birth family and becoming an adopted person and the relationship the child has with the birth family, including the likelihood of the relationship continuing and the value of it doing so, the ability and willingness of the birth family to meet the child�s needs and the wishes and feelings of the birth family. 20.              In this case I have already alluded to the changes which have been set out by the mother in her statement. They are very limited changes in her day-to-day living arrangements and fall very far short of the changes which the court would require to be persuaded that they were of a nature and degree sufficient on the facts of this case to open the door to the exercise of judicial discretion. The conclusions of the assessments that R could not safely be returned to his mother�s care were based on the history of her neglect of his needs when he was in her care and the professional assessment that she was not able to improve her parenting abilities in such a way which would allow her to provide consistently for R�s needs to a good enough standard. 21.              I am quite satisfied on the evidence that I have read and heard that the changes which are relied upon by the mother fall far short of what would be required for the court to reach the second stage analysis of R�s welfare considerations. In these circumstances, the second stage of the test does not fall for consideration. I nonetheless record that, on the information before me, there is no solid basis for her application. I also make it clear that, had I been in a position to reach the welfare analysis stage of the application, the material which is before me strongly argues that R�s welfare needs are such that any application for permission to oppose should not be permitted.  22.              I therefore refuse the mother�s application for permission to oppose the adoption application. I will direct a transcript of this judgment to be prepared at public expense (as I do in every case where an application for permission to oppose is made) and the court will then list the adoption application on the first convenient date after 21 days.

HHJ Wildblood QC : 



Introduction - These are public law family proceedings in which Bristol City Council seeks care and placement orders in relation to LJ, who is eleven months old, having been born on [a date in] 2013. He has been living with foster carers under interim care orders since the day after his birth and his mother has been having contact with him once a week since October 2013 (before that, twice a week). 

 

LJ's mother, M, is aged nearly 20 and opposes the Local Authority's applications; she seeks the rehabilitation of LJ to her care and contends that she and LJ should live together in a mother and baby foster placement before moving into the community. LJ's father, F is aged 22 and, although he knew about the hearing, took no part in it and was not represented. He does not put himself or any member of his family forward as a potential carer of LJ.  The guardian (Ms Clutterbuck), the independent social worker (Ms Karen Singer) and the psychologist (Ms Gillian Evans) support the Local Authority. The Local Authority care plan at D17 proposes that F should not have any contact with LJ. It proposes that M should have indirect contact twice a year via the 'letterbox' system. 

 

Although the mother has two older children who live separately with relatives of their different fathers, it is not possible to arrange for LJ to live with either of his half siblings (their carers do not wish to care for him).

 

This case arises in the context of contentions that the mother suffered an abusive upbringing that has left her isolated and insufficiently mature or stable to care for a child either now or in a timescale that meets LJ's needs. It is without doubt a very sad case.

 

At the Issues Resolution Hearing I clarified the options that were being placed before the court. The Local Authority and guardian propose that LJ should be placed for adoption with as yet unidentified adopters; given his age they do not envisage any difficulty in finding adopters for him. The mother proposes rehabilitation to her care after further residential support and assessment. No party has sought to argue that long term fostering presents itself as a sensible or viable option for LJ. No party suggests that there are any family members or other identified adults who could care for LJ if M is not able to do so. Thus the case has proceeded on the basis that there are only two options: placement for adoption or rehabilitation to the mother. I agree that those are the only two possibilities on the facts of this case.

 

It is also agreed that, at the heart of this case, is the jurisprudence of Re B [2013] UKSC 33 that LJ should not be deprived of the right to an upbringing with his mother unless, as a last resort, there are exceptional circumstances demonstrating that no other solution compatible with his welfare is available. Of the dicta in Re B the President said in Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146: 'The language used in Re B is striking. Different words and phrases are used, but the message is clear. Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are "a very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do", where "no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interests", they are "the most extreme option", a "last resort � when all else fails", to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short, where nothing else will do": see Re B paras 74, 76, 77, 82, 104, 130, 135, 145, 198, 215 [22]'.

 

M's other children - LJ is M's third child. Her other children, with whom she now has contact once a month, are:

 

i)	Chd1, who is aged 3, having been born on [a date in] 2010. Her father is JB (aged 20). Chd1 lives with her paternal grandmother and her partner under special guardianship orders [KK30]. JB has been involved with illegal drugs and drinks excessively; 

ii)	Chd2, who is aged 2. Her father is BW (aged 20). BW had an upbringing where he was exposed to neglect and parental drug taking [C30]. Chd2 lives with her paternal great grandparents. On 15th January 2014 M pleaded guilty to assaulting BW on 31st July 2013 and is now subject to a conditional discharge for 18 months (the magistrates found that she was not guilty of a linked charge of arson). 

Final hearing - This case has benefited from a very high degree of good representation by each of the advocates. However, these proceedings have not displayed any manifestations of expedition in the lead up to the final hearing. Further, the evidence that was available when this hearing started in February was plainly unsatisfactory. The Local Authority had conducted an interim parenting assessment and had been ordered to do a full parenting assessment. It did not carry out that assessment because of allegations that arose that the mother and F were still seeing each other, contrary to their contentions that they had separated in April. A fact finding hearing was listed in October but did not proceed after the Local Authority withdrew those allegations due to the lack of evidence to support them. Ms Karen Singer was then ordered to do a parenting assessment of the mother. Neither Ms Singer nor the social worker who filed evidence after the fact finding hearing absorbed the point made by the judge before whom the fact finding hearing was listed that the unproven and withdrawn allegations must be treated as being without factual substance. Evidence of the services that the Local Authority might provide if LJ were to be rehabilitated to the mother was only provided on the morning of the February 2014 hearing and during the social worker's initial evidence; a statement was filed after that hearing (C164) and so was available when the case resumed on 5th March.

 

The hearing started before me on Monday 3rd February 2014 by which time it was already well beyond the 26 week period in which it should have been resolved. I heard the evidence of Ms Singer, the evidence of the social worker (Ms White) and the evidence of the mother. The case was being argued on the basis that the Local Authority considered that the mother had not developed sufficient maturity since the removal from her of her two older children in 2012 for her to care for LJ. Part of the mother's case, skilfully presented, was that there had not been any adequate assessment of the mother and that the assessments that had taken place had been based on an oversight of the conclusions of the fact finding hearing.

 

Gaps in the February evidence - As those initial two days in February progressed I became increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of the evidence that I was hearing. I was also particularly dissatisfied with the omissions from, and misunderstandings within, the parenting assessments of Ms Singer and the social worker. This led to the adjournment of the case from the February hearing to the resumed hearing that started on 5th March 2014.

 

There were the following particular features of the February hearing that were unsatisfactory:

 

i)	The Local Authority relied heavily on psychological evidence that had been obtained in January 2012 from a Dr Radford. Dr Radford has now retired. There was no update of psychological material. If I had to summarise in a sentence the views then expressed by Dr Radford it would be that she suggested that the mother did not then have sufficient maturity to care for her two older children in the light of her own damaging past. 

ii)	The lack of information about the Freedom Programme that the mother had said that she was attending. That Programme is intended to assist women to educate themselves in how to avoid domestically violent relationships. This was therefore important, given the mother's previous pattern of associating with violent men by whom she had children. As matters transpired it was very fortunate that further evidence was sought on this issue as it was revealed that the mother had given untruthful evidence about her attendance.

iii)	The absence of medical evidence that was available to deal with the mother's assertion that she missed a large number of contact sessions because she was depressed and deprived of sleep. She suggested that she had assistance from her GP at the time and that the GP could confirm this. Therefore evidence was to be obtained by the mother and her solicitor for the March hearing to support this;

iv)	The lack of knowledge about whether a care leaver's package had been put in place in relation to the mother and how the mother had responded. Indeed, no one could tell me in February when the mother had been in care and what support had been offered to her under Part III of The Children Act 1989. 

v)	There was only limited evidence of the services that the Local Authority could provide to support the options for LJ.

By the time that the hearing resumed on 5th March 2014 Ms Gillian Evans had carried out a fresh psychological assessment. In it she concluded at E37: 'On balance, sadly, I am of the view that whilst some improvements have been made I cannot recommend that M be considered as a carer for LJ'.  In her report Ms Evans said that M appeared to have shown some greater maturity, has engaged in positive contact with LJ, appeared to have made better lifestyle choices and to be in a position where the prognosis for her to succeed in a residential unit 'would appear reasonably positive'. 

 

However Ms Evans also recorded that she considered that M is particularly vulnerable because of her insecure adult attachment style, relative isolation and lack of effective support. She also questioned the mother's commitment to maintain the changes in her lifestyle and was concerned by the mother's apparent lack of attendance at the Freedom Programme. She said at E37: 'Significant concerns relate to the longer term and whether M is sufficiently mature and resilient enough to cope on her own, over time, with the stresses of parenting given her relative isolation / lack of an effective support network�she has not yet had the opportunity to demonstrate sustained change in terms of lifestyle over a longer period, which she needs to be able to do prior to being considered as a carer for LJ or any subsequent child'.

 

Having seen the evidence of Ms Evans the Local Authority and the guardian filed position statements in which they expressed their adherence to the recommendation that LJ should be placed for adoption.

 

By the time of the hearing in March it was revealed that M had not attended the Freedom Programme this year at all. M had implied in her discussions with Ms Evans that she had been attending but, on questioning by Ms Evans, had not been able to tell her where the programme meetings had been taking place (although M did know that the meetings were taking place on Wednesdays). When I asked in March what M's case was on this issue I was then told that M accepts that she has not attended the programme this year; she said that she had been to the programme venue on occasions but did not participate in the group. This is in marked contrast to what she said in oral and sworn evidence at the February hearing � then she had said that she had attended on three or four occasions since Christmas and expressed a commitment to the programme. It was accepted at the March hearing that M had not told the truth about this when giving evidence in February.

 

It was the revelation that the mother had not attended the Programme this year at all (quite rightly communicated to the court by Ms Flexman when she was informed of the position) that led to the mother leaving the court building on 5th March in distress faced with the recognition that her untruthfulness was now known and the consequences that that recognition might have.

 

The mother returned to court on 6th March (after I had issued a written order that she must do so) and I was then handed a note which M had signed and which read: 'I have not participated in the Freedom Programme since Christmas 2013. I have been to the venue a few occasions but felt unable to go in because of another girl who is there. When I did attend before Christmas I did find it helped me to unpick things and it made me realise things about JB, LJ and BW. If I moved out of the area I would want to carry on doing this type of work and go somewhere like the Meriton as well'.

 

No evidence was produced from the mother's GP for the March hearing. The procedure that was to be followed is set out in the order of 5th February 2014 at B77. The solicitor for the mother was to obtain a letter from the GP dealing with this point. The solicitor, Ms Cummins, sent a letter of authority to the mother for the information to be provided. The mother says that she did not receive the draft letter of authority. Since I delivered this judgment in court, Ms Cummin has written to inform me that she sent the form of authority to the mother for completion and return on three separate occasions and spoke to the mother by telephone, requesting its return. Unfortunately, the signed authority was never received and accordingly it was not possible to seek or obtain the report. No further steps were taken, therefore, to obtain this information until I suggested that efforts might be made to obtain it during the hearing. However, by then it was too late and no party sought to suggest that the hearing should be adjourned to obtain it.

 

By the time of the March hearing a statement had been filed by Anna Lemke-Elms (C157) who was the mother's social worker when she was placed with Chd1 on 15th December 2010. Ms Lemke-Elms says that M became a 'relevant care leaver' on her 18th birthday (i.e. on 12th March 2012) and that she and M met each other frequently over a period of 2 � years. I was told that it was not possible to discover from the Local Authority records the dates upon which the mother was in care (which, I said, was absurd). Ms Lemke concluded her statement in these terms: 'In the 2 � years I have worked with M her level of engagement has varied from weekly contacts to periods of non engagement. M has had a very difficult past 3 years with the on-going court cases in relation to her 3 children and also a succession of abusive relationships. It has been difficult to engage M in effective planning as she has been in the court process for the majority of the past 3 years or has been in abusive relationships, which also makes planning difficult. I have offered very practical support and also supported her through crisis periods including several moves. I believe the key to her development is gaining support around healthy relationships which can be offered through the Freedom Programme. I think it would be useful for M to engage in some form of education or training which I will again explore once we know the court outcome�I believe that M does have the capacity to parent effectively in the future but only once she has accessed effective support around abusive relationships and also accessed support around the loss of her children'.

 

As to the Local Authority services that would be available to support options, the social worker filed a statement which is at C164 and which sets out the Local Authority's position. In my opinion it is a well balanced, if somewhat belated, statement and sets out how rehabilitation would have to be arranged if the court decided to pursue it; this would involve placement in a mother and baby foster placement and then accommodation in a residential unit. The statement analyses the positives and negatives of adoption (C170). It ends with the conclusion that the Local Authority adheres to its care plan for adoption (C171).

 

Paternity - Shortly before the hearing began some doubt arose as to whether F is LJ's father or whether JB, the father of M's oldest child, is also the father of LJ. M asserted at the hearing that she was quite sure that F was LJ's father but, at the request of the Local Authority, I ordered that DNA tests should be carried out. On 7th February 2014 a report was prepared by 'Anglia DNA' which excluded JB as a possible father of LJ, leaving F as the only candidate for paternity of LJ.

 

M � M lives in a city area. Her own childhood, in which she spent periods in care, was marred by emotional abuse and instability. She is now isolated from her family. Her mother, KH, has a gambling addiction and, when she last stayed with M, made a suicide attempt. Her father, WG (i.e. not her uncle, as was wrongly suggested by the social worker in her statement at C133) has a long standing drug addiction and was absent for much of M's childhood. M does not suggest that any member of her family could assist her with the care of LJ and no member of her family has been suggested as a substitute carer for him. She has a difficult relationship with her older sister R (aged 24), who, she says 'has a lot of problems' and was violent to her during her childhood [KK67]. She has a brother C (aged 23) who she does not see. 

 

She is said to have blocked out some of the memories of her childhood and the view taken in 2012 by a psychologist and other professionals is that she was probably sexually abused as well (a suggestion that is insufficiently evidence based to be reliable).  The psychologist, Dr Radford, suggested in 2012 that M tends to 'log out' and says that a potential explanation is that 'as a very young child, at times when life was traumatic and she was placed under severe stress she either disconnected from what was going on by dissociating from the event or experiencing episodes of derealisation in which she would log out from these experiences'.

 

She became pregnant with her first child, Chd1 at the age of 15 and, very shortly after that birth, she became pregnant with Chd2 at the age of 16 (giving birth at 17). Her relationships with the fathers were unstable and volatile.

 

M's final statement is at C148. In it she says that she ended her relationship with F in April 2013 and has not formed any new relationships since [C151]. She states that she would wish to enter a mother and baby placement with LJ and says at C152: 'I accept that in 2011/12 when I was placed in a mother and baby placement with my two older children this did break down. However, that is not to say that it was a wholly negative assessment. I remained in the placement for many months. In addition I would say that this was two years ago and I believe that things have changed since then'. She expresses her opposition to adoption, says that she is no longer taking medication for depression and, she said, has benefited from attending the Freedom Programme.

 

Previous proceedings - There were proceedings relating to Chd1 and Chd2  which ended in October 2012.  On 15th December 2010 the mother and Chd1 were placed in a mother and baby foster placement [KK4]. That arose after an allegation had been made that BW had shaken Chd1, although there was no medical evidence of damage to her [KK54]. Shortly after, on 26th January 2011, M left the placement and 'absconded' with LJ. On 28th January 2011 Chd1 returned to the foster placement and, on 24th February 2011, M joined Chd1 there (and so the mother and baby placement was resumed) [KK39]. By this stage she was already pregnant with Chd2. Her relationship with BW was volatile and violent.

 

When Chd2 was born, M and the two girls all moved on 10th November 2011 to another placement.  That second placement broke down leading to interim care orders being made in relation to those two children. It was on 9th January 2012 that M left the foster home and would not tell the social worker where she was [KK32 � i.e. the findings of DJ (MC) Cooper)]. M's basic care of the children was also noted to have deteriorated during this time [DJ Cooper's findings at KK32]. Both children were removed from the mother on 26th January 2012 and, within a relatively short period, were living with their current family carers [KK14]. M was offered contact three times a week but did not attend consistently. As a result and pending the final hearing in October 2012, contact was reduced to once a week [KK40]. The final hearing took place six months before LJ was born and at a time when M was already pregnant with him. 

 

It is within those proceedings that the psychologist, Dr Shirley Radford wrote a report on 30th January 2012 [KK49] and an addendum report on 13th April 2012 [KK85]. Dr Radford had seen M on 16th January 2012. In those reports Dr Radford suggested that M did not have the maturity or emotional regulation to care for the children. She concluded that M did not show signs of mental illness or personality disorder [KK81] and she assessed M's full scale IQ at 80 (Ms Evans assessed it at 78 - E26). Dr Radford said as follows in her report at KK82 (i.e. written two years ago when M was aged 17) : 

 



'In my opinion, M has a relatively simplistic understanding of the concerns of the Local Authority. In conversation she appeared to me to recognise that her past relationships have been violent and abusive and she was able to recognise and describe some of the ways in which she would change her behaviours in the future. 





I would have significant concerns about her ability to recognise and protect the children in terms of the issues of potentially sexually abusive experiences. She maintains that she has no recall of her own history in which comments in the case papers suggest that she was sexually abused in childhood.





In discussion she found it very difficult to recognise the potential risks posed by some of the members of her family although she was able to describe that she would be worried if any of them took an unnatural interest in the children and wanted to baby-sit them all the time or saw them as 'special' in some way.





I do not feel that she would fully recognise the risk issues to her children in relation to domestic violence and exposure to situations of potential sexual abuse. She might gain further insight into the issues of domestic violence and the risks to her children from some intervention in terms of sessions at The Meriton.





However, it is difficult to envisage how she could be helped to recognise situations which could place her children at risk of being sexually abused as she is unable to remember her own abuse and the risk is that she dissociates when presented with situations which remind her of her own abuse experiences'.





...There is some evidence that M has a basic understanding of potential risks to the children in terms of witnessing domestic violence�However, this is at a very na�ve level and�I would recommend that she engages in some intervention related to domestic violence and sexually abusive behaviours in order to try to help her to develop a better understanding of these issues..





�In my opinion, the issue in terms of her parenting ability is less likely to be one of providing adequate care to the children, rather her ability to consistently meet their emotional needs and to protect them from harm. I think that she is a very vulnerable young woman who is likely to seek to have her own emotional needs met as a matter of priority. It may be that she will mature over the next few years but this may be outside of the timescale of the children.





�In my opinion there is no specific therapeutic psychological intervention that I would recommend for M at present due to her denial of having any memory of her traumatic past�However�I think that she would benefit from some sessions to address issues of domestic violence in relationships and to address risk issues in terms of sexually abusive behaviours'.  



F - F has one other child, MA (who is aged 5). Her mother is MG. The relationship between F and MG was volatile, influenced by illegal drugs and violent [K54]. On 23rd May 2013 HHJ Rutherford made a special guardianship order in relation to her.

 

F had a very difficult childhood in which he was exposed by his father to violence, neglect and drugs. He had little contact with his mother. He is regarded to be a volatile and unstable man. A psychological report at K94 states: 'Both MG and F have a childhood experience of neglectful and chaotic parenting and anxious / ambivalent attachment relationships�Whilst both parents have histories of poor emotional regulation and aggressive behaviour, F also has significant issues with loss / bereavement. He appears to have a particularly poor ability to regulate his emotions and self-soothe'.

 

M said that she has known F for 5 or 6 years but started going out with them in March 2012. She said that she did not know that he had a propensity for violence at the time. In evidence she described him as a distraught, violent boy but said that she only became aware of his propensity for violence on one occasion when he locked her in the house although, she said, he was not violent to her then but did shout. She said that she never witnessed him being violent. I did not believe her evidence on this point. In the light of everything that is said about him in these proceedings and in the proceedings relating to Chd2 she must have known full well what he was like. M herself regards him as so destructive and hostile that, if LJ returns to her, she says that she would move to a new location in order to avoid him.

 

I note that Ms Evans says at E33 that 'M continues to be fearful of F particularly in relation to him seeking to disrupt / remove LJ from his placement, particularly should she and LJ be placed together. M's fear being palpable'. Ms Evans said in evidence that M's body language communicated that fear when she met the mother. I accept that evidence (which was not in dispute).

 

LJ � LJ is a healthy child who has become attached to the foster carers with whom he has lived since the day after his birth. It is very unfortunate that it has taken this amount of time for these proceedings to come before the court for resolution.

 

Initially M was having supervised contact twice a week for one hour each session. The Local Authority says [C137] that, initially, these contact visits were positive. However, by October 2013 her attendance at contact became less consistent and it became apparent that she was suffering from sleep deprivation and depression. Therefore it was agreed that contact would be reduced to once a week with each session lasting for two hours; that arrangement also meant that it was not necessary for M to engage twice each week in the difficult transport arrangements by which contact took place.  On the second day of the hearing the mother did not arrive until 11.15 a.m. having overslept (and was also late back from lunch on the first day); she said that she had been 'up all night thinking about court'. She did not attend contact on 3rd March because, she said, she overslept. I accept that M was depressed last autumn and that this is part of the reason she did not attend contact. However, I also have an abundance of evidence that the mother lacks organisational fortitude and 'logs out' when faced with difficulties; I am quite sure that those tendencies also played a significant part in why she missed contact. 

 

The schedule of attendance at contact from the papers is as follows:

Since 27th January, M has attended 4 of the weekly contact sessions but not the contact that was due to take place on Monday 3rd March. I was told that the mother intended to go on 3rd March but her alarm did not go off and she missed the 9 a.m. phone call that she had to make to confirm that contact was to happen. She did not ring to explain this to anyone.

 

The Local Authority � The social worker, Ms White, has plainly found this a difficult case. She said that she hears repeated and adverse suggestions about M from within the local community. Like the independent social worker, Ms White plainly found it difficult to adjust to the withdrawal of a fact finding hearing; her final statement still referred to the original allegations that had been withdrawn and her position was that 'due to the high level and constant reporting throughout these proceedings it has been very difficult to dismiss or not question the allegations / concerns put before me. The fact that M's initial response to these allegations / concerns has been limited and she has produced very flimsy evidence through her statement to substantiate people are out to cause problems for her, has left many questions unanswered' [C135]. At C134 she said: 'M's behaviour / presentation with me contradicts reporting from mother professional people involved in this case where M has presented volatile to others and remained in a relationship with F, colluding with him in respect of LJ'. 

 

Her opinion that M and F had colluded together to hide a continuing relationship and communication was the very issue that lay behind the fact finding hearing. That allegation was withdrawn and, after I had asked at the February hearing and given opportunity for instructions to be taken, I was told that no evidence would be presented to suggest a continuation of any affectionate relationship between them after that fact finding hearing. There is now accepted evidence that they have continued to encounter each other (in particular in a public house) where hostile exchanges have apparently occurred (C174). It is also accepted that, as a result of F's emotional chaos there would be a real risk that he would undermine M's care of LJ if he became aware that LJ had returned to her care in a location of which he was aware.

 

Threshold � This is now agreed on the basis of the document at A31. It is based on the removal of Chd2 and Chd1, the assessment of Dr Radford, the failure of the mother to engage with professionals during the pregnancy, the removal of Chd2 from F and the threats that F has made. That is plainly sufficient for the provisions of section 31(2) to be fulfilled and I conclude that the criteria are satisfied on that basis.

 

These proceedings - These proceedings began on the day after the birth of LJ when the Local Authority made an application for an emergency protection order. At that time LJ was still at the hospital. The Local Authority application at B9 sets out the reasons why it thought it necessary to issue these proceedings. It states:

 



'The mother's previous children�.were both removed from the mother's care due to neglect and physical abuse from the mother's former partners. The father's daughter MD is currently the subject of ongoing care proceedings due to concerns of domestic violence and emotional abuse.





Professionals have reported hearing the father being verbally abusive to the mother. The father struggles to manage his emotions and is often threatening and abusive. In September 2012 he abducted his daughter from the care of a foster carer. On 4th April 2013 the father made a threat to his GP that he would remove Chd2 from Local Authority care.





Despite efforts to work with the parents throughout the mother's pregnancy they have both failed to engage and have stated that they will not work with Children and Young People's Services. On 23rd January 2013 the parents met the social work team. At the end of the meeting the father stated he had nothing to lose and would get a passport for the baby.





The father had to be removed from the hospital by security on 13th April 2013 when the mother went into labour due to him forcing his way on to the ward. The father has been forceful on the phone to the hospital staff since LJ Junior was born. He has informed the social worker that he will 'take everyone out' at court when he was informed the Local Authority would be making an urgent application to the court.





The Local Authority is concerned that the parents will try and remove the child from hospital and avoid engagement with professionals'.



The case was transferred to the County Court by HHJ Marston (sitting as a District Judge of the Magistrates Court) on the day of issue (15th April 2013) and an interim care order was made. Interim care orders have been in place every since. On 17th April HHJ Marston gave directions leading to a case management conference ('CMC') on 31st May 2013. 

 

Ms White, the social worker, carried out an interim parenting assessment shortly before that hearing; it was concluded on 28th May 2013. She wrote: 'Historic indications are that M does not have the capacity to change within LJ's timescales and the outstanding intensive therapy necessary for M to have any recovery from her own abusive childhood has no end date. Therefore the Local Authority are not in a position to support a mother  and baby foster placement / unit and feel it is in LJ's best interest to remain in his current placement'.  After this, Ms White said in evidence, she did two or three more 'sessions' with M and then the Local Authority decided that it would not assess the mother further as a result of its suspicions that the mother and F were continuing in their relationship or, at least, were communicating with each other still. 

 

Ms White said in evidence that, by the end of the interim assessment, the position of the Local Authority was that it would like to carry out further assessments as to whether the mother and baby should move together to a joint foster placement. 

 

At the case management hearing on 31st May 2013 [B34] HHJ Barclay joined F and made an order which provided that the Local Authority's final parenting assessment of mother was 'to be filed and served by 4 p.m. on the 22nd August 2013'. That order was made after the court was told by the Local Authority representative that there was sufficient merit in the interim report for a full parenting assessment of the mother to be needed.

 

Viability assessments for residual assessments of the mother were carried out by Crown House in Malvern (A12) and by Dudley Lodge (A14). Both organisations concluded that M was not suited to a residential assessment with them at that time. Crown House stated at A13 that M needed to complete domestic violence work, remain separated from F, attend her contacts and continue to engage well with professionals. Crown House stated that, if those requirements were met, they would re-consider her for a residential assessment. Mrs Clements of Crown House stated: 'I believe that it is critically important that M is able to evidence a definitive separation from F'.

 

Mr Jim Evans of Dudley House wrote that 'it is my professional opinion that the family would be best placed together with a supportive foster placement for 12 months' [A14]. Ms White said in evidence that she had not seen these reports before giving evidence but understood that the viability assessments had been 'negative'. 

 

On 10th July 2013 there was an advocates' meeting in which the Local Authority said it would no longer assess the mother. On 13th August 2013 the case came before HHJ Barclay and he recorded on the face of the order that the Local Authority had indicated that 'it does not intend to file a further parenting assessment of mother as ordered at paragraph 18 of the order of 31st May 2013 due to the belief that the mother has resumed a relationship with F, a belief that will be tested at the fact finding hearing on 3rd and 4th of September 2013'. The hearing on 3rd and 4th September was adjourned. The Local Authority did not complete a parenting assessment after this.

 

On 16th July 2013, the social worker wrote a statement in which she said at C68: 'M's history, patterns of behaviour and violent controlling relationships continue to impact on LJ's life and in fact her older children, leaving them at high risk of harm and emotional neglect. The fact that M continues to  remain or reform such relationships leads the Local Authority to conclude that no further assessment of M' is necessary at this time based on the evidence laid out in this report. Because of this the Local Authority's position is that it could not support a Mother and baby foster placement for the reasons set out above'.

 

On 17th September 2013 it was directed that a hearing on 16th and 17th October was to be a fact finding hearing to deal with the allegations of the Local Authority that M and F were still seeing each other. The schedule of allegations is at C103. It included a poorly pleaded allegation that 'M was / is in regular contact with F and may be / have commenced another relationship with him, during which time she informed him of the dates and times of contact sessions between mother and LJ, contrary to what had been agreed with the Local Authority'.

 

On 16th October 2013 the allegations that the Local Authority were pursuing were withdrawn. The order records on its face that the withdrawal was 'due to there being insufficient evidence to meet the standard of proof' [B53]. Arrangements were made for another directions hearing to take place on 22nd October 2013. 

 

On 22nd October 2013, HHJ Rutherford DL gave directions which included provision for Ms Karen Singer to file a parenting assessment of the mother. The case was listed for IRH and final hearing before HHJ Rutherford. Due to listing difficulties (and the need for expedition in a very delayed case) the matter has been listed before me.

 

On 14th December 2013, Ms Singer filed her report. In it Ms Singer concludes that she is 'not able to recommend that M has care of her son LJ for the following reasons: 

 



�M remains a vulnerable woman�





M is making efforts to change her environment but it is not known whether this will be achieved. Her current home, especially its isolation and M's unhappiness living there, would cause concern and lead to her continuing to seek links with others as a means of fulfilling a life that she is able to tolerate and enjoy. The isolation, if with LJ, would also be of concern if M became ill and in view of her asthma, and how that would affect her ability to cope�.





The history of her relationship with the three fathers of her children is one of turmoil and periodic aggression�.





M is asking for a placement in a mother and baby unit but i) past experiences in two such placements were not successful, ii) the wider issues of her life remain unresolved, with no new significant changes that could justify a renewed placement in such a unit being sought, iii) I was unable to see any unit literature that would fit the circumstances of the present situation; iv) LJ would be unsettled by such a move and would be unsettled again if the placement did not succeed given the high likelihood of that occurring.





�Sadly similar issues remain over the present proceedings as previously (i.e. in the proceedings relating to Chd1 and Chd2) in terms of risks in relationships, changing levels of co-operation, M's own emotional needs and at times loss of emotional control, and LJ would therefore be as equally at risk as the previous children.





M's contact with LJ has been variable in terms of attendance, including during the weeks of my assessment. She had recently requested twice a week contact be reduced to once a week and this was agreed and the time increased during contact. On a practical level the two journeys a week were tiring for her and the reduction limited that'.



Ms Singer said that 'not all aspects of the situation are negative however'. She said that M was seen to be capable of undertaking satisfactory physical care of LJ and to recognise some aspects of his emotional needs and development. She recorded that M has begun the 'Freedom Programme' and expresses interest in it. She said that M 'can relate well and be pleasant in her communication' and that she has maintained contact with her other children.

 

Ms Singer concluded at C129 as follows:

 

i)	I believe M has the ability to be a good parent in the future, if she focuses her attention on continuing the current course relating to domestic abuse, continues to meet and co-operate with her after care worker and the social worker when required; and if she follows up and fully engages with any identified therapy or counselling when that is identified and made available;

ii)	This process will take more time that LJ's timescale�

iii)	LJ's father, F, also has potential in the longer term to act appropriately if he undertakes skilled therapeutic or counselling programs to resolve the pain he continues to feel and that I believe stems from past trauma and that too will take considerable time.

iv)	I am not able to name resources that would assist M care for LJ�However, if LJ is returned to her care, I believe the support needed is for a responsible adult to be present throughout�there is no professional system that provides this beyond those few units where a limited time scale of three months exists; and there is no family member in M's extended family, given the existence of widespread concerns'.

On 6th January 2014 the Local Authority social worker, Louise White filed her final statement in which she recommended that care and placement orders should be made [C147].

 

On 25th January 2014 the guardian, Ms Clutterbuck, filed her report. On the basis that F was the father, she recommended that care and placement orders should be made.  She saw little change in M's behaviour since the older two children left her care. She recorded that M has not attended contact consistently, appears socially isolated and lacking in commitment. She stated that M had not worked honestly and openly with the Local Authority. She considered that there is extensive information about the mother's parenting capacity and that M would not be able to care for LJ adequately.  She filed a position statement prior to the hearing in March in which she stated that she adhered to her recommendations.

 

I heard the IRH which had been listed on Friday 31st January 2014, the working day before the final hearing was due to start. No progress could be made to resolving the case and so the case proceeded for a final hearing commencing on Monday 3rd February 2014.

 

During the course of this hearing I have heard evidence from the following:

 

i)	Ms Karen Singer, the independent social worker. She gave evidence in February.

ii)	Ms White, the Local Authority social worker. She also gave evidence in February.

iii)	M, the mother. She gave evidence in February.

iv)	Ms Gillian Evans � she gave evidence at the hearing in March.

v)	Ms Clutterbuck � the guardian.

Oral evidence � Ms Singer - She adhered to the recommendations expressed in her report. She said that she had not seen anything that suggested that M has dealt with any of the damaging aspects of her own background. She said that the mother's current circumstances are simply not suited to the care of a child; her accommodation is poor, she has no support and she is a vulnerable young woman.

 

Ms Singer plainly had difficulty with the withdrawal of the allegations at the fact finding hearing and understanding the binary system upon which the court operates. She was plainly troubled in her evidence about the uncertainty that she thought remained as to whether the mother had continued in affectionate communication with F. Once the binary system had been explained to her and she had been asked to set aside her concerns about any continuing relationship with F, she said that she would still remain very concerned about the mother caring for LJ. She thought that there was a significant risk that the mother and F might later resume their relationship and she also stressed her view that there has been a lack of emotional development of the mother since the time of the report of Dr Radford.

 

As to the first point (the risk of resumption of the relationship) it was put to Ms Singer that the mother had sought and obtained a non molestation order against F on 17th April 2013 and that there was no evidence to support the suggested risk of a resumption of the relationship. Ms Singer remained concern about the volatility of F and thought that even a legal order might not restrain him from interfering with the mother's care of LJ if he were to be returned to her care. On what I have heard I think that there is very little chance of the mother and F getting back together. I do think that there is a strong likelihood that he would be as destructive as M herself suggests if LJ were to be returned to her.

 

As to the second point (the lack of emotional development since the report of Dr Radford), she did not accept that the mother had developed in a way that would allow her to care for LJ. She did not accept that the mother's development is demonstrated by the absence of a relationship with F since April. It was put to her that the absence of a relationship shows a development in her maturity as her past involvement in abusive relationships was a very strong feature of her background. Ms Singer did not accept that this signalled the end of M's vulnerability or her past tendency to form damaging relationships. The absence of relationships is also a feature of the mother's isolation.

 

Ms Singer also did not accept that M's suggested involvement in the Freedom Programme was a sufficient signal of progress. I heard a lot of speculative evidence about the mother's participation in this Programme; nobody had approached those running the Programme to gather their views. It is then that I required them to do so and had difficulty understanding why this had not been done. I have already stated the result of the enquiry.

 

Ms Singer accepted that M is making weekly bids for alternative accommodation but foresaw difficulties in achieving a transfer. The housing department regards her current accommodation as sufficient. She thought that the mother's asthma was a factor that should be taken into account. Ms Singer said: 'if someone is feeling depressed, is isolated, has breathing difficulties, is feeling troubled with the history there has been, it is a matter of concern'.

 

Ms Singer said that she thought that a foster placement for mother and LJ would be highly likely to break down and would be very unsettling for LJ. It would involve removing him from the environment in which he is now settled and putting him into a placement in which he would be highly unlikely to remain.

 

As to contact, Ms Singer did not think that it was understandable that the mother missed contact. She did not think that the depression from which the mother was suffering at the time explained this. It was put to her that the contact notes suggest that she is a mother who is attuned to her child's needs even when LJ was fractious. She said that she accepted that this was the position 'during contact'.

 

She said that the key to the mother caring for LJ would be whether she had sufficient support. She said that her fundamental worry is that the mother would turn to unsuitable partners and unsuitable family members, as she has done in the past. She said that her thinking began on the basis that of Dr Radford's report and the opinion that it would take years for the mother to have the emotional maturity to care for a child. She said that she did not see any evidence of the mother having matured beyond the level identified by Dr Radford in a way that would allow her to care for LJ.

 

Overall, Ms Singer's assessment and evidence was entirely negative in relation to any prospect of M caring for LJ. She closed down every issue that was put to her on behalf of M.

 

Ms White � She has been the allocated social worker throughout these proceedings. She said that F would not engage with the Local Authority at all to begin with. When he did attend it was necessary to have security. He was highly charged and emotionally distressed.

 

She said that she remains concerned about the people with whom M may associate given her previous partners and family connections. She said that the contact is generally very good. M is intuitive and playful with LJ and they 'interact very well' when together. Ms White thought that the main concern is the emotional instability and disconnection that M can show. She gave an example of the contact in August when LJ was teething and M did not quieten him. 

 

Ms White did not think that M would have insight into LJ's distress if he needed comforting. Ms White then said that this aspect of concern (the disconnection between mother and child during contact) is improving, however. Each of the contact records since 21st October 2013 records the mother as behaving with warmth and appropriate affection to LJ. 

 

Ms White said that, initially, M responded very well to the parenting work that she did with her. But, Ms White said, if she tried to touch on any issues with depth, M tended not to engage. She found that it was very difficult to talk to M about her past because she dissociates with her background (as Dr Radford observed). She did not consider that M acts honestly if important events occurred; I accept that is so (e.g. on the basis of her evidence about the Freedom Programme).

 

Ms White said that she does hold out hope for the mother as a parent in the long term future. However, until she has addressed the difficulties of her past she cannot parent adequately. The fact that M has not been in a relationship for ten months (save possibly for a week with a man called J) does make a difference she said, but would not be sufficient for the Local Authority to change its mind.

 

She said that it is the mother's emotional instability and vulnerability that are the main reasons why the Local Authority would not support her as a carer of LJ. If rehabilitation were to be attempted Ms White thought that, initially M would care for him adequately but that she would not be able to sustain this.

 

Ms White said that she noted a change in M when she appeared depressed in October and advised her to go to see her GP. Ms White accepted that the GP found her to be depressed and to have low iron levels. She said that she accepted that the mother's ill-health had an impact on contact. Ms White said that it was in November that she received information from a colleague suggesting that the mother was associating with an unsuitable man called J P; M accepts that she had a relationship with Mr P for a week but did not continue with him because he was a 'player' who was not prepared to commit. Ms White surmised that this may also have had an impact on her attendance at contact. M denies that she had a relationship with another man, called RC, who she described as 'a dirty crack head'. There is no evidence to support any suggestion of a relationship with that man.

 

Ms White said that she thinks that there is a residual risk of unstable relationships. She based that on the history of her relationships with JB, BW and F and also the mother's relationship with Mr P. Ms White said that the mother still 'hangs around' with the same people.

 

If LJ did return to the mother, she would need to attend the Freedom Programme. Available to her also would be parenting education. She said that, if a mother and baby foster placement was considered, it would have to be out of the city in which the mother lives. 

 

Ms White said that she thinks that there is no solution other than adoption for LJ. She said that LJ is the mother's third child. She does not have the maturity or emotional ability to care for him adequately.

 

M � She said that she has seen JB about three times since the case started in April. She saw him in court and bumped into him twice in a pub, she said. She said that she has bumped into BW in the street a few times; on one occasion she ended up smacking him and as a result was charged with assault.

 

Since last April, she has had no involvement with F, she said. She said that she speaks to his mother on the phone and has bumped into his sister in the street. She said that she does not know where F is living.

 

She said that she would not allow her mother to stay with her after the events when she made a suicide attempt. She said that she has very little contact with her mother (who, she said, is working all the time with people who have learning difficulties). M said that she looks to her friends for support; she spends much of her time with a particular female friend, LE, who is a mother who cares for her own children.

 

In her evidence in February she said that she has attended the Freedom Programme on three occasions before Christmas and three or four occasions since. She said that the records of Freedom Programme may show that she has only attended three times in total but that this is explained by the registration process. She said that she has learnt a great deal from her attendance there and would like to do more parenting work. She did not think that counselling would be of benefit to her because, she said, she does not remember the bad things about her childhood.

 

She said that she would be willing to go to a placement out of her home city. F is a risk, but a placement on the other side of the city would be sufficiently safe she thought. 

 

When the case resumed I stated that I thought that there were issues that the mother needed to address in formal evidence. However, despite adjournments and arrangements that were offered in court, the mother's distress was so great that she was unable to give further evidence and, after asking for assistance from the bar, I was told that it was agreed by everyone that there should be no further attempt at gaining oral evidence from her. The main topics that would have been covered were these:

 

i)	Why had she not told the truth abut the Freedom Programme and was there any validity in her suggested reasons for not attending?

ii)	What had occurred between herself and F in the public house (C175) and afterwards. What level of threats was he making to her by Facebook, text and other means? Ms Flexman told me that it is accepted that F is very hostile to M to the extent that, if she did care for LJ, she would have to move from this area and would have to keep LJ protected from him.

iii)	What had happened about the GP notes and why had the mother not taken the initiative in getting those notes knowing of the order that I made in February?

iv)	What was her involvement when F was threatening to abduct Chd2 to Ireland (the guardian wished to hear evidence on this her solicitor having not cross examined the mother at the February hearing);

v)	What did occur between the mother and Mr J P?

Ms Evans - She thought that the mother's insecure attachment style would impact upon her parenting. It is likely that that impact would be reflected in difficulties with showing warmth and emotional continuity both as a parent and an adult. She thought that this is reflected in the mother's history both as an adult and as a child. M has sought to deal with this by isolating herself from her family with the result that she is very isolated and has not been able to build up a network of support and has become dependent on one friendship with 'LE', who is aged 20. This may change in time but change has not yet been effected. 

 

Ms Evans said that, in her work with M, M seemed to be searching for a mother figure � she said that she saw how the mother even turned to the contact supervisor for emotional support. Ms Evans tied this in with her opinion that there was a reasonably positive prognosis that the mother would succeed in a residential setting because she might well find the sort of emotional support that she seeks; she also tied it in with her opinion that the mother would not be able to care for LJ adequately in the community. She did not think that a mother and baby foster placement could offer her the type of support in the community or with the enduring mother figure that M sought. 

 

She recognised that, in the right placement, educational and supportive facilities (such as parenting groups) could be made available to help the mother develop supportive connections. However, she did not see sufficient commitment to change for her to consider that M could make the necessary changes within the timescale of LJ. Further, it would require her to be open and honest with professionals and that has not been a feature of the past.

 

The guardian -  She adhered to her recommendation that care and placement orders should be made. She said that there is no other possible outcome that would be consistent with LJ's welfare. Her recommendation is not a matter of fine balance but represents the only solution that could be achieved in LJ's interests. She had some misgivings about whether the mother would be able to cope in a mother and baby foster placement (bearing in mind the difficulties that arose with the two older children when this was tried). However, she did not challenge Ms Evans view and said that such a placement might succeed. She felt that the mother would be very unlikely to be able to care for LJ in the community at the end of such a mother and baby foster placement. 

 

Welfare considerations � I now turn to the legal considerations relating to welfare.

 

Where, on applications for care orders such as this, the threshold criteria are fulfilled in relation to any given child (as is the case here), it is necessary to consider the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and section 1 of the Children Act 1989 when deciding whether to make the care order sought. Where there is an application for a placement order before the court the court must conduct a global, holistic approach to welfare issues weighing up the various available options before it. As part of that holistic approach the court must conduct the welfare analysis in relation to the placement application by considering the terms of section 52 (1)(b) and section 1 of the Adoption and Child Act 2002. The welfare checklist in the 1989 Act is not the same as the checklist in the 2002 Act. 

 

In Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, paras 49-50 MacFarlane LJ said: "In most child care cases a choice will fall to be made between two or more options. The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option�The linear approach � is not apt where the judicial task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for the child's future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare."

 

The Court of Appeal has given guidance about the importance of applying the statutory factors in the 1989 and 2002 Acts. The guidance is to be found, for instance, in the case of EH v Greenwich [2010] EWCA Civ 344. I set out in full the relevant passage from the judgment of the late Baron J:

 





61. The judge was making a very draconian order. As such, he was required to balance each factor within the checklist in order to justify his conclusions and determine whether the final outcome was appropriate. Accordingly, because this analysis is entirely absent, his failure to mention the provisions of the Children Act and deal with each part of Section 1 (3) undermines his conclusions and his orders.







The Judge did not mention Article 8 of the ECHR. The terms of that Article provide that[ Baron J then set out Article 8 which I will set out below] 







67. In the case of Re P [2008] EWCA Civ 535 Wall LJ stated: -There is, perhaps, no more important or far-reaching decision for a child than to be adopted by strangers" �"Judges approaching the question of dispensation under the section must, it seems to us, ask themselves the question to which section 52 (1) (b) of the 2002 Act gives rise, and answer it by reference to section 1 of the same Act, and in particular by a careful consideration of all matters identified in section 1(4)�.. 







"�the best guidance which in our judgment this court can give is to advise Judges to apply the statutory language with care to the facts of the particular case. The message is no doubt, prosaic, but the best guidance, we think, is as simple and as straightforward as that."







68. The precise terms of the section which provides [the learned Judge then set out the provisions of section 1(4) of the Act, which I cite in full later];







69. The judge should have turned his mind to each of these provisions and not truncated his considerations as set out above. By so doing he specifically failed to address these children's particular needs and the likely effect on them (throughout their lives) of their ceasing to be a member of their original family. They have an established attachment to a loving mother who, with targeted assistance, might be able to provide some form of future mothering'.



Compliant with that case, I cite Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides. It states that: '1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society �for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.' 

 

Care orders amount to a very significant invasion of the rights encapsulated within Article 8(1). Placement orders amount to an even more significant invasion of that right than care orders. For such orders to be justified they must satisfy the provisions of Article 8(2) and therefore must be: a) in accordance with the law (here the Convention compliant Children Act 1989); b) necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms (i.e. welfare) of others (i.e. the child) and c) proportionate. There is no conflict between Article 8 and Section 1 of the 1989 Act � Dawson v Wearmouth [1999] 2 AC 308 and Payne v Payne [2001] 1 FCR 425.

 

The determination of whether the threshold criteria are fulfilled involves considering the position at the time that protective measures were taken (here, when the proceedings started). By contrast, welfare issues must be based on the totality of information available to the court and, unlike threshold issues, it is necessary to conduct a contemporary evaluation of what is best for the child concerned. 

 

Thus, in making welfare decisions I have to apply section 1 (1) of the Children Act 1989 in relation to the care application and section 1(2) of The Adoption and Children Act 2002 in relation to the placement application as well as section 52(1) (b). 

 

By section 1(1) of the 1989 Act the welfare of LJ is the court's paramount consideration. 

 

Section 1(3) of the Act contains the welfare checklist. It provides that, in making welfare decisions in a case such as this, a court must have regard in particular to �

 

(a)	the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of her age and understanding);



(b)	her physical, emotional and educational needs;



(c)	the likely effect on her of any change in her circumstances;



(d)	her age, sex, background and any characteristics of hers which the court considers relevant;



(e)	any harm which she has suffered or is at risk of suffering;



(f)	how capable each of her parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting her needs;



(g)	The range of powers available to the court under the Act.



The 2002 Act � Children may not be placed for adoption under placement orders without the consent of the parents unless "the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with" (section 52(1) (b) Adoption and Children Act 2002). The core statutory provisions in relation to placement orders are therefore sections 52 and 1 for the purposes of this judgment (although there are of course many other provisions in the Act relating to such orders).

 

The case of Re P (children) (adoption: parental consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2FCR 185 provides useful guidance in relation to applications for placement orders. The main and relevant principles for these purposes are set out in paragraphs 119 to 154 of the judgment of Wall LJ. Those principles are summarised in the case of EH v Greenwich [2010] EWCA Civ 344. I wish to mention the following three points that arise from Re P (although I have considered the case as a whole):

 



i)	In considering the provisions of section 52 I must consider section 1(4) of the 2002 Act (as explained in EH v Greenwich);



ii)	The word 'requires' in section 52 is 'plainly chosen as best conveying the essence of the Strasbourg jurisprudence'. That is, it implies an imperative rather than something that is merely optional or desirable;



iii)	Section 1(4) of the 2002 Act is not the same as section 1(3) of the 1989 Act. The welfare checklists are different in several important respects, especially s 1(4)(c) and (f). The court should therefore work through section 1(4) of the 2002 Act when considering whether to make a placement order.



Ryder LJ summarised the position in the case of Re R [2013] EWCA Civ 1018: 'So far as section 52 of the 2002 Act is concerned, the judge had to be satisfied that the welfare of each of the children required their parents' consent to be dispensed with. In other words, their welfare necessitates adoption and nothing else short of that will do. That formulation is derived from the terms of section 52 as explained by this court in Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2 FLR 625 CA at paragraphs 113 to 119 inclusive and, most recently as reiterated by the Supreme Court In the matter of B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33'.

 



The relevant parts of Section 1 of the 2002 Act provide as follows (I have not included ss 5):

 

(1)	This section applies whenever a court or adoption agency is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child.



(2)	The paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency must be the child's welfare, throughout his life.



(3)	The court or adoption agency must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to the decision is likely to prejudice the child's welfare.



(4)	The court or adoption agency must have regard to the following matters (among others)�



(a)	the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision (considered in the light of the child's age and understanding),



(b)	the child's particular needs,



(c)	the likely effect on the child (throughout her life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,



(d)	the child's age, sex, background and any of the child's characteristics which the court or agency considers relevant,



(e)	any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering,



(f)	the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, including�



(i)	the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so,



(ii)	the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child's needs,



(iii)	the wishes and feelings of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child.

(5)	�

(6)	The court or adoption agency must always consider the whole range of powers available to it in the child's case (whether under this Act or the Children Act 1989); and the court must not make any order under this Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so.

(7)	In this section, "coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child", in relation to a court, includes�

(a)	coming to a decision in any proceedings where the orders that might be made by the court include an adoption order (or the revocation of such an order), a placement order (or the revocation of such an order) or an order under section 26 (or the revocation or variation of such an order),

(b)	coming to a decision about granting leave in respect of any action (other than the initiation of proceedings in any court) which may be taken by an adoption agency or individual under this Act,

but does not include coming to a decision about granting leave in any other circumstances.

(8) 	For the purposes of this section�

(a)	references to relationships are not confined to legal relationships,

(b)	references to a relative, in relation to a child, include the child's mother and father.



It is of fundamental importance that there is discipline in the approach to welfare issues in care and placement proceedings. The court is not a court of social engineering. The court does not decide welfare issues by considering whether, on an individual judge's analysis, a child might be considered to be 'better off' in care or adoption. Thus the court must not approach a case such as this by asking whether, on balance, a given child would be better off with adopters or with a parent. The dicta that I have already set out from Re B-S (and which have their basis in the judgments of Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Neuberger in Re B [2013] UKSC 33) must be applied. For myself I find the passages from the judgment of Lord Neuberger in paragraphs 77 and 78 of particular assistance. They include the following at paragraph 77:  'It seems to me to be inherent in section 1(1) that a care order should be a last resort, because the interests of a child would self-evidently require her relationship with her natural parents to be maintained unless no other course was possible in her interests. That is reinforced by the requirement in section 1 (3)(g) that the court must consider all options, which carries with it the clear implication that the most extreme option should only be adopted if others would not be in her interests'. 

 

Although care proceedings are quasi inquisitorial (see Re W [2013] EWCA Civ 1227), it is for the Local Authority to justify its applications and to substantiate its proposed care measures on evidence � P, C and S v United Kingdom [2002] 2 FLR 631. 

 

Fostering / adoption � Although there is no suggestion that long fostering presents itself as an option for LJ, I want to reinforce this by recording the words of Black LJ in the case of Re V [2013] EWCA Civ 913 where she said:

 



[95] My difficulty with that is that I do not think that fostering and adoption can, in fact, be equated in terms of what they offer by way of security. I do not intend to embark on a comprehensive comparison of the two arrangements, merely to highlight some of the material differences. What I say should not be taken as a substitute for professional advice to the court from social services and/or the guardian in any case in which this is a significant issue. 





[96].�With that caveat, I make the following observations:



i)	Adoption makes the child a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he or she fully belongs. To the child, it is likely therefore to "feel" different from fostering. Adoptions do, of course, fail but the commitment of the adoptive family is of a different nature to that of a local authority foster carer whose circumstances may change, however devoted he or she is, and who is free to determine the caring arrangement. 



ii)	Whereas the parents may apply for the discharge of a care order with a view to getting the child back to live with them, once an adoption order is made, it is made for all time. 



iii)	Contact in the adoption context is also a different matter from contact in the context of a fostering arrangement. Where a child is in the care of a local authority, the starting point is that the authority is obliged to allow the child reasonable contact with his parents (section 34(1) Children Act 1989). The contact position can, of course, be regulated by alternative orders under section 34 but the situation still contrasts markedly with that of an adoptive child. There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the adoption order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.� 



iv)	Routine life is different for the adopted child in that once he or she is adopted, the local authority have no further role in his or her life (no local authority medicals, no local authority reviews, no need to consult the social worker over school trips abroad, for example).

Placement with the mother � positives - Consistent with the above principles of law the best place for LJ to live is with his mother if this can possibly be achieved in a way that is consistent with his welfare. His mother loves him and wants to care for him. He would maintain his natural identity and would grow up as a member of his natural family. Thus he would be in his natural environment. He might be able to develop a relationship with his half siblings Chd1 and Chd2. If F matures it might be possible in later life for LJ to know his father; he would at least be able to form his own views of his father based on information that M would be able to provide to him.

 

Adoption � Of course adoption would mean that LJ would find a new loving home with people who had chosen to offer a young child the opportunity of a carefully selected family and home environment. Adoption offers a child security and stability which other kinds of care measure, such as fostering, do not. Through deliberate and heartfelt choice adopters offer themselves as carers for children. It is highly likely that there would be no difficulty in finding LJ an adoptive placement if decisions are made now. Developmentally he is still at an age where he could integrate emotionally and psychologically within an adoptive family.

 

Notwithstanding those positive aspects of adoption they do not in any way invade the principles of law that I have stated and the primacy of natural placement where possible.

 

Core reasoning � why placement with the mother is not possible. I list the following core reasons why placement of LJ with his mother is not possible in a way that is consistent with his welfare:

 

i)	Past and present psychological assessment suggests that M would not be able to care for LJ adequately. Those assessments are sound and solid. I was very impressed with the evidence of Ms Evans and accept it.

ii)	Social work and guardian assessment is to the same effect. The social work assessments of Ms White and Ms Singer have been affected by the wrong approach to the fact finding issues. However, that heavy qualification does not affect the guardian's very firm recommendations. Welfare issues are for me alone to decide. However, I regard the guardian's analysis to be entirely correct and properly researched. She gave evidence that was kind, thorough and professional.

iii)	Attempts for the mother to care for her two older children were lengthy, detailed and highly supportive. Every effort was made to keep those two children with the mother. Those efforts failed in 2012, the year before LJ's birth. It is highly likely that the same would occur with LJ if he were to be placed with his mother. 

iv)	The mother remains isolated and vulnerable. She shows only some limited signs of maturation. She appears to have responded to the difficulties of her past by isolating herself further both from professionals and her other social connections (save for her one friend, LE). That isolation is also reflected in her non attendance at contact and, thus, in her performance as a mother to LJ. I accept that she has been depressed but that has led her to log out as a mother as well.

v)	Under the extreme burden of her difficulties, the mother has not been able to show any sustained commitment to change. She has avoided any sustained relationships with inappropriate men but that is also a signal of the extent of her isolation. Her non attendance with the Freedom programme is a particularly clear sign of how she has not been able to commit herself to effecting supported changes. I also note the limited engagement of the mother with the after care work of Ms Lemke-Elms. It is highly likely that M would not have sufficient emotional resources to achieve the necessary commitment now.

vi)	The prospects of the mother removing herself from her current environment and starting afresh in an entirely new and protective environment in which she established a way of life where she cared for LJ adequately is so remote as to be profoundly unrealistic. It would isolate her even further and would be a wretched existence for her.

vii)	In her current environment she would be unable to care for LJ safely or adequately. One only has to picture what would happen if this young baby were to be with the mother now to identify how impossible an arrangement that would be. The mother would not engage in services that were offered and would not have the emotional or organisation resources to care for him in her isolated lifestyle. Further F would represent a dangerous and destructive feature of any such arrangement and the hostility that he bears would be such as to make her life and care of LJ highly problematic and vulnerable. There is a continuing hostility between F and M that lead to events such as those that occurred in the public house [C175, which I say based only on M's account of this and not on F's controversial and untested contentions to the social worker].

viii)	LJ's age, the facts of this case and the duration of these proceedings all combine to mean that it would be thoroughly irresponsible and entirely unnecessary for further assessment of the mother to be directed. M might well respond positively in the short term to a mother and baby foster placement but it is highly improbable that she would be able to care for LJ in the community in the foreseeable future.

ix)	The only relevant services that might be provided on the facts of this case are: a) a mother and baby foster placement where there was a very high level of supervision and involvement by the foster carers and the Local Authority and then b) a supported placement in the environment (at that point with a range of community based services). The Local Authority has identified now, somewhat belatedly, what might be provided. So the services are there if the correct solution is to use them. It is very clear indeed that such a structure of services would not meet LJ's welfare.  With Chd1 and Chd2 matters did not progress beyond the mother and baby foster placement stage. It is very unlikely indeed that the mother would engage in services in the community (and again I refer to how she did not engage in the Freedom Programme despite knowing its importance) and it is highly unlikely that she would find a lifestyle within the community that met the demands of motherhood.

x)	It is very difficult indeed to identify what is happening in this mother's life given her non engagement, isolation and untruthfulness. An example of the latter was the seriously untruthful evidence that she gave about attendance at the Freedom Programme (giving evidence of how much she had gained from it). The truth about her non attendance this year was only revealed after I said that I wanted to hear from the Programme about the progress that the mother had made there and the level of her attendance. This would make it very difficult for there to be sustained and effective support of the mother in the community. 

Welfare check analysis � LJ is too young for his wishes and feelings to be ascertained. For reasons that I have stated, his mother cannot meet his needs and there is no realistic prospect of her doing so within his timescales. His circumstances must change and the only two options for change are rehabilitation to his mother or placement for adoption. Rehabilitation to his mother is manifestly contrary to his interests for the core reasons that I have set out. He is of an age and background that mean that he must now find a permanent home. Further delay cannot be permitted and he cannot be left in interim foster carer any longer; he has already formed attachments to his carers that, sadly, will now have to be broken. He would suffer grave harm if returned to the care of his mother; his emotional and physical needs would not be met and he would be living in an isolated and very vulnerable environment with a mother who could not meet the organisational demands of motherhood. His mother does not have the capability to care for him adequately and will not acquire that capability in a timescale that is compatible with his needs.  Under The Children Act 1989 the only order that could be made consistently with his welfare is a care order.

 

I turn to the checklist in the 2002 Act. In relation to sections 1(4) (a) [wishes and feelings], (b) [needs], (d) [age, sex, background and characteristics] and (e) [harm and risk of harm] I refer to the matters that I have already outlined above. It is in sections 1 (4) (c) and (f) that the welfare checklists in the two Acts are markedly different.

 

For LJ, the effect of ceasing to be a member of his original family and becoming an adopted person will mean that he losses his place within his natural family for life. That is a very major step to take and requires consideration of the long term as well as the short term. There is a magnetism between any individual and his natural origins (which is why adults often like to trace their ancestry so that they understand about themselves). Adopted people may often want to trace their natural families because of the sense of loss and lack of fundamental identity that they may feel. I have thought very carefully about those features of adoption when deciding this case. However, balanced against that is the fact that placement with the mother will not meet his needs in the short or long term and would be very emotionally damaging to him. That being so, how could it be in his interests for him to live in the emotionally isolating and vulnerable environment that the mother would offer him? The long term damage that would arise from placement with the mother would be profound and certain. In the short term, quite simply, he would be a young child whose emotional and physical needs were not met. Thus the effect of him becoming an adopted person is to protect him from that harmful upbringing and to offer him the chance of a place within an adopted family that will love him and care for him by choice following careful selection. 

 

As to section 1(4)(f) there is only one person within the natural family that might care for him � that person is M. If she cared for him he would have a very limited involvement with any of his other relatives. M wishes to avoid F and her own family. M's wish to care for him is natural, genuine and deeply felt. However, she is unable to offer him the upbringing that he deserves and needs. Although her love for him is genuine she does not have the emotional ability to commit herself to caring for him (and so, for instance, has been unable to commit herself to attending contact even on a weekly basis and could not commit to the Freedom Programme which she knew was important in her bid to care for him).

 

In the circumstances, I am driven to conclude that I must make a care order in relation to LJ. I conclude that LJ's welfare requires that I dispense with the consent of M (and, insofar as may be necessary F) to him being placed for adoption in accordance with Section 52(1)(b) of the 2002 Act. I make a placement order in relation to him.

 

I deeply regret the very deep pain that this decision will cause to M. I have striven at this hearing to examine every issue in such depth and with such care as I can muster. I hope that she will be able to hear that, if she takes help, she may well be able to parent a child successfully in the future. I do implore her to take that help now and see it through well before she thinks about any question of having any further children. Her damaging upbringing is no fault of hers. As her legal team will know this court has made a lot of effort to ensure that links exist with caring agencies who will offer support to parents who have gone through the very distressing processes of public law litigation. Nobody is more worthy of that personal support than M and I would ask her legal team to ensure that she is aware of how to find it.

JUDGMENT




1.       
This case concerns
a child (C) who was born on 31st July 2013.� Her father is H (the
father).� Her mother is O (the mother).

2.    This is a fact finding hearing and
hearing as to Threshold.� The local authority�s case is set out in the Revised
Schedule of Proposed Findings dated 16th February 2014.� The
principle allegations are:

(a)    C suffered fractures of the 11th
and 12th right ribs.� According to Dr. Halliday the rib fractures occurred
between 30th September and 28th October 2013 which is
prior to C�s removal by the father from the mother;

(b)    Fractures to the right radius and
ulna. According to Dr. Halliday the arm fractures were most likely to have been
caused between the 4th and 7th November 2013 which is
after C had been removed by the father.� It is accepted by Dr. Halliday that
dating fractures is an inexact science but the doctor is clear that the rib
fractures are older than the arm fractures.� There were therefore two episodes
of injury.� 

(c)    An unexplained abrasion of the right
forearm.�� �

 

3.    Chronology:� The mother who comes from China arrived in the   UK on 6th March 2103.� The parents married on 8th
April.� The mother alleged that shortly before the marriage ceremony the father
assaulted the mother by slapping her. 

4.    On 31st July 2013 C was
born.� C and her parents moved to live with the paternal grandparents.

5.    In October there were two incidents
involving C.� The first was when C was in her Matrix Light II car seat/cot.� It
was in the upright position in the car.� The father had left the car.� When he
returned the seat was in the flat cot position.� The father put the cot back to
the upright position.� Shortly thereafter there was a click and the straps had
become tangled.

6.    Later in October when C was in the
seat in the car in the upright position the father had to make an emergency
stop.� The straps had tightened as a result of which the parents decided to
carry C in the flat position in the car.� 

7.    On about 15th October the
father travelled to Taiwan and Hong Kong and retuned to UK on 29th October.� His arm was in a brace.� The father was therefore out of
the country during part of the radiological window during which C�s rib
fractures are said to have occurred.

8.    On 31st October C was in
the push chair.� On removing C from the car the father noticed that the straps
were once again tight and bunched.� The father rethreaded them.���� 

9.    �On 2nd November when
returning to the grandparents� home the push chair tilted forward as the
parents were going down some steps to the house.� It is said by the father that
C was caught in the hood material and C�s right arm was trapped and compressed
by the roll/carry bar of the cot.� C fell further to the front of the pram and
to one side.� The father said that C had a small graze on her arm and another
on her head.� The mother said that C slept for 12 hours thereafter as normal
and took also took the right amount of milk.

10. The push chair was available in court.� The father gave a
number of demonstrations of what he said happened at the various incidents.�� 

11. On Sunday 3rd November there was an argument
between the parents.� The father says that the mother began to sob, wail,
scream and cry and also to slap herself around the face and neck. ��The father
asserts that the mother�s bizarre and aggressive behaviour gave concern for her
mental health and posed a risk to C.� The father left the house with C and went
to the house of his former partner, JF, in Southampton.

12. At an earlier stage in the case there was a suggestion on
behalf of the father that JF was a possible perpetrator of C�s
injuries.� That is no longer the position although JF was called as a
witness.

13. The mother says that she was distressed by the father�s
behaviour and that he assaulted her by twisting her neck and forcing down her
head and tried to strangle her.� She sustained a red mark on her neck. ��The
father left with C. He sent the mother an abusive text message and threatened
she would not see C again. �C was out of the mother�s care from 4th
November until 9th November.

14. �On Monday 4th November the father returned to
his parents� home. He was not allowed to remove C�s equipment.� He drove to Newport to arrange for a passport for C.� They both stayed at the Days Inn Hotel.

15. On Tuesday 5th November the father drove with
C back to Southampton and stayed at the Days Inn at Rownhams.� He met JF and their daughter Katelin.

16. On 6th November the father visited JF�s home.� The local police, having been alerted by the Dorset Police,
arrived to check that C was safe and well.� The mother says that the father
sent her a text saying that he intended to take C for a three week holiday to Scotland. 

17. �On 7th November C�s passport arrived by
post.� On 8th November the father took C to the New Forest and
stayed at the Days Inn at Portsmouth.� The father and his parents remained on
non speaking terms.

18. On Saturday 8th November the father took C to Scotland.� Having reached Newcastle he decided to turn back.� He was stopped by the police on
the A1 near Harrogate in the early hours of Saturday morning.� C was taken to Harrogate hospital where she was noted to be distressed and crying uncontrollably.� She had
a swollen right forearm which was tender.� She has limited movement of her
right arm. 

19. The father says that when he was stopped C was moving her
arm normally and did not appear distressed.� She had cried when the father
changed her but that was not unusual.� There was nothing unusual about her
cry.� C put up both hands to grasp her bottle.

20. �Law

21. The local authority must satisfy the court that the
requirements of section 31(2) Children Act are met (The Threshold Criteria).�
In order to do so in this case the local authority seeks to prove a number of
matters. 

22. At the start of the case the local authority alleged that
C�s injuries were inflicted by one or other of the parents. 

23. In order to determine whether a particular person was the
perpetrator of non-accidental injury, the burden of proof rests upon the local
authority and does not shift.� The allegations have to be proved to the civil
standard of proof � Re B Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof)
[2008] UKHL; 2 FLR 141 35 and see Baker J in Re JS [2012] EWHC 1370 (Fam). It must be shown that the alleged incident is more likely to have
occurred than not.� This is otherwise referred to as proving the case on the
balance of probabilities.

24. �Although it is desirable that the court should, if
possible, identify the perpetrator(s) it should not strain to do so � Re
D (Children) [2009] 2 FLR 668, Re SB (Children) [2-10]1
FLR 1161. When a court is seeking to identify the perpetrators of
non-accidental injury the test of whether a particular person is in the pool of
possible perpetrators is whether there is a real possibility that he or she was
the perpetrator. 

25. �It may be that at the conclusion of the evidence in a
case, if the court finds one or both of the injuries to have been inflicted, it
is not possible to identify a single perpetrator. In that event both the
parents remain in the pool of possible perpetrators for one or both of C�s
injuries.

26. In the case of Re B (Above) the House of
Lords explained that neither the seriousness of the allegation nor the
seriousness of the consequences should make any difference to the standard of
proof to be applied in determining the facts.� There is no �heightened
standard� and no legal rule that �the more serious the allegation, the more
cogent the evidence needed to prove it�.

27. Further as was pointed out by Lord Hoffman in Re B
(Above) there is no room for a finding that a fact might have happened.� The
law operates a binary system in which the only values are zero and one.� The
fact either happened or it did not.

28. It is always open to a judge to rule that the cause of an
injury remains unknown � see Hedley J in Re R (Care Proceedings:
Causation) [2011] EWHC 1715.� The court must examine and assess the wide
canvass which is provided by all the evidence- Re U, Re B
(Serious Injury: Standard of Proof) [2004] EWCA Civ 567. ��The evidence of the
parents is very important.� The expert evidence is a part of the evidential
jigsaw and must be weighed against findings on the other evidence. The court
must be careful to avoid speculation, particularly where there is a gap in the
evidence � Re A (A Child) (Fact Finding Hearing: Speculation)
[2011] EWCA Civ 12.

29. The hearing began on 24th February.� It was anticipated
that the evidence at least would have concluded by the end of that week.�
During her oral evidence the mother alleged that the contents of the statement which
she had signed did not accord with the instructions that she had given to her
lawyers. �After considering the position overnight her counsel and solicitors
withdrew from the case.

30. Thereafter counsel for the father in formed the court
that her client no longer wished her to act for him.� Counsel therefore
withdrew from the case.� Consequently the case was adjourned part heard on 26th
February.� When the matter returned for a directions hearing on 8th
April, the parents had each instructed a new legal team.�� There was a further
directions hearing on 1st April when the father applied for permission
to recall JF who had previously given evidence and to submit a
significant number of additional written questions to each of the medical
experts.� 

31. I gave permission for JF to be recalled to answer
two of the questions which the father had included in his request. �

32. By the time of the hearing on 1st April the
father had not filed the statement that should have been filed by 24tth March.
Further I only received the list containing the father�s list of questions for
the doctors just before I came into court.� The list is extensive and I needed
further to consider them.� It seemed likely that in his statement, which was
now due on 3rd April and would be seen by the doctors, the father
might raise a number of the matters which he mentions in his list of additional
questions.� For these reasons I adjourned consideration of the questions.�� In
fact because of an error in Miss Whitby�s office, the additional questions were
nevertheless sent to both doctors.� Professor Wyatt responded. I therefore
decided that it would be unrealistic to refuse or limit Dr. Halliday�s
response.�� �����

33. �Evidence:��� There is a large body of written
evidence and material.� This includes evidence which was submitted in earlier
proceedings.� There are medical and hospital records, and material which has
been disclosed by the police.� There are reports by the jointly instructed
experts, Dr Halliday and Professor Wyatt. I have read the statements of the
parents, and the other witnesses.

34. The first witness was Dr. Halliday.� She gave evidence
via a video link on the first day of the hearing.� Her report at C 2002 is
dated 29th January.

35. �C was found to have suffered the following injuries:

36. Fractures of the 11th and 12th
right ribs.� According to Dr. Halliday the rib fractures occurred between 30th
September and 28th October 3013 which is before the father removed C
from the mother.

37. Fractures to the right radius and the right ulna.�
According tom Dr. Halliday the arm fractures were most likely caused between 4th
and 7th November 2013 which was after the father had removed C. 

38. Unexplained abrasion of the right forearm.

39. Dr. Halliday agreed that that dating fractures is an
inexact science but she was clear that the rib fractures were older than the
fractures of C�s forearm.� There were therefore two episodes of injury. 

40. Before Dr. Halliday gave her oral evidence the father was
also sworn in so that he could demonstrate to the witness and to the court how
he maintained that C�s arm was fractured because of a fault in the design of
the pram.� .

41. As to the mechanism for the arm fractures, the doctor was
sceptical of the father�s suggestion that C�s arm was trapped in the pram.� The
doctor thought that the fabric of the hood would have prevented the arm getting
into a position where it could be trapped and compressed. �It was further put
to the doctor that if a heavy bag of shopping had been hanging on the pram�s
hood, this may have caused the hood to close with a chopping movement on C�s
arm.� �

42. The doctor was of the opinion that considerable force had
been necessary to break both C�s bones in her forearm.� She doubted that either
of the father�s suggestions would produce sufficient force 

43. As to the rib fractures the doctor emphasised that these
are caused by direct pressure which causes leverage over the Spinal Process of
the spine. In her view there is no body of reasonable opinion which supports a
suggestion that such fractures may be caused by pressure to the front.������ 

44. �AT C2009 of her report Dr. Halliday deals with the
timing of the two injuries.� As to the forearm and considering the first X rays
of 9th November, the Doctor estimated that the fractures were less
than 11 days old which suggests that they occurred on or after 31st
October.� Upon considering the nature of the associated soft tissue swelling,
which is the result of damage to the tissue, the doctor reduced the window to 5
days from 9th November.� The doctor agreed that the presence of soft
tissue swelling, which she said was quite marked in this case, is nevertheless a
less precise guide than the healing process of the bone.� 

45. The doctor agreed that a displacement of a bone can
happen after the initial fracture.� This requires more force and therefore more
pain. 

46. There was a further X ray on 11th November.�
From this the doctor felt able to say that the window for the injury which
caused the fractures was likely to be between 4th and 7th
November 2013. �

47. As to the mechanism both the medical experts told the
court that this was likely to have been either a direct blow to the arm, a
direct impact caused by the arm being trapped between two hard surfaces or a
sharp angulation such as may be caused by the child being picked up by one arm.
�

48. As to the father�s demonstration the doctor thought that
if C�s arm had been trapped as the father had said it is possible that the
fractures were caused in that way.� The doctor thought that would be an unusual
mechanism and was not within her experience. 

49. Dr. Halliday reported the rib fractures to be between 2
and 6 weeks old on 11th November 2013.� They therefore occurred
between 30th September and 28th October 2013. ��

50. The doctor pointed out that the rib fractures were
towards the back and low down near to the spine.� The doctor did not accept the
father�s explanation.� She said that fractures which occurred at this site
carried a strong association with squeezing of the chest. In such a situation
the ribs are levered against the spine.� In the doctor�s opinion accidental
injuries to the ribs occur generally at the side of the body.

51. �The doctor agreed that someone who was not present at
the time a fracture happened but later simply saw an unhappy child would not
know that the child had sustained a fracture.

52. �The next witness was Professor Wyatt.� He gave evidence
from the witness box having listened to Dr. Halliday.� His report is dated 8th
February at C2013.

53. As to the timing of the injuries he deferred to Dr.
Halliday.� The professor�s expertise consisted in commenting upon C�s clinical
presentation.� In his opinion C�s presentation at hospital on 9th
November is consistent with the radiological timing.� The clinical signs of
particular relevance [J9010] were that the right arm was swollen and tender and
had limited movement. Further at J9045 it is recorded that C was �unsettled and
crying ++� which the professor thought suggested a prolonged period of upset. It
was striking to the professor that there is a marked discrepancy between the
father�s description of C up the point of admission to hospital and the
observations of her distress in hospital. The professor did not think that
anxiety caused by C�s separation from her father accounted for the distress
particular if one took into account the clinical signs. 

54. It is right to point out that the father�s description of
C on 6th November moving her arm normally and putting both hands to
the bottle is not consistent with the occurrence of a recent fracture. �In his
experience limited movement is generally accepted as a sign of a fracture in
the affected limb.� A patient will try to keep the limb still to reduce pain
which will be localised to the one affected limb. The regular administration of
calpol would to some extent also reduce the pain.� It is not possible for the
Professor to say from these clinical signs if the injury was accidental or not.
�In the case of a non-ambulant child such an injury is more likely to be the
result of non accidental injury.

55. There are three possibilities:� accidental injury caused
by trauma, inflicted non accidental injury as the result of trauma or a
fracture the principal cause of which is an underlying bone problem.� The
latter was not likely to be a relevant consideration in this case although the
father had at some stage been investigated because of concern that he might
have suffered from reduced bone density.

56. �The professor did not think that the father�s
explanations were a likely cause of either the arm or the rib injuries. If so
they would be the result of very unusual freak accidents. It is right to bear
in mind that such things do happen. Having, however, seen the father�s
demonstration with the pram hood, the professor could not see how C�s arm could
get into the right position for it to be squashed. He pointed out that prams of
this sort are very carefully designed. There is no record of either set of fractures
to have been caused as the father has suggested.� 

57. �As to the rib fractures the professor said that these
are generally less painful than long bone fractures.�� At the moment that such
a fracture occurred the person holding the child would have been aware that
something had happened.� The child would cry, settle but tend thereafter to be
fractious. ��

58. �JF made a statement to the police on 14th
November 2013 [8090].� Following that statement she had only spoken to the
father on two occasions, the last being in late November.� She lived with the
father for a period which ended about 6 years ago. She had found him to be
controlling and it was difficult to stand up to him. Miss JF described that
his daughter Katelin loved the father and that he had undertaken much of her
care.� His contact with Katelin went well.

59. At about 7 pm on Sunday 3rd November she had
received a telephone call from the father.� As I understand it Miss JF had
seen the father and C for lunch on that Sunday. She saw no reason to be
concerned for C. 

60. During the telephone conversation the father asked to
borrow Miss JF�s car.� No mention was made of C in the telephone call.� Miss
JF drove from her home to Bournemouth, collected the father who stayed the
night at her house.� The father later told her that he was worried for C�s
safety.� Either on the Sunday or Monday (4th November) the father
said he was concerned about C�s arm although that is not mentioned in Miss
JF�s police statement.� At some point he also mentioned an incident when the
father may have said that C had fallen out of her pram on Saturday 2nd
November and had hurt her head and arm.� He had also mentioned that there had
been difficulties with the car seat and that a wheel had fallen off the pram. 

61. On Monday 4th the police arrived at Miss
JF�s house as she was leaving to take her mother to the doctor.

62. �On Tuesday 5th November the father and C left Miss
JF�s home at lunchtime having stayed for the night.� C was well and not
showing any distress during the morning.� The father had not said anything
about C receiving medication.�� When Miss JF held C she settled with her
right side towards Miss JF�s body.� The father spoke of spending a few days
away with C.� He left with C to arrange for to have a passport.� Miss JF saw
them both again at a hotel on Wednesday 6th.� She was alone with C
for about 20 minutes while C as asleep.� She did not see them on Thursday 7th.

63. On Friday 8th November C�s passport arrived by
post at Miss JF�s house.� She later gave it to the father in a car park.

64. Miss JF was asked about the way in which the father
handled C.� She described his manner as very confident.� She agreed with her
statement at I8100 where she described Father�s handling as �quite roughly,
firmly�.� It also seemed to Miss JF that the father thought that C was
acting deliberately if C did not feed as he expected her to.� She saw no
difference in the way he handled C between 3rd and 7th
November.� �

65. �The father had told her that after he
had returned from China he felt there was no bond between him and C.� He told
her of times when the mother lost control of herself.

66. �When the �hearing
resumed on 8th April an application had been made by the father�s
new counsel to recall JF.� I gave limited permission for JF to
be asked further questions on behalf of the father.

67. �JF said that on Sunday 3rd November
she took 5 or 6 photographs of C on that Sunday and others in the period up to
7th November.� JF confirmed that C appeared to favour being
held by JF with C�s right side towards JF�s body.� The father
had mentioned to her a possible difficulty with C�s left arm when C was lying
on the bed. JF could not see that there was a difficulty but told the father
that if he was worried he should take steps to have the matter checked. She had
no recollection of a conversation with the father in the hall of her house on
the Monday about C�s arm. ���I thought that Miss JF was a reliable witness. ��

68. The mother first gave evidence on 25th
February. She had the help of an interpreter in Mandarin. She has been together
with C in a mother and baby placement since 7th January.� She has
not seen father since 5th November except at court. During her oral
evidence the mother said that much of statement at B1033 did not accord with
her instructions. �She said that the grandfather went through the draft
statement with her, became angry and forced her to sign it.� Having heard the
grandfather about this, I do not accept the Mother�s account about. I think the
mother was upset and very confused.� I do not think that the grandfather should
have been put into this position.� He did his best to help.� She said that she
was given blank forms to sign. She was also concerned about the contents of her
police statement at I 8057 and the transcript of the interview at I 8214.�
During her evidence she was taken through those documents and corrected parts
of them. It later became clear that the mother�s solicitors and counsel were in
professional difficulties and requested permission to withdraw.

69. While in the witness box on 25th February the
mother said that she had never seen the father throw C in the air and catch
her.� The mother had not done so.� On 3rd November she thought that
C looked unwell.� She had a cold and was teething.� She was given calpol and
bonjella.

70. She did not see C between 3rd and 8th
November which covers the period during which the doctors think that the arm
fractures probably happened.� As to the rib fractures the mother could give no
explanation.� She had not seen C cry when held around the chest although there
were times when she feared the father held C too tightly. 

71. As to the push chair the mother agreed that there were
difficulties with it.� There were a few incidents in the car when C cried. C
was never comfortable in it when in the upright position.� 

72. On 2nd November when she, C and the father
returned to the grandparents house, the father would not let her help carry the
pram down the steps but told her to go ahead and open the door. It was dark. �She
did not see what happened but a heard a loud bang. C cried.� The pram was
leaning against the wall and the hood was half up.� She could not see if C was
trapped in the pram.� The father did not tell her then or later over the
weekend that C�s arm was had been trapped.� C fed normally and slept for 12
hours.�� 

73. �The mother said that the F had told her a number of lies
about himself.� The father later admitted this in his oral evidence.� The
mother said that the father had made up stories about buying an expensive
house, having been a spy and having obtained a PHD in the USA which was funded by the FBI.�� He never told her that he suspected her of working for
the Chinese intelligence agencies. �

74. �The mother described the occasion when the parents were
staying in Wales and the father slapped her face.� She described another
occasion when she said that the father gripped her throat � I 8150.� ��She said
that sometimes the father has a problem with controlling his anger.� The mother
later in her evidence admitted that on one occasion she had bitten the father�s
hand because he had his hand over her mouth.� The mother agreed that on the
Sunday morning when she was very upset and not well she had slapped herself on
the face.� 

75. She was referred to the text message (I 8149) which she
received from the father during the afternoon of 3rd November.� She
described it as hurtful.� I agree. It contains a threat that the mother will
never see C again. 

76. When the hearing resumed on 8th April the
mother returned to the witness box.� She had filed a further statement dated 4th
April (B1121).� She expanded upon the incident of 2nd November. She
was very worried about C and was screaming at the father who had refused her
offer of help with lifting the pram. �There was an argument between the parents
at about 0830 on the morning of Sunday 3rd.� The father took C out
until about 16.00 when the mother fed C.� C was upset.� She was crying and the
mother described C�s voice as hoarse.� She only took 60mls of milk and was
given calpol and bonjella. 

77. �Following the father�s return from China on about 28th October, C cried whenever the father tried to pick her up.�
The mother thought that because the father had been away� C thought he was a
stranger.� The grandparents were of the same view. C gradually became used to
the father again.�� Following C�s birth, which was very difficult, the mother
was not well and the father did the majority of C�s care.

78. During her evidence on this occasion the mother was taken
through the various incidents when it is said there was a difficulty with the
pram. �She also gave further details of the occasion when she said that the
father held her by the throat.

79. �While making allowance for the difficulties in assessing
a witness when evidence is given via an interpreter and bearing in mind the
mother�s view as to her first legal team, the mother generally impressed me as
an honest witness.� She clearly loves C and has found these proceedings
bewildering and distressing.� 

80. The father gave evidence.� He has put in two statements,
B1019 dated 13th December and B1139 dated 3rd April.� The
latter is a very lengthy statement. He is not an easy witness to assess.� I
agree with the paternal grandfather that the father is an intelligent man.� He
has a powerful personality and it would not be easy for someone in a close
relationship with him to resist his wishes.� Some of his behaviour appears
bizarre.� 

81. He denied causing the fractures to either the arm or the
ribs or committing acts of domestic abuse.

82. ��He first told me that after he had returned from China at the end of October C became distressed if the father held her.� This was difficult
for the father particularly as in the period after C�s birth he had been the
main carer as the mother was not well. ��

83. On the night of his return he described how he had held C
around her chest.� She became distressed and he handed C to the mother.� C
calmed down but when returned to the father C again became upset. �

84. On the night of 31st October the father described another
incident.� The father himself had an injured arm.� He picked C out of the pram
and held her to his cheat with her head over his left shoulder.�� He rubbed and
patted her back which made her scream and become more distressed. C began to go
purple.�� The father handed C to mother who calmed her after about 10 minutes.�
The father told the court that he now realised that C�s ribs must have been
fractured at some point before 31st October.

85. �JF had produced some photographs of C taken in
early November.�� The father contended that the pictures show a significant
deterioration in C�s condition.� He said that the photographs show that C�s arm
had probably been injured during the incident with the pram.�� ��

86. �When asked questions on behalf of the local authority
the father said that following the incident with the pram on 2nd
November, both parents had checked C.� There was no indication of harm other
than a little speck on her head and on her arm. At this point in his evidence
the father said that he was more worried about the mark on C�s head. �He said
that C had been favouring her left arm since the Sunday and between 3rd
and 9th November had not been moving normally.

87. �He went on to say that he thought that between 2nd
and 9th November, when C arrived at Harrogate Hospital, she had
probably been bathed on three occasions.� 

88. As to his conversation with JF, the father denied
saying that C might have an injured arm.� He maintained that JF had
changed C�s nappy on the Saturday.� He denied that on the Monday he had pointed
out to JF that he was worried about C�s arm.� Her maintained that JF first mentioned it to him saying that he might want to have the arm
looked at.� He denied that JF reacted to the father�s comment about the
arm by saying that if he was worried he as the father should arranged for an
examination.� 

89. It was put to the father that at B1030 paragraph 48 he
had said: �her arm was moving perfectly normal and she was putting both hands
up to her bottle��� The father altered this oral evidence by saying that C used
both hands sufficiently often so that it did not appear that her arm had been
broken.� Nevertheless the father said that C used one arm on what he said were
multiple occasions but her preference was to use her right arm.� 

90. The father denied that he is a fantasist.��� He agreed
that he told the mother that he had a PHD which had been funded for him by the
CIA.� He did this in order to check up on the mother who he believed worked for
the Chinese intelligent agencies.� He said that his computers were under
constant attack.� He admitted that he had told the mother a number of lies
about himself.� He had met the mother via the internet in April/May 2011.� By
the beginning of June he estimated that 40 machines were trying to breach his
network.� He described himself as mortified that he did not explain this to the
mother before they married and indeed had not done so before this emerged during
this hearing.� He told the court that if the choice was between a loving
relationship and the security of the UK, he would choose the latter.

91. �The father denied that he threaten to call UKBA so that
the mother would be removed from the UK. I do not believe him.� I prefer the
evidence of the grandfather on this point. He said that he hoped that by the
purchase of a property in the UK he would be able to avoid the need for the
mother to return to China in order to renew her visa but if UKBA learned of
this, the mother would be removed.

92. The father gave a further explanation and demonstration
both during this part of his cross examination and when at his request he was
later recalled of the incident with the pram on Saturday 2nd
November.� He said that the weight of shopping which had been hung on the handle
and placed on the shelf beneath increased the overall weight.� This together
with the loss of a wheel contributed to the fall of the pram and forced him to
let go of the pram.�� C was asleep and she was propelled from a prone position
to one where her head was above the rear rim of the pram. He agreed when asked
about this on behalf of the guardian that C did not move very much. �Her right
arm was said to be sticking out of the side and therefore vulnerable to a
guillotine motion of the bar and hood.� He could not say if C�s arm was
trapped.� When he lifted C out of the pram nothing restrained her arm.

93. With reference to the photograph at I 8150/1 the father
denied causing the marks on the mother�s throat.� He denied putting his hands
around the mother�s throat.� He asserted that the mother was self harming and
in her struggle to release from what the father described as his light
restraining grip the mother�s throat was injured by one of the father�s
watches. �The father always wears a watch on each wrist.���� He said that the
mother had bitten his hand in May 2013.� He first said that was because the
mother was suffering from Post Natal depression.� He then realised that mother
was pregnant at the time.� He then asserted the incident must have been caused
by the mother�s depression during her pregnancy.� The mother�s account which I
prefer is that the father�s hand was over the mother�s mouth and she bit his
hand to remove it.���� �He agreed that he did slap the mother during the
incident in the shower in Wales but only to revive her.�� He denied that he had
been violent to Claire Bartrum (I 8052). He asserted that when JF had
told the police (I 8100) of his poor behaviour the father said that the
allegations were untrue.� She was his ex partner who was motivated by
jealousy.� JF had wanted to marry the father and saw the mother as a theat.� 

94. He was asked about the text message at I 8149.� He said
that it was in response to a similar one from the mother and he did not mean it
when he threatened to take C away so that the mother would never see C again.�
He denied saying to his own father (I 8078) on 7th November to tell
the mother that he was going to take C abroad and the family would not see her
again.

95. I was not impressed by the father.� He did not strike me
as a reliable witness.� He seemed excessively concerned about persuading the
court that his view of events must be the correct one.�� 

96. ��The paternal grandparents both gave evidence.� Their
various statements are at I 8069, I 8080, I 8103,I 8273 (a chronology) and,
B1073.

97. They were both very hurt by the serious allegations made
against them by the father.� They denied them. Having heard their evidence I
prefer their accounts to those of the father where they differ.� I am satisfied
that neither of the grandparents treated the father as alleged by him. 

98. �The grandfather described how he had had concerns about
the father�s mental health in the past. This had particularly been the case
after the father�s wife had left him. He had lost his job and had suffered a
motor cycle accident.� The grandfather described him as highly intelligent and
with help he could be successful. He still fantasises.� 

99. He was clear that the father had threatened the mother to
have her removed from the UK.� Somebody had told UKBA as 3 Officers had arrived
at the house at 0730 one morning. 

100.         
He described the
father as being a caring parent especially in the early weeks after C�s birth
when the mother was unwell. �The father found it difficult to deal with the
situation after his return from China at the end of October when C cried if the
father tried to hold her.� 

�Submissions.

 

101.         
Written
submissions were put in on behalf of each of the parties.� In addition to his
counsel�s submissions Mr. Apps put in further documents.

102.         
�Miss O�Hara,
Counsel for the mother, came into the case half way through the hearing.

103.         
She submitted that
the medical evidence establishes that C�s injuries were non-accidental.� The
only significant episode that the mother can recall was the event when the pram
tipped on the steps at the home of the paternal grandparents� home.� This, it
is said, neither fits with the likely time window nor is followed by behaviour
in C suggestive of a fractured arm.

104.         
In paragraph of
her written submissions Miss O�Hara considers the chronology of C�s care.�
Because of the mother�s illness after C�s birth the father took over the care
of C.� In the second part of October the father absented himself from the home
and the mother took over care and was seen by the grandparents to be gentle and
patient with C.� 

105.         
�It is agreed that
following the father�s return at the end of October C�s reaction to the father
was adverse.� A number of observers noted that the father appeared to take it
personally when C cried.� The grandparents were worried that the father was too
firm in the manner in which he handled C.

106.         
�It is submitted
that the father�s conduct last autumn had more to do with asserting his own
position than with the welfare of C.� I agree with that.

107.         
It is further
submitted on behalf of the mother that she has been subjected to a pattern of
lies, manipulation and violence at the hands of the father. I agree. Indeed the
father admitted in evidence that much of what he had told the mother about
himself was untrue.� Of the two parents it is submitted that the mother is the
more reliable historian.� I think that is correct. 

108.         
Miss O�Hara
strongly submits that the mother can properly be exonerated from any
involvement in C�s injuries or failure to protect from harm.� I agree.

109.         
Mr. Blount also
came into the case half way through this hearing.� I am grateful for his help.�


110.         
As I have already
indicated the evidence and demeanour of the father gave cause for concern. I
remind myself that it is necessary rigorously to evaluate all the evidence.� In
this case also the father has admitted to telling lies to the mother about
himself.� I do not think that he was truthful about the episodes of violence
that he perpetrated upon the mother.� The court must be careful to bear in mind
that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty,
panic, fear and distress.� It does not mean that the father has liked about
everything else and in particular about the circumstances of C�s injuries. 

111.         
In his written
submissions on behalf of the father, Mr. Blount emphasised that the father did
not assault the mother, did not cause any of C�s injuries and had a close and
loving relationship with C.

112.         
The father has
also handed in a number of further documents and his own additional written
submissions which his Counsel has referred to but not further analysed.� I have
attempted to deal with the major matters which the father has raised and which
are not otherwise covered.� 

113.         
As to the
allegations of domestic violence and abuse it is submitted that the incident in
  Wales culminated in the mother collapsing into the father�s arms and that he
merely patted the mother�s cheeks in order to revive her.� It is said that the
mother subsequently agreed with this account. I do not think she did or if so
it is unlikely to have been an agreement with full understanding of what was
being suggested. �As to the throat incident the father�s case is that he simply
�cupped� the mother�s face as they both lay on the bed.� The mother agrees that
they were on the bed together.� She had her back to the father.� He tried to
turn the mother towards him and to hug her.� The mother resisted and screamed.�
She agreed that the father was trying to stop her crying and held her face.�
The father always wears two metal watches, one on each wrist.�� 

114.         
The father says
that the mother bit him on more than one occasion. I do not agree. I have seen
a photograph of his injured hand which the father says was the result of such a
bite.� The mother accepted that she bit him once in order to get him to remove
his hand from across her mouth.

115.         
The father agrees
that the mother is a vulnerable person.� I think it may be that when distressed
and frustrated by the father�s behaviour and her circumstances she cried and
screamed.

116.         
As to the injuries
it is submitted that these were caused accidentally during incidents with the
pram/car seat.� The rib fractures occurred it is said were caused in one or
other of the 4 incidents set out in paragraphs 131-158 of the father�s recent
statement.� The arm fractures it is said happened during the incident on 2nd
November.� 

117.         
It is submitted
that there is no evidence of C being in the sort of distressed state that one
would expect immediately following such injuries.�� In his own document the
father asserts that C screamed on a number of occasions in October when in her
car seat and after the incident on 2nd November.� The father was
absent from the home for a significant period in October and C was distressed
when held by him around the ribs after his return. 

118.         
�It is said that
the photographs taken by JF on 3rd November suggest that
there was an injury to C�s arm.� One of the photographs shows C in her pram
with her left hand resting on the bottle.� The weight of the bottle was on the
pram cover.� The second photograph shows C again in her pram but without a
bottle.� Part of her left hand is visible. The right arm is not.�� It is right
that the mother said in evidence that in the picture C does not appear well.�
The mother had earlier said that on 3rd November C�s voice was hoarse
and she had a runny nose.� She was given calpol.� When Miss JF saw C on 3rd
and during the following days she did not notice anything untoward. It does not
seem that if at the time the father was worried about the right arm he took any
action about it.� By 9th November the arm is reported to be puffy, C
distressed and there is limited movement.��� �

119.         
In his own
document the father says that Dr. Halliday�s evidence as to the timing of the
arm fractures cannot be relied upon.� On the basis of Periosteal Reaction alone
he says with reference to a paper by Drs Gallagher and Halliday, another by Dr.
Chapman and Dr. Halliday�s evidence in this case, that the radiological window
is variously: 31st October to 7th November (joint paper),
29th October to 7th November (evidence in the case) and
28th October to 7th November (Chapman paper).

120.         
The father is
particularly critical of Dr. Halliday�s approach to the question of soft tissue
swelling.� He says that this is highly unreliable.� He says that when C was at Harrogate hospital her arm was likely to have been manipulated and this is likely to have
caused soft tissue injury. If so this would affect the timing of the injury and
supports his contention that soft tissue damage occurred at hospital on 9/10th
November.� The father submitted that C was showing no sign of distress before
she was admitted to the hospital at Harrogate. 

�

121.         
In her oral
evidence the Doctor referred to the x-rays which were taken on 9th
and 11th November. As at 9th November she said that the
fractures were less than 11days old (31st October) but that the
presence of soft tissue swelling on that image reduced the window to 5 days
from 9th November.� The doctor�s examination of the x-ray of 11th
November in her opinion reduced the window to 4th - 7th
November

122.         
When
cross-examined by the father�s former counsel Dr. Halliday accepted that soft
tissue swelling, which she said was quite marked in this case (M11010), is a
guide and a �softer� sign. ��She remained of the view that the injury was
likely to have been caused within 5 days of 11th November (M 11025).

123.         
The father pointed
out that in his short report at J9015 dated 9th November Dr.
Sapherson, who was not called to give oral evidence, said: �there is no
evidence of either soft tissue swelling or peri-osteal reaction making it
difficult to accurately to date but I suggest less than one week�.� This
suggests that the earliest date for Dr. Sapherson�s window is 3rd
November. �Dr. Halliday suggested 5 days from 9th i. e. from 4th
November. ��In respect of the images of 9th November Dr. Sapherson,
appears to have arrived at a similar conclusion to Dr. �Halliday.� 

124.         
In his report
dated 11th November at J9016 Dr. Sapherson has nothing further to say about the
arm fractures.� He gives no window for the rib fractures. 

125.         
The father
contended that because Professor Wyatt relied to a large extent upon Dr.
Halliday�s report he was mislead as to the dating of the arm fractures.� �I do
not agree that Dr. Halliday�s evidence on this point is flawed and see also
Professor Wyatt at M11049.� 

126.         
As to mechanism
Professor Wyatt agreed that an arm might be fractured by a guillotine motion if
it were directly trapped between two very rigid forceful objects (M11036).�
Both experts saw the father�s first demonstration.� They did not see his later
demonstration with a doll.� Given the forces at work and the nature of the
pram�s construction neither thought that this was the cause of the arm fractures
in this case. �

127.         
Both Dr. Halliday
and Professor Wyatt saw and considered the additional material and questions
put to them by the father.� Neither altered her/his opinion.

128.         
�As to the rib
fractures Professor Wyatt considered this at M11039.� He agreed with Dr.
Halliday that the incidents in the car were very unlikely to have caused these.
�

129.         
Starting at
paragraph 151 of his document the father attacks the evidence and motives of
JF and his parents.� Having seen and heard those witnesses I reject the
father�s allegations.� 

130.         
Starting at
paragraph 183 the father has summarised his main points.� He goes on to invite
the court to make 34 findings.� The most important are those contained in
paragraphs 1, (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and then 1, 5 12,13,16, 24 and 30.� I
have also read a letter from him dated 22nd April.� ����������������

131.         
On behalf of the
local authority Mr. Hand submitted that this hearing is not only concerned
about C�s physical injuries but also about the circumstances of the parents�
relationship.� ��

132.         
Paragraphs 2-5 of
the Revised Schedule of Proposed Findings contain allegations and Findings
sought in relation to the relationship.� The local authority contends that the
threshold under section 31(2) CA is established on those matters alone.� Paragraphs
6-8 deal with C�s injuries. It is said that the threshold is crossed on this basis
also.

133.         
In paragraphs 2 -
7 of his submissions Mr. Hand conducted a survey of the matters which he says
support the local authority�s case that the parents� relationship was a
turbulent one.� At paragraph 28 he summarises the position and invited the court
to find that as at November 2013 that in respect of C�s stability and security
she was likely to suffer significant harm.

134.         
Starting at
paragraph 9 Mr. Hand considered C�s injuries.� He referred to the evidence of
Professor Wyatt. In his report of February 2014 the Professor made the
following points:

�        
The description of
C given by the father whilst alone with him is not consistent with the clinical
description of her appearance at hospital

�        
The fading bruise
on C�s right wrist and the abrasion on the right forearm are consistent with
excessive forceful handling of the right arm but are not conclusive evidence of
that.

�        
The car seat
incident on 2nd November is a possible but unlikely cause of the
fractures to the right forearm.� It is pointed out that C�s behaviour during
the 24 hours after the incident was not observed to be unusual.� The incident
occurred 2 days outside Dr. Halliday�s likely radiological window.

�        
The clinical
description of C and of the arm on 9th November is consistent with a
fracture having occurred up to 3 days earlier rather than a week earlier.

�        
As to the ribs the
Professor was concerned that no accidental explanation had been given but the
court must be careful about this point as there is a danger of reversing the
burden of proof

�        
The mother was
worried that the father held C too tightly

�        
At paragraph of
his report Professor Wyatt said that rib fractures are likely to have been
caused by excessive mechanical forces exerted on the chest by adult hands.

 

135.         
In his oral
evidence Professor Wyatt said that there would have been what he described as a
very unusual freak accident for the car seat to have been responsible for the
rib fractures. 

136.         
As to the arm
injury the Professor was of the view that the clinical presentation on 9th
November pointed to the injury having occurred within a very small number of
days before 9th November.� He thought that the infliction of the
injury on 2nd was possible but very unlikely. �

137.         
Following the oral
evidence of both the medical witnesses the father submitted further written
questions to each.� In relation to the marks on the arm noted on 9th
November the Professor thought it unlikely that they had been caused on 2nd
and that the marks seemed to be consistent with someone having gripped the arm.


138.         
Mr. Hand referred
to Dr. Halliday�s report where she deals with the mechanism which she says is
likely to have caused the injuries to C.� For the rib fractures a squeezing of
the chest is required, that is to say an application of force to the front and
back. This was confirmed in the oral evidence (M11013) and in reply to the
further written questions. The fractures to the arm require either a direct
blow or more likely a sharp angulation at that point. It is pointed out that in
her oral evidence the doctor did not agree that the rib fractures could have
been caused by the car seat in any of the events suggested by the father.� 

139.         
As to the arm
fractures the Doctor thought that the incident with the car seat was a possible
but unlikely cause.� The father made a number of complaints about the car seat
but continued to use it. 

140.         
�Mr. Hand
conducted an analysis of the incident of 2nd November and submits
that the likely radiological window and the relevant evidence does not support
the contention that the arm fractures were caused in this incident. I agree. Indeed
in his statement at B1030 paragraph 48 the father reported that up until the
removal of C from his care on 9th November �her arm was moving
perfectly normal and she was putting both hands up to her bottle�.

141.         
Mr. Hand submitted
that in this case the court can properly conclude as follows:

 

�        
C suffered
non-accidental injuries as earlier described;

�        
That the father
was the sole perpetrator of the� injuries;

�        
The father would
have known at the time that he had injured C and should have sought medical
attention.� He failed to do so;

�        
The parents�
relationship was turbulent and chaotic and marked by incidents of domestic
abuse;

�        
Having removed C
on 3rd November the father�s subsequent care of her was chaotic
until his arrest on 9th November;

�        
�As a result C had
suffered and was likely to suffer significant physical and emotional harm at the
time proceedings were begun in November 2014.

 

142.         
From paragraph 6
in her written submissions on behalf of the guardian, Miss Whitby reviewed the
evidence and the articles which the father he wished the Dr. Halliday to
consider.

143.         
Dr. Halliday
considered these.� Those relating to pain were outside her expertise.� The
Wikipedia entries were not peer reviewed.

144.         
As to the arm
fractures it is pointed out in paragraph 8 that in the doctor�s opinion the
soft tissue swelling is more likely due to the fractures than to any other
event.� 

145.         
Professor Wyatt at
M11053 described the nature of the pain following a fracture.� His view was
that this level of pain was reflected in C�s presentation at hospital on 9th
November and not as a result of separation from normal care givers (M11054).�
If that is so the evidence of the father to the effect that C was not
distressed in the car when he was stopped by the police is not accurate.� The
police did not observe C to be upset.

146.         
������It is
pointed out that the father�s parents said that after the incident of 2nd
November said that C settled quickly.� Neither recalled any mention by the
father that the mother had agreed that the father had only tapped the mother on
the face in order to calm her after the incident in Wales. ��Neither had seen
the mother harm her own neck. They agreed that the mother hit her own face when
distressed.

147.         
�It is submitted
in paragraph 23 that the explanations given by the father as to mechanism for
the two sets of fractures are not plausible.� I agree.� I also accept the
mother�s account as to the causation by the father of the red marks on the
mother�s neck and of the incident in Wales.

148.         
Miss Whitby
submits that the father is not a reliable witness.� She points, for example, to
the father�s change of account when he belatedly asserted that JF had
twice bathed C at her home and once at The Days Inn Hotel.� This is not
mentioned in his statements.� I agree that, if true, it is a vital piece of the
evidential jigsaw particularly as at an early stage in the case there was
consideration as to whether JF might be in the pool of possible
perpetrators.

149.         
Miss Whitby also
submitted that stories which the father told the mother about himself do not
help his case.

150.         
It is submitted on
behalf of the guardian that the court can safely make the findings requested by
the local authority. 

����� ����

Conclusion.

 

151.         
The fractures to
the right forearm were non-accidental.� They were inflicted by the father
between the 4th and 7th November 2013 during a period
when C was either mainly or wholly in his care; 

152.         
The mother had
nothing to do with these injuries;

153.         
The father would
have known that he had injured C. He should have sought medical attention and
failed to do so;

154.         
The rib
fractures:� I accept the medical evidence that fractures of this nature are
indicative but not determinative of non-accidental injury.� The manner in which
the father was seen to handle C caused concern. I reject the explanation that
these were caused by the car seat. On the other hand the radiological window is
wide (2-6 weeks between 30th September and 28th October).� For some
of that period the father was not at home.� The evidence about this is unclear.��
��There is the danger of acceptable inference turning to speculation and that
given the view that the court and others have formed of the father, concluding the
father inflicted this injury and it was non-accidental. ��I am of the opinion
that the court cannot find that these injuries were non-accidental.� I do not
know what happened.

155.         
The parents
relationship was a turbulent and chaotic;

156.         
I am satisfied
that the father assaulted the mother in Wales by slapping her face as she
says.�� I also find that in the course of a protracted incident of domestic
violence on 3rd November 2013 the father inflicted the injuries to
the mother�s throat. 

157.         
The father wrongly
removed C from the mother�s care on 3rd November. He sent the mother
text message threatening that she would not see C again. �Thereafter he
provided chaotic and unsatisfactory care for C until his arrest on 9th
November. �

158.         
Consequently by
reason of these findings C had suffered and was likely to suffer significant
physical and motional harm as at the date when protective measures were started
in November 2013.

159.         
The mother did not
cause any injury to C.� In so far as she was involved in incidents of domestic
violence I find that she was the innocent party and that the father was the
instigator of such events.� In so far as her reaction might be said to be
extreme I find that this was because of her isolation, distress and frustration
caused by the father�s treatment of her.

 I have conducted a Fact Finding and Threshold Criteria Split hearing. The welfare hearing was originally listed also during this week but the Local Authority (LA) sought to adjourn that due to not having finalised its care plans, they having decided (pre fact finding) that the children could not be returned to the parents' care but not having finalised their alternative plans. I agreed and retained the listing for fact finding and Threshold Criteria hearing. The welfare hearing has been listed for 16th June time estimate 5 days.

 

I am asked by the LA to find as facts matters 2-12 on the composite schedule at A51-56, namely allegations of physical abuse by the mother and/or father against the 2 children L and J and an additional matter pleaded in the draft Threshold ie "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals". The parents submit that upon analysis of the evidence none of the findings should be made. The Children's Guardian has played a full part in the hearing and through counsel has drawn the court's attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence. 

 

I have been greatly assisted by all 4 Counsel during the hearing and by their detailed submissions. 

 

THE LAW

 

The LA has the burden of proving the facts it seeks and of proving that the Threshold Criteria are met. These issues fall to be resolved on the balance of probabilities. The law is clear and the Court follows the guidance given by the House of Lords in Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35: 
"The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened." (Lord Hoffman, para.2) 

Baroness Hale said (para.32):
"In our legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof".

If the LA cannot establish the facts to the required standard, they are to be treated as not having taken place. The LA therefore bears the burden of establishing that the parents acted towards the children in the ways that are detailed in the said Scott Schedule. There is no burden on the parents to establish that they did not so act. They are also not required to provide any satisfactory or benign explanation as to why L and J have made statements about their conduct towards them (Re M (Fact Finding Hearing: Burden of Proof) [2013] 2 FLR 874)

BACKGROUND

This is the second set of proceedings involving the parents MB and KR (the parents). The first concerned P, K, L and J and ended after 13 months of proceedings on 12.9.13 when DJ (MC) Arbuthnot made a Supervision Order to the LA. The 2 elder children P and K were to live with their father Mr H.  J and L had been returned to their parents' home on 11.8.13 along with baby KR who was born during those proceedings on 27.5.13 and had remained living with the parents. The Threshold was agreed by the parties to those proceedings on 12.9.13. 

 

On 19.9.13 all 3 children (L, J and baby KR) were removed from the parents' care following an allegation made by J that day at school. The 3 children have been placed separately since 19.9.13 except that since 21.2.14 L moved to join J with maternal aunt MR. 

 

WITNESSES

The hearing lasted for 5 days and evidence was heard  from the following witnesses:             

 

      a) Dr. H Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist
      b) CB and GE, the Allocated Social Workers
 c) MR, Maternal Aunt presently caring for L and J
      d) Ms. CT, Independent Social Worker
      e) The Nursery/School staff Ms S, Ms W, Ms C 
      f)  L's foster carer, HM
	 g) Both Police Officers who attended at the school, DC K and DC B who conducted the ABE interview of  L
      h) The Parents MB and KR

CHRONOLOGY

I set out below a detailed history of the relevant events with my observations as to the strength of the evidence and/or my analysis. (references to "children" should be taken to mean L and J unless indicated otherwise). I do not propose to set out each witness's evidence; I will refer to relevant evidence in the chronology and analysis. I have of course read the entire trial bundle and additional documents prepared and watched L's Achieving Best Evidence interview (ABE) 4 times. 

 

Until 28.8.12 L and J had always been in the care of their mother; they were then 3.9y and 2.2y respectively. On that date she assaulted P in their presence, while drunk. Following her arrest the mother agreed to the children being accommodated. L and P were placed together with the mother's sister MP, J with her sister MR. The LA unsurprisingly commenced care proceedings. 

 

Dr H said that such an event would be well remembered by the children. MR told the court that P discussed the incident with her siblings.

This assault was likely to have been a significant memory for L and J, not least because it marked the beginning of their separation from their parents' care until August 2013.

The parents are a couple; the father formally lives in his mother's home in Battersea and the mother in the LA. The father stays with the mother the majority of time. 

On 24.12.12 P assaulted her maternal aunt MP, witnessed by L. Dr H again agreed this was likely to have been a significant memory for L.

 

On 27.5.13 baby KR was born and remained in the care of his mother. 

 

On 10.6.13 J approached Ms A a Speech and Language Therapist (SALT) visiting his nursery; she was not his treating SALT. He told her "mummy pushed and hurt me here" and pointed to his right eyebrow; he said and did this twice. She could not see a mark on J. One of the 2 allocated Social Workers, GE, accepted in evidence that this incident could not have happened as described; the mother was not having unsupervised contact with J in this period. The LA does not seek to prove this but it is a relevant complaint as part of the chronology. It is the first time that either child made any complaint against either parent. 

 

On 10.7.13 GE spoke to J, he said in evidence that he decided not to ask J directly about what he had said on 10.6.13 because he doubted his ability to recall from a month earlier. J told GE that he was happy at home.

 

On 22/23.7.13 it was noted that J had an injury to his upper lip/nose area. He gave a variety of explanations; to MR he attributed it to L, to his mother he blamed MRs' children and also said that all 3 of his cousins has caused it. He said "they beat me up and I beat them all up".

 

On 2.7.13 the rehabilitation plan began to the parents. The first unsupervised visit for L and J with their mother was 2.7.13. Before the children moved home full time on 11.8.13 some work was done with them about the move home which focused on practicalities. I accept MRs' evidence that she was not given any guidance about how to assist J emotionally during this period. The other allocated Social Worker CB was unable to give any evidence as to what, if any, advice the LA gave to either child's carer. I deal with this below at paragraph 73.

 

On 11.8.13 L and J moved back to the mother's care full time. 

 

 Between 11.8.13-19.9.13 the family was visited regularly by Social Workers, Family Support Worker, Health Visitor, J was taken to SALT (the mother missed his first appointment but kept subsequent ones), baby KR was taken to appointments including medical and L and J attended school/nursery from the beginning of term, J starting a few days into the term due to a staggered intake.

 

There was nothing complained of by the children during these 5 weeks. There was no evidence of physical harm noted. 

On 12.9.13 a 12 months Supervision Order was made by DJ (MC) Arbuthnot.  P and K by agreement were to live with their father Mr H, with contact to their mother. The LA arrived at court with a document headed "Schedule of Requirements" which they wished the parents to sign.  This may have been sent via the legal department the day before, but the parents had not seen the list of requirements until the hearing day. There was discussion about this all day at court. 

 

The parents were willing to sign an amended document called a "Working Agreement" which differed in a few ways. I set these out later at paragraphs 82-83.

 

Despite the fact that the LA original document was not signed at court the District Judge was presented with an agreed position that the children remain in the care of their parents, the father agreed to a Supervision  Order, mother's counsel made brief submissions that one was not required and the District Judge made a Supervision Order. All parties on 12.9.13 must have been of the view that the 3 children's welfare was best met in the care of their mother and father. 

 

On 19.9.13 J made comments to his nursery teacher Ms C. Her note reads:

 

"I was telling T�. who had hurt someone that I didn't like hitting. J was standing nearby. J said "I don't like punching" I said "I wonder who punches you" J said "my daddy do punch me" He continued playing then said "my mummy make me cry". I said I wonder why she makes you cry" J answered "hurt me and smack me and punch me"

I note that the teacher asked "I wonder who punches you" which invites J to suggest someone's name and introduces the idea of "you" ie J being pushed. J himself had not suggested to his teacher that he was the victim of being punched until she suggested it to him. This is an early example of J diverting adult attention to himself. 

The school contacted Social Services who called the police. I fully understand why the school took that action, but it appears to me that the Social Workers should have taken time to consider what J said to his teacher in the light of his obvious untruth to the SALT on 10.6.13. The Social Work team did not seek to ask question the illogicality of J saying on 10.6.13 that his mother with whom he had had only supervised contact for 10 months could have injured him on the eyebrow, where in fact there was no visible injury. It was only at the end of day 5 of the hearing, when all of the evidence had been heard and in answer to my question about the schedule that Counsel for the LA confirmed that they did not seek to prove the allegation on 10.6.13. Further the Social Work team knew that J had given varying accounts of the injury to his upper lip on 22/23 July 2013. They were aware by 19.9.13 that J was known to have made false statements.

 

At the end of the school day on 19.9.13 J and L remained in the room shared by the Nursery and Reception class, which had a pull across divider/partition. They spent a number of hours playing in this room according to the Headteacher Ms S. 

 

In my judgment J had the opportunity during these hours to repeat to L what he had said to Ms C. 

At 16.50h CB  and Ms W the Asst Headteacher spoke to J. CB produced in evidence a note written by her the next day at 8.26am. CB could identify only 3 of the words J said, "L" "Mummy" and "Punch". CB was not certain which way round the words were said. Ms W believed that J said "L punch Mummy" and according to DC B Ms W was sure at the time on 19.9.13 that the words were said that way round. 

It is common ground that J had unclear speech that was quite difficult at times to understand.

Where was L during the conversation with J?  The Nursery and Reception classes had one large room with floor to ceiling pull across partition/divider. J was in the Nursery side of the room. L was playing on the computer on the Reception side of the room, near to the divider. CB was unclear whether the divider was closed, Ms W said L was on other side of the divider.  Ms C said it is likely that she left the partition open. Ms S was in and out of the room a few times and clearly remembered L in the same room as J, she indicated a distance about 4-5 metres apart. I cannot come to any firm conclusion as to whether the divider was open or closed given these varying accounts � but I can be sure that L was playing on a computer in the Reception end of the room, a few metres away from the conversation with J and there were no other children around apart from J. Even if the divider was fully or partly drawn, L was sitting at a computer near to the divider in a quiet room. L could well have heard the discussion between her brother and CB and DC B. She would have known that to stay behind at school in this way with adults talking to J was unusual. 

 

Later DC B and CB spoke with L. There is no contemporaneous note of this "interview" � which is the word used to describe it by CB in her file note. This is poor practice by them both as professionals having discussions/interviews with a 4 year old. CB's file note says that she did not take a note as DC K was doing so. DC K has confirmed that she was not taking a note and was sitting some 8 metres away. 

 

CB notes that the police asked L  directly if anyone hurt her at home, she initially said J but then went on to say clearly that mummy had punched her and when asked where she advised it was in the stomach and demonstrated this by punching her own stomach with a closed fist, she made reference to smacking. When asked if she wanted to go home L said no but CB did not know if this was because she was having a great deal of fun on the computer.

 

DC B told the court that J was playing on the other side of the room about 5 metres away while she was speaking with L.

 

CB did not note or recall any complaint by L against her father. DC B has no recollection of such a complaint. DC K completed a CRIS report at 19.56h referring to a conversation between DC B, CB and L "L also disclosed to DC B that dad slaps her but it is unknown were [sic]"

 

DC B agreed in evidence that when she was summarising the conversation to DC K she would also have been discussing the earlier allegations made by J when deciding whether to exercise police powers of protection. 

 

The only reference to L making an allegation against her father is a note made by DC K who did not hear the relevant conversation. Those who did speak with L were involved in safeguarding and it is highly unlikely that the Social Worker would have failed to note or recall such a complaint by L about her father. 

 

I find that it is unlikely that L made any allegation against her father in this discussion with CB and DC B.

 

The lack of any contemporaneous note, the fact that somehow DC K has introduced the idea of a complaint against the father in her CRIS report which even CB does not note, the blunt question by DC B asking if anyone hits her at home, and the evidence that L is happily engaged at the computer, all leads me to have real concerns about what L is alleging, if anything.

 

The children would have known something significant was happening when they said goodbye to their parents and went off to stay elsewhere. I agree with the submission by Counsel for the father that the children are likely to have realised that complaints of physical abuse attract adult attention.

 

The police took the 2 children, plus baby KR who had come to school with the mother, into police protection. The parents were allowed to say goodbye. The police and school staff all described the parents as cooperative and appropriate at school that evening, particularly given the circumstances. 

 

All 3 children were separated in placements. The parents have had only supervised contact since then, 6 months ago.

 

Later that evening L stated that she did not want to be cared for by her aunt MPand that her aunt had hit her. L subsequently informed her aunt MR that aunt MP had not hit her. The LA view is that there is no truth in what L alleges against MP. L went to an emergency foster placement that night and to a different foster carer MH the next day, where she remained until 21.2.14 when she moved to her aunt MRs' home following L's allegations of harm by MH.

 

J was placed with MR on 19.9.13. On that day J told her 10 year old son that his "mummy burned me daddy punched L in the belly and my mummy and daddy slapped K in the mouth".  It is a fact that no burn was noted at the Child Protection medical or otherwise. It appears therefore that J was saying something clearly untrue.

 

On 20.9.13 DC B carried out an ABE interview of  L. I have watched this several times. I have no hesitation in concluding that this was a difficult interview to conduct due to L being very unsettled, but equally that this is a flawed interview. The LA relies upon this interview and asserts that L's statements are reliable.

 

There are deficiencies in the interview process, which are highlighted by ISW, Ms CT on both her reports. DC B largely accepted these in her evidence. Dr H agreed there were deficiencies.

The deficiencies include the following:
a.	adult language was used by the officer e.g. audio, cassette tapes � with no explanation to ensure that she understood;
b.	early in the interview DC B referred L back to their conversation of the previous evening rather than allowing the interview to progress more freely. The officer did not accept this criticism in cross examination and said that L was already aware of why she was being interviewed. In circumstances where the DC had not made a note of the discussion the evening before this is an even more concerning technique. 
c.	L was not asked what made her happy before what made her sad. There was no attempt to introduce any balance. 
d.	L substitutes 'P' for 'Mummy; this is not properly clarified and nor is the context; The mention of P hurting her was not explored at all, just ignored, in contrast to remarks about her mother which were followed up, indicating that the officer was more interested in mummy than other names.
e.	The misleading impression is given to L that some things are believed and others are not without the statements being given the same inference and weight;
f.	L was distracted, active and difficult to interview.
g.	Constant leading questions were used and there was reinforcement of negative responses in relation to Mummy;
h.	No clarification of context, time place, who present or the use of the certain crucial words e.g. 'hit' 'flip' and 'flick'. No exploration of what hit flick etc meant.
i.	Clear lack of open-ended questions;
j.	Clear examples of the child being rewarded for answers perceived as 'positive' by the interviewer with specific inducements including playing with toys when she is clearly bored of being interviewed;
k.	Significant inconsistencies that were not explored � e.g. 'Mummy is a he'; the comment that 'M' the 'baby' had punched her. It turned out that M had in fact merely made baby KR cry, and had not punched at all. This would have been an excellent opportunity for the officer to try to find out what L meant by punch.
l.	Significant levels of miscommunications, which were not clarified;
m.	There was no social worker present 
n.	It is significant that L emphatically stated that she liked living at home with no indication of fear

On 20.9.13 Child Protection medicals were carried out on both children by a doctor who had been given detail of what had been alleged. No unexplained injuries were noted, the children's presentation was entirely normal, baby KR was said to be thriving. L is noted to be well looked after and thriving, presenting as sociable cheerful and chatty. J was also in good health, well presented and chatty. 

 

On 25.9.13 CB's statement gives an account that GE visited the children at school and that L appeared relaxed after she was told by GE in answer to her question "you watch me" that she would be watched . GEs' file note placed a different slant on this, it quite clearly sets out how the children say they want to see their mother and L misses her, and that her mummy makes her happy, and L said "you watch me" and GE said a nice lady would [watch her] . There is no reference at all in GEs' note to L's face and body language appearing relaxed after hearing she would be watched. L spoke very positively about her mother, not at all apprehensive about seeing her, despite what CB says (who was not present). J told GE that all his friends hit him and make him sad, but then went happily to sit down and play with another boy. CB's statement does not accurately reflect GEs' own file note and gives a misleading impression that L is seeking reassurance that there will be supervision. I also note that L  is a child who knows that she has been "watched" for a year in contact, so someone watching would not be unusual for her.

 

L's foster carer MH says that on 1.10.13 L, whilst saying she wants to see her mum said "sometime my mum beat me and then my kidney hurt". The foster carer reported this to the LA the next day. A note has not been produced by her despite the fact she said she kept a diary. It is not suggested that L knew what a kidney is or where it is.

 

On 4.10.13 at contact J made a statement that his teacher cut his nose with a knife. His teacher denies this and the allegation appears untrue, but it is noteworthy that he said it. 

 

On 7.10.13 J made statements to MR. He denied being burnt or hurt by his mother, and said "mummy never hit the baby". When asked if she did burn him he did not respond. When asked a leading question if she had burned or hurt him he said yes. (this is a very interesting piece of evidence and it seems to me that if asked questions in a certain way J confirms, even though he had retracted what he said. There is no evidence that J was ever burnt by anyone)

 

On 11.10.13 J said that his escort had hit him and swung him around. This seems unlikely. J said this to MR after she asked why he had been hitting the escort himself, again it appears the allegation may have been made to deflect attention from him own actions. 

 

On 16.10.13 MR said that J was crying saying K, her son, hit him. MR told the court she was sure that this could not have been true as K was downstairs and she would have seen him go past her. This shows J is capable of telling untruths, and with emotional distress accompanying.

 

Also that same day a one year old child R accidentally caught J in the face causing a small scratch above the nose. J told MR that R had punched him in the face. This raises a question for me as to whether J knows what "punch" means? And/or whether he deliberately told another untruth.

 

On 16th and 11th October J volunteered to MR that his mother did not hurt or burn him. 

 

On 6.11.13 Ms C says that J made a statement that day in circle time. The class were taking turns to say "I don't like�" Some other children said "I don't like hitting/punching", J said "My mum just hit me on the leg", and went on to say his mum flicked him, hit him in the belly, and punched L in belly and mum smacked him in the belly and face. No contemporaneous note was produced by Ms C. She rang GE 2 weeks later on 20.11.13; he does not recall her referring to a note. If one existed I am surprised that she did not send it to GE. A school safeguarding form completed by Ms S on 21.11.13 differs from the email sent to GE on 20.11.13 as to the latter part. It seems likely that on 20.11.13 Ms C was trying to recall what was said by J on 6.11.13. When reading her 20.11.13 note it appears that J having got the class' attention adds something extra with each successive sentence. 

 

Later that day in contact the contact records that J alleges his mother hurt him when she carefully pushed his chair under the table. The note puts the word carefully in bold. This is another example of J making an allegation which is demonstrably untrue.

 

On 21.11.13 again in front of whole class J said "I am sad when mum hits me in the face and dad punches L in the belly. But not C he don't do nothing". GE visited J that day. J said he felt happy when baby KR cuddles him and "then my dad punches me in the belly". It is odd that J describes himself as happy then discloses physical abuse. J expressed his clear wish to see his parents and go home. 

 

On 26.11.13 J was taken to see the Asst Head Ms W due to bad behaviour. He said he wanted to talk about that incident later and instead he wanted to talk about his parents then proceeded to say his parents hit him all the time.  J seems to understand that his comments attract attention and that he is trying to deflect attention away from his own behaviour.

 

On 28.11.13 J said to his teacher in front of other children that he had a gun at his house, following his saying that he loves his parents. His final remark was "that's all I wanted to say" again indicating an attention seeking performance. 

 

On 30.1.14 J said his parents poked him in the eye. It is inherently unlikely that both parents did that, and I note that the consequences of eye poking were not detected on J. 

 

On 1.2.14 MR noted some of  L's hair was missing. L said MH had cut it because it was dirty. On 20.2.14 L repeated to MR that MH had cut her hair with scissors because it was dirty, and said that MH had lied to the GP the day before when she informed him that the hair came out because her mum braided it too tight. The foster carer says that the hair was braided too tightly. The GP note adds nothing evidentially to this. 

 

On 21.2.14, after a visit to MR, L got upset when told she was going back to MH, and said MH twisted her arm, MR demonstrated when giving evidence what L had shown her.

 

The Social Workers met L at the contact centre. L said she had been with MH to the GP, and then went on to say she went to the dentist. L alleged that MH twisted her hand so much, she slapped her, she always makes her cry, and she slapped her so hard. Then when asked L said she had been slapped once by MH. She elaborated upon this by saying that she had been taken to the dentist, got a sticker and pointed to a gap in her teeth. MH says L did not go to the dentist but to the GP. The LA investigated and concluded that these allegations are unsubstantiated. It is not my role in this hearing to determine if the foster carer hurt L. I can note is that the foster carer said that she has experienced L lying to her and maintaining the lies even though the truth can be seen. I can also note that the LA relies on the truth of what L says about her parents, but not about her complaints relating to her foster carer. 

 

MR looked after J from August 2012 to August 2013 then since 19.9.13. She says in her statement that as time has gone on she has found that J will tell lies and can make things up as he goes along especially when he feels he has an audience. She told the court it can be difficult to know when he is lying; sometime he smirks sometimes not, and may say outlandish things like "my daddy eats doors". 

 

DISCUSSION

Ms CT an Independent Social Worker (ISW) was involved in the previous proceedings and re-instructed in these. She has over 30 years' experience in child protection. She had said in her reports that she recommended a veracity expert be instructed. I had ruled that one was not needed. I refused an application by the mother to instruct a child psychiatrist to advise as to veracity. In fact Ms CT said in evidence that she did not recommend such a psychiatrist but an ISW expert in interpreting ABE interviews. Does the fact she made this recommendation detract from her evidence? I did not think so, and found her fair compelling and helpful. She sets out her considerable concern about the ABE process in her report, with which I agree. She told the court that upon watching the ABE she sensed no distress or anxiety from L. I agree with her completely. 

 

Her professional view, which I accept, is that the mother has undergone a major change since the commencement of the earlier proceedings in August 2012 and that she felt she would know if the mother was lying to her. 

I agree with her that it is troubling that the children have actually made complaints of physical harm. Her professional view is that they cannot be perceived as truthful in origin.

Ms CT told the court that she felt the children had been removed prematurely when L and J had only been home a few weeks and had not been given an opportunity to settle. 

In evidence she gave a great deal of consideration to the possibility put to her that the children have a memory of the assault on P, and by P on her aunt MP.

Dr H, Child Psychiatrist also reported in the previous proceedings. She found L's accounts in interview credible on the subject of her being hurt by her mother. Dr H has not been trained on ABE interview techniques since the 1980s and has not re-read the guidelines recently. She placed reliance upon on the emotional presentation of the children. This was not noted by me when I watched ABE of  L, and as set out earlier, there is clear evidence from MR of J crying when alleging assault by K which was clearly untrue. 

 

In her own interview with L Dr H asked her what happens if she is naughty. When L said "nothing" Dr H said that sometimes when people are angry they shouted or smacked. Then L said "she shouted and she slapped". At paragraph 95 of her report Dr H skims over this exchange and her role in it by saying, baldly, "L told me her mother shouted and slapped".

I was very concerned to read these parts of the report. Dr H had not accept L saying "nothing" in response to her question and Dr H herself suggested shouting or smacking. Dr H herself agreed in evidence that this was not the ideal way of getting information from L. It gave me real concerns about the way Dr H had approached her instruction. 

However, by the end of her oral evidence she appeared to be saying that: the children have experienced physical harm, the degree extent and timing is hard to determine, and it is heightened by their experience of the assault by the mother on P, and P on MP�.it is likely the children experienced some treatment they don't like�..I don't see L as being deliberately untruthful but I accept a degree of confusion and a degree of emotion as to P�..What I am not sure of is how much of it was new behaviour in the 5 weeks at home, I suspect the mother was attempting to manage L's challenging behaviour�..I can see the deficiencies of the ABE interview�.I find it difficult that a child makes allegations against a parent when they want to be with that parent without there being truth in it�..I feel convinced that there's no reason L and J made a series of allegations if the period home had not been aversive [sic]�..Children who are not verbal do have powerful memories (when  asked if they could remember pre August 2012).

 

The LA relies on Dr H to support their contention that the court should make the findings. Dr H conceded that the ABE interview had deficiencies, she herself conducted quite leading examination of L, she agreed that it was not possible to separate the children recounting from their own experience from what had happened to P and that even though that was back in August 2012 children do have powerful memories. 

 

The more I heard from Dr H the more I felt her oral evidence had moved significantly away from her written reports.  

 

No complaint was ever made by the children to the Children's Guardian who has seen them in a variety of settings in both proceedings.

 

The parents each gave clear and measured evidence. They are clearly bewildered and frustrated by this second process. I gained the clear view that the mother lives daily with the consequences for her family of her assault on P. They both appeared uncomprehending of why the children have said what they have. They deny any assault on either of L or J. I did not get the impression that either was covering up for the other. They were cross examined by Counsel for the LA about the allegations. I was impressed by the mother's quiet dignity in such trying circumstances as this case, which she knows began with her originally. I found each of them quite credible witnesses.

 

The children's various statements lack any context as to time, date and surrounding circumstances. They are never asked by the adults, tell me more, or are you sure, who else was there, who saw this. The allegations against the parents appear to have been accepted by the LA at face value, unlike the allegations made about others eg MH.

 

There is no medical evidence to corroborate the allegations of ill treatment. To the contrary the Child Protection medical notes they are well cared for. 

 

The parents had worked hard to achieve the children's return home in August 2013, after a year's separation. The mother had a criminal conviction relating to her assault on another child. The parents were under scrutiny from a variety of professionals from 11.8.13 to 19.9.13, with a 12 months Supervision Order, Social Work visits at least once a week, Family Support Worker, school, SALT attendance, GP attendance, probation and the mother having had a suspended sentence of imprisonment. There is no evidence of their inability to control the children's behaviour appropriately. It is inherently unlikely that the parents having been closely observed in supervised contact for a year would during the 5 week period which they describe as "joyous" beat, hit, punch and flick their 2 children, 2 children in relation to whom there had never been a previous allegation of abuse. The contact notes refer to appropriate and happy times spent in supervised contact, and no allegation was ever made by either child against the father during his unsupervised contact times.

 

The mother was engaged with the programme of work set out by the LA. During this 5 week period there was no concern raised by any professional about the care the children were receiving, the school felt the children settled well, and that she engaged well with the school, and the children's behaviour was not of any concern. 

 

The first complaint made by J on 12.6.13 was clearly false. A momentum seems to have built since then. The professionals who knew J from nursery school agreed he had SALT difficulties. 

 

Both children have made some demonstrably untrue assertions. Those who have provided care for L have known her to make false assertions, MR and MH. Both children have enjoyed the attention their remarks have brought. Both children refer to hitting their parents back which leads one to imagine that they are "fighting" in play rather than abuse. When the children have made remarks about their parents hurting them, they have not been accompanied by signs of fear or distress. To the contrary the remarks are often made accompanied by positive remarks about their parents and/or wanting to go home or see them. J has been obviously distressed when making allegations against his cousin, which were in fact untrue. 

 

J makes numerous allegations mentioning his father, it is surprising that L makes no reference to these if they had indeed occurred. This suggests that any allegations J makes against his father are unreliable. 

 

Why are children saying these things, about their parents and other adults and children? It is not necessary for me to decide this in order to make fact finding decisions (Re M 2013 2FLR 874) but I have tried to look at all of the evidence and work it out.

 

I consider it likely that these 2 children are confused about the return home, trying to make sense of why (and it from the Social Workers' evidence that no real work was carried out with them about that) and confused at then being separated from each other again. MR told the court that no specific advice was given to her as to preparing J for his return home. CB told the court that she could not recall any specific work being done with the children or their carers to prepare for the return home. GE has produced 2 file notes of visits. Having read these I am not satisfied that any proper explanatory and preparatory work was done with the children to explain their permanent return home, and I accept MRs' evidence that she received no advice about this. This may well have contributed to the children's confusion. The exercise which the 2 Social Workers carried out on 9.7.13 and 18.7.13 respectively with a drawing of 3 houses and talking about who lives in each may well have caused confusion. 

 

Dr H and Ms CT agreed that the children's statements could reflect their trying to process the significant events of the past ie the mother's assault on P and P's assault on her aunt MP. Perhaps they were trying to make sense of why they had been removed from their parents care in August 2012? Perhaps they were unsure how long they would remain there? Ms CT thought this might fit. Dr H said it was not possible to separate what may be the children's experience of the parents, and what may be trauma from other incidents they have witnessed

 

It is accepted that the children had frequent contact with P from August 2012, L was placed with P initially. It is more likely than not that the children will have heard P talk about being hit by their mother. MR told the court that the family (rightly) disapproved of the mother's assault on P and that the family spoke about this when the children were both in and out of the house. 

 

Ms C said that J was desperate for attention a lot of the time. His allegations made in June and September gave him attention it seems. I accept MRs' evidence that J liked to have an audience, as his carer for over a year she will know him well. 

 

It appears that hitting and rough play was part of the children's lives, with each other and with their cousins. 

 

On 19.9.13 as every day L and J had a lot of access to each other in class and in playground. Once school ended at 3.15pm they had open access to each other until the police arrived almost 2 hours later. I have dealt with this in some detail in the chronology above. 

 

The parents co-operated with the children leaving with the Social Workers on 19.9.13, this co-operation is likely to have assisted the children. The mother says that J had wet himself; she felt this as she hugged him, there was no challenge to this evidence. CB said there was further wetting since the parents had left. I cannot draw from the LA evidence that the children showed little distress which is in some way corroborative of a complaint of ill treatment.

 

ALLEGATION 10

 

The LA relies on evidence that J was aggressive in the waiting room for the Child Protection medical and hit a child. Given that J had been removed from school by Social Workers the day before, taken to his aunt's home, taken to hospital for a medical, if he was acting out, there is no possible connection to his mother's care in my judgment. He was probably very confused by the events of the preceding day and weeks. 

According to his teacher there was nothing remarkable about J's behaviour until after he was removed on 19.9.13. The Headteacher Ms S said the incidents of concern seemed to have occurred after this date. 

The parents had supervised contact with the children; any suggestions from the children that they were being aggressive because the mother told them to are incompatible with the contact supervision records which reveal nothing of the sort. I have not been shown all of the contact notes but the LA has referred me to various notes on different points. 

Any incidents of aggression cannot be linked to parental care.

I have considered with some care all of the oral and written evidence and ABE interview. The evidence taken as a whole does not come even close to the necessary standard of proof of a balance of probabilities. I am not at all satisfied that either parent together or apart has physically harmed L or J. The allegations in the schedule 2-12 are dismissed.

 

WORKING WITH PROFESSIONALS

 

The LA seeks a finding that "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals." 

The LA asserts in submissions that the parents are able to work with some professionals at times and that that their engagement is not always consistent. This is probably accurate. 

At the time of the making of the Supervision Order on 12.9.13 the parents were willing to sign a Working Agreement but at that stage the father was not convinced of the need for him to engage in the Family Recovery Project given the evidence in the earlier proceedings. He said in evidence that he was willing to consider engaging in the Family Recovery Project but had not come to a decision (by 7 days later when this case began again) wanting more information as to its time commitments and how it might affect his college/work before he decided. The father has not sought to prevent the mother or the children engaging.

 

The mother did not want the children to see her sisters until she had resolved the issues in the sisters' relationship and wanted to introduce contact when she felt it appropriate. The mother did not want the Social Workers to see children at school, but was willing for them to be seen at home. She submitted a Supervision Order was not necessary, given that she had agreed to the amended Written Agreement. There is no issue that the mother has engaged with the services set out in the working agreement. 

 

The LA submits that they rely on the fact that there were difficulties in reaching an agreement with the parents at court on the last day on the previous proceedings on 12.9.13.

I cannot see how the LA can rely on this as a relevant factor in this Threshold Criteria in these proceedings. It was of great importance to the Social Workers who gave evidence before me; they kept referring back to it and to the one missed SALT appointment for J. In any event the LA provided a "Schedule of Requirements" document on 12.9.13, it was rightly re-titled "Working Agreement" but the LA still sought that it be signed up to. After legal advice and discussions the parents made it clear that they would sign the amended "Working Agreement" document which I have seen. It is entirely reasonable, and I note that the District Judge went on to make Supervision Orders, agreeing that the children's welfare was best met in the care of their parents. 

I am entirely satisfied that the parents have worked openly with a number of professionals namely CAMHS, Ms CT, the police, the mother with probation, the school and the Children's Guardian.

 

The parents have attended all core group, Child Protection meetings and Looked After Children reviews from August 2012 to date. The mother did not attend J's first SALT appointment; she has attended the rest successfully. Her probation officer on 16.7.13 suggested the distance to the SALT was excessive for the parents.

The mother has engaged and co-operated with Meanwhile Therapy, and willing to engage with the Family Recovery Project. GE in cross examination accepted that there was very little the parents haven't got the children to and that the parents have put in an incredible amount of effort. He said that the father was for the most part reasonable and easy to work with. 

On 19.9.13 according to the school staff the parents co-operated patiently in the most difficult of circumstances.

The parents have demonstrated a working relationship with a number of professionals. 

The parents have been living under huge strain. The children returned home after one year and then all 3 were removed after 5 weeks of L and J at home, baby KR then aged less than 4 months. Despite a positive kinship assessment of the father's mother upon the LA's own instruction, the Social Work team refused to place any of the children with her, and have not provided any real explanation as to why they do not follow this positive recommendation. The LA position one week after removal last September was that there should be no further assessments or rehabilitation. I agree with Ms CT that this was completely inappropriate.

 

The mother wished to breast feed baby KR, it took the LA 2 weeks to provide a breast pump. This is hardly working in co-operation with parents who hold parental responsibility. 

The LA relies on inappropriate comments made by the parents in contact and 4 contact notes were provided. I will be frank; I thought I had been given the wrong notes. There is almost nothing untoward at all in these notes. The mother is referred therein to being discreet in her discussions with the supervisor and if anything I was pleased to read such positive accounts from the independent sources at contact.

I am not at all satisfied that "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals."  

Even if I were so satisfied � in circumstances where no other finding is made, this one line alone cannot found the basis for threshold criteria being met. 

The parents mistrust the Social Work team. There is a Supervision Order in force, the LA must advise, assist and befriend the family. The parents must allow them to do this. I strongly encourage senior management to approve a change of SW team. A fresh approach to this family is vital. Working in co-operation with this team would be very difficult for any family given the Social Workers' clear view, even before the fact finding hearing, that the children could not be returned to their parents, a Social Work team who made arrangements for an adoption family finding Social Worker to visit the children during the days of this hearing (fortunately this was stopped before it took place), a Social Work team who have not, in my view, taken a proportionate and measured view of the evidence as it arose. 

The LA were right to investigate once J had made his allegations, but a proper and detailed analysis of the evidence leads me in no doubt at all that the findings sought should be dismissed.

 

I encourage the father to find out more about the Family Recovery Project and to give it serious consideration. 

 

The 2 children need therapeutic input to help them make sense of the events of their young lives. 

The Threshold Criteria not being met, I encourage the parties to have discussions about the children's return home, how they can be prepared for that and how it can be properly explained, I fully expect the parents to co-operate with a s20 agreement for a short time to enable the return home to have the best possible chance of success.

DRAFT JUDGMENT

 

 

1.                 
THE JUDGE:� I am concerned with
the welfare of A, born on 28th December 2012, who is therefore just
over 15 months of age.� She is the subject of proceedings brought by Lancashire
County Council, who have been represented by Miss Bowcock of counsel during the
proceedings before me.� Her mother is M, who has been represented by Mr Senior
of counsel.� M was born on 27th February 1991, and is now 23 years
of age.� She is still, I think, married to father, F, who has been represented
by Miss Korol of counsel during the proceedings before me.� They were married
in October 2010, having been involved in a relationship since the mother was 16
years of age.� F is 32, having been born on 7th July 1982.� The
parents separated, I am going to find, in May of 2013, only shortly after A was
born. �The mother is now involved in a relationship with Z, who has been an
intervener in these proceedings, born on 13th May 1982 and he is
also 31, nearly 32, years of age.� Z is represented by Mr Entwistle of counsel
in these proceedings.� Mother�s parents are MGF and MGM.� They have also become
interveners in these proceedings in circumstances that I will come to describe
and they had been heavily involved, up until A came into care, in her care.� They
have been represented by Miss Akerman of counsel.

2.                 
The reason for these proceedings
can be briefly outlined.� At about 3:00am in the morning on Friday, 16th
August 2013, the father made a call to an NSPCC 24 hour helpline to
discuss his concerns about bruising that he had observed to A.� Although he had
noticed the bruising earlier in the week, his call at that time was prompted by
the fact that he had only just been made aware, during the evening of Thursday,
15th August, that his wife was now involved in a relationship with Z.�
He connected the fact of the bruising with the fact of the relationship.� As a
result of that call, social services and the police were involved by the NSPCC
and they went early to the maternal grandparents� home where A had been staying
overnight.� She was then taken to Hospital A where she was examined by a
consultant paediatrician, Dr Y,� Her conclusions about what she saw are
contained in a report that I have in the bundle at E2.� She sets out what she
found on examination and what she found was also photographed.� 

3.                 
The injuries that she saw were as
follows:-


 
  0.5 centimetre circular
      bruise to the inside of the mid right upper arm.� 
  1.5 by 0.2 centimetre
      linear blue bruise to the middle of the right thigh.� 
  1.5 by 0.5 centimetre
      blue bruise with a few dark purple petechiae, she says �(broken blood
      vessels)� by way of explanation, to the inside of the left lower thigh.� 
  1 centimetre circular
      pale brown bruise to the outer edge of the left mid buttock.� 
  1 centimetre by 0.5 centimetre
      brown bruise to the left upper thigh, just below the left buttock.� 
  0.5 centimetre circular
      brown bruise to the middle of the back of the left thigh.� 
  a few large petechiae
      (again broken blood vessels) to the inner edge of the back of the right
      knee.� 
  0.1 centimetre by 1.5
      centimetre linear brown mark to the outer edge of the back of the right
      upper thigh.� 
  0.2 centimetre circular
      bluish coloured bruise to the right buttock.� 
  a 1 centimetre by 1 centimetre
      brown bruise above and medial to injury nine to the right buttock.� 
  2.5 centimetre by 2.5
      centimetre area of brown discolouration just above the outer edge of the
      right buttock to the lower back.�

Dr Y said this:

��A is a 7 month old non-mobile child who presents
with multiple bruising to her legs, buttock, back and right arm, with no
history given as to how they have occurred.� The history given by mum that the
bruising may have been caused by the car seat straps is not consistent with the
extensive bruising found on examination.� Injuries seen on A are not likely to
have been caused by accident and especially as there is no history to explain
them they would be consistent with non-accidental injury.�

5.                 
As a result of that opinion, A
remained in foster care, I think initially under Section 20 of the Children
Act, by the agreement of the parents. These proceedings were commenced on 2nd
September 2013.� The case first came before me on 17th October 2013
when I was persuaded to permit the instruction of an independent paediatrician
to give expert evidence in these proceedings in anticipation of a fact-finding
hearing when those conclusions by Dr Y would be in issue, as well as the issue
of what had actually occurred to A to cause the bruises if that was what they
turned out to be. �The issue that was identified to me as necessitating the
instruction of an expert was whether the use of a steroid nappy cream might
increase susceptibility to bruising.� At that point, the Local Authority and
the children�s guardian agreed that whilst there was an intellectual
possibility that the maternal grandparents, who had had a lot to do with A before
she came into foster care, were in the pool of possible perpetrators of injury
the possibility was no more probable than intellectual.� They, therefore, did
not need to be made parties to intervene in the fact-finding proceedings and I
listed the matter before His Honour Judge Lancaster, who was available to hear
it during the first working week of the year far earlier than I would have been.

6.                 
�Dr Mecrow, a consultant
paediatrician, was duly instructed and reported on the injuries.� Inexplicably,
he did not seem to be provided with either a full set of notes or photographs
from Hospital A at the time of his report. This meant that he ended up having
to give oral evidence before His Honour Judge Lancaster.� Dr Mecrow did not
consider the use of steroid cream was related to the bruising, which he
concluded was unusual, and he rejected the explanations for the bruising that had
been put forward by the mother at that stage.� He referred to research which demonstrates
that even babies who are cruising, in other words pulling themselves up and
moving around on their feet, very rarely have more than six bruises in total.�
He was also very concerned by the sites of A�s bruising.� He overall came to
the conclusion that the bruising was highly likely to have been the result of a
non-accidental mechanism.� 

7.                 
It does seem to me that the expert
evidence in this case simply confirms that each of those separate bruises in the
absence of any underlying medical condition causing either bruising or a
susceptibility to bruising represents a separate application of force to A
sufficient to cause bruising.� Dr Mecrow�s report shows that in a child of her
age and development who is not cruising (and she was not), it would be
extraordinarily unlikely that she would be sustain more than a couple of
bruises on any site of her body without her carers being precisely aware of
what had happened to her to cause them.� 

8.                 
Dr Mecrow was required to attend
to give evidence at the hearing in Lancaster before HHJ Lancaster because there
was some doubt whether particular blood clotting tests had been untaken.� That
doubt was resolved by the provision of the notes to Dr Mecrow.� Furthermore, he
was able at that point to reject another possible mechanism of causation.� This
had been advanced by the mother in a late statement setting out a rather
unusual incident that she said had taken place on or about 9th
August 2013 in which� she said that A had managed to roll off a large bed, from
the middle of that large bed where she had been placed.� Mother had not found
any bruising after this incident, although she said it had caused a red mark on
A�s back.� However, in any event, Dr Mecrow did not consider that that
mechanism would have caused the bruising or the extent of the bruising that was
found on 16th August.

9.                 
As I understand it, all of the
parties before me now agree that the evidence establishes that the bruising to
A must have been inflicted by an adult.� The task I embarked upon was to hear
the evidence in order to determine who is in the pool of possible perpetrators
of those injuries and, if possible, to narrow matters down to one perpetrator
and also to look at the culpability of any other person in terms of failure to
protect A.� I consider that I have heard enough evidence also to consider the
protective capacity in the future of each of the relevant people.

10.             
The hearing before His Honour
Judge Lancaster had to be adjourned for reasons which become apparent later in
this judgment.� The evidence establishes the following chronology of the
crucially important days prior to A�s bruises being seen by Dr Y on Friday, 16th
August commencing on Friday 9th August 2013.� As I understand it, on
Friday, 9th August, A was in the care of her
maternal grandparents overnight.� On Saturday, 10th August, she
went into the care of her father and she was with him overnight.� On Sunday, 11th
August, she was returned to the care of her mother at about 2:00pm.� The father
had asked to have her until 4:00pm, but that had been declined.� She was bathed
that night and a photograph of her in her baby bath was taken which establishes
that date.� The mother says that at that point, she had perhaps one or two
bruises to her inner thigh, about where car seat straps might go.� At some
point, that bruising was discussed by the mother with her mother, who had
herself drawn previously to the attention of the mother a red mark to A�s ear.�
Both mother and grandmother are now adamant that that mark to the ear was a
scratch or a spot and not a bruise, although it seems to me likely that the
maternal grandmother used the term �bruise� when first describing it to the
first social worker involved in the case, Adam Starkey.

11.             
On Monday, 12th August,
during the morning, A was cared for by the maternal grandparents whilst
mother and Z went to Social Club B together for work purposes.� That day, I
assume in the afternoon, after A had been returned to mother and Z, the
maternal grandparents went to the Citizens Advice Bureau to find out about
their rights as grandparents.� That date is a date proffered by the grandmother
which I assume is ascertained by her from correspondence that has not been
disclosed within the proceedings to confirm the date of the appointment.� A was
in the care of her mother and Z overnight on Monday, 12th August.�
They initially said she had been bathed that night, but both now assert that
she was in fact bathed only �on the Sunday night as per the photographs.� 

12.             
During the morning of Tuesday, 13th
August, it is now established that the mother went to Social Club B, which was
her place of employment and Z�s place of employment, from before 9:00am until
approximately 12:30pm, those times being established from text communications
between them.� Z was at home with A.� He was ill with some kind of gastric
malady.� The issue of whether anyone else was there with him for all or part of
that time is a question I need to determine on the evidence I heard last week.�
A was then handed over to the care of her father at about 1:00pm or 1:30pm.� He
says he noticed the bruising between 5:00pm and 5:30pm that day, having been to
Location C with his older sister for the afternoon.� He says that he both
texted and telephoned the mother about that bruising.� A remained in his care
until Thursday, 15th August at about 1:00pm, apart from a
couple of hours on Wednesday, 14th August when he played football
and in the absence of his mother, with whom he was living then, he asked the
maternal grandparents, MGF and MGM, to look after A.� They did so gladly.�
Father thinks he discussed the bruising that he had first noticed on the
Tuesday with them on the Wednesday when he collected A.� They deny that he ever
did so.� 

13.             
Father returned A to the mother�s
care at about 1:00pm on Thursday, 15th August.� She transferred her
straight to the care of her parents, it being said by her that by then she also
was suffering the same gastric malady that had afflicted Z on the Tuesday.� The
maternal grandmother and the father had a telephone conversation during the
evening of Thursday, 15th August.� They are in dispute about what
the primary subject matter of that conversation was, but during it, it is clear
the father became aware that in fact the mother was now in a relationship with Z
and that Z was now playing a large role in his daughter�s life.� 

14.             
At some point during those days
that I have just outlined, someone inflicted sufficient force upon A as to
cause the bruising seen by Dr Y and photographed at the hospital on 16th
August.� The evidence, as I have said, I heard was to enable me to narrow the
pool of possible perpetrators and identify, if possible, who that was.� 

15.             
I turn to the law.� The law that
applies to this fact-finding exercise is not contentious or complicated.� I am
required to weigh the evidence to enable me to make findings or not on a simple
balance of probabilities.� If the evidence allows me to say that I consider
something is more likely than not, then I can find that something as a fact.�
The old-fashioned contention that the more serious the allegation the more
evidence required to prove it has long since, to use the words of Baroness
Hale, been given its quietus.� 

Re B (Care Proceedings:
Standard of Proof) [2008] UKHL 35.� 

Equally, so far as the identification of perpetrator
is concerned, that exercise also simply requires a finding on the balance of
probabilities.� It is in the public interest and the interest of children the
subject of proceedings that the perpetrator of injuries should be identified if
possible.� 

Re K (Non-accidental injuries: Perpetrator: New
Evidence) [2004] EWCA Civ 1181.� 

However, if the evidence does not permit such a
finding and I am genuinely uncertain after weighing and considering it, I have
a duty to say so because it would be dangerous to strive to identify a single
perpetrator based upon speculation and not upon the evidence.� 

Re D (Care Proceedings: Preliminary Hearing) [2009] EWCA Civ 472.� 

I should, however, identify who is in the pool of
possible perpetrators where the evidence leaves a real possibility in each
instance that that person inflicted injuries.

North Yorkshire County Council v SA [2003] EWCA Civ 839 as approved in the Supreme Court
in Re SB [2009] UK SC 17.� 

16.             
In this case, it seems to me, as I
think I have indicated during the arguments, that more than one of the family
members who gave evidence have demonstrated a rather too casual deference to
the notion that they should tell the truth and I am satisfied that deliberate
lies have been told during the evidence.� I must, however, remind myself in a
quasi Lucas jury direction to myself that I cannot assume that the telling of
such lies permits me to infer that the liar in each case is responsible either
for inflicting injuries upon A or for failing to protect her from those
injuries, other than, of course, by failing to tell the truth and thereby to
risk either a dangerous outcome, at worst or, at best, prevent any scheme for
her protection to be precisely targeted.� 

17.             
I turn to the evidence and my impressions
of the witnesses.� This case occupied five full days of evidence.� I heard
evidence first from Adam Starkey, who, as I have already said, was the social
worker in the case for the first few weeks and was the first to meet and talk
with the family when the injuries came to light.� His evidence was extremely
valuable to me in allowing me to see the state of mind of each of the parties
at that point and, in particular, the thinking then of the maternal
grandparents.� His evidence before His Honour Judge Lancaster had been that he
had taken notes on the day of the events, which were recorded on that day on
the Lancashire County Council ISSIS system.� He had no independent recollection
of the events.� His evidence and his note demonstrate that he is a competent
professional and likely to have kept records which are largely accurate.� His
observations of the mother�s care of A at hospital were entirely positive.� 

18.             
I �next heard from the present key
social worker.� She is Claire Peace and has been a social worker for 17 years.�
She had undertaken the viability and core assessments of the key parties and
relatives and she impressed me as an assiduous and highly competent
professional.� During one of her assessment sessions with the father, he had
shown her on his mobile phone WhatsApp messages that he said had sent to the
mother, apparently on Tuesday, 13th August, in which he had
told the mother of the bruises he had found on A and enquired whether A had
fallen.� Later in the bundle, there is a screenshot of what the father says Claire
Peace was shown.� There are slight differences.� At C36 Claire Peace relates,
�On 13.8.13 at 15:51 he wrote, �Has she fallen as there are more bruises?�� He
then spoke to her on the phone.� At 20:36 he texted her to say, �Let you know
asleep and in some discomfort.��� At C156 the screenshots read, �Has she fallen
at all coz there are more bruises?�� That was sent at 17:21.� Then a message,
�She asleep now but she seemed to be in discomfort.�� That was sent at 20:36.� Unfortunately,
despite his best efforts, I find, the father�s telephone entry code could not
be got past by the telephone interrogators later instructed to look at each
party�s mobile phone.� It seems to me, however, that the essential meaning of
the messages at C36 and C156 is exactly the same.� 

19.             
Claire Peace gave evidence that
she had attempted to record exactly what she saw.� In their submissions, the
Local Authority conceded that the difference between the screenshots and her
record was more likely to be a slightly inaccurate transcription by her than
any faking of messages by the father.� I agree with that submission, although
without any criticism of her because the essence was accurate.� This is not an
example of treating father�s inconsistencies differently from the mother as
she, in the submissions made for her by Mr Senior, complains this is the
approach.� If those are fake messages then it seems most unlikely that, having
installed fake messages on his phone, the father would then change them so as
to make them read slightly differently.� The mother in fact denies receiving
them and they were not shown at all on her phone when that was interrogated.�
However, somewhat mysteriously, her telephone revealed no WhatsApp messages at
all for a long period of some weeks at the relevant point despite regular use
of it at other points.� 

20.             
Claire Peace had undertaken a full
assessment session with Z.� He spent nearly an hour without letting her
intervene much at all.� He spent that hour being negative about the father and his
home conditions and making many arguments that might cause someone to infer
that the injuries were caused whilst A was in her father�s care.� Not much time
was left to the social worker to ask questions of Z and she felt that his
approach was an attempt to control her.� The information he relayed in any
event was not information of which he had much first-hand knowledge at all.� 

21.             
The first family member from whom
I heard was M, the mother.� In general, she was a very poor witness.� Her
accounts were riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions.� She did not
even try to disguise her dissembling of facts she considered not to look good,
even at one point expressly admitting that was her approach to the evidence.�
She said, �Why would I say that?� It doesn�t look good.�� She did not seem to
feel any obligation to deal in facts and truths, but rather tried to stick to
an account that was the least damaging to her and to Z.� She did not always
succeed and, at times, her dissembling seemed ridiculous.� She did not appear
to have any appreciation of why it is in A�s best interests and necessary for
her future protection that there should be a proper investigation and
consideration of what happened to her.� 

22.             
Her evidence also revealed that
her lifestyle has become one of repeated nights drinking and clubbing and
staying out late, with occasional casual sexual encounters.� It does seem to me
that there is a distinction between that and the social life which her parents
lead, which is heavily pub centred, which she and I think the father also used
to join.� It is a rather degraded and degrading lifestyle, which puts her own
safety at risk at the very least.� It is also quite incompatible with being a
parent, even when conducted on the nights when A was not with her.� If nothing
else, it is likely to have caused her to be extremely tired.� I cannot fathom
why this mother allowed herself to sink to such levels of degraded and
degrading conduct. �It seems to me that it would be very much in the interests
of A that the mother should now seek to turn that around, whatever role she is
to play in the future in this child�s life.

23.             
She tried to explain why she and
the father had broken up after having been together since she was 16.� It appeared
to me that she resented no longer being the entire focus of his affection after
A was born, although this resentment seems, in fairness, only to have affected
her relationship with him and not her relationship with A.� She told me how Z
had treated her well and how it was Z who suggested that the father�s contact
with A should be more structured.� The regime that was devised in fact involved
the mother then having A in her care only two and a half nights a week on
average.� A spent every Friday night with the maternal grandparents and every
Saturday night with the father.� She would spend alternate Sunday nights with
her mother or her father.� She would spend Monday nights with her mother.� She
would spend Tuesdays and Wednesdays with her father and Thursdays with her
mother, although in the key week for the causation of the injuries A was in
fact with the maternal grandparents on the Thursday night as well.� 

24.             
The mother told me how she had
briefly resumed her sexual relationship with the father over a period when she
and Z were temporarily separated during July 2013.� Z had, at the time of the
hearing only just become aware of this, though he had apparently questioned her
closely about some left over Chinese food in the freezer at her home being food
which she had shared in a meal with the father. She had initially told Z that
the meal she had shared was with the paternal grandmother.� The mother was
insistent that Z had only looked after A once on his own for any length of
time, although he might have had charge for very short periods when she nipped
to the shops from her home.� The only longer period that she conceded was a
period had occurred outside the window of possible perpetration of the
injuries, namely on a Friday evening when she had worked at the Public House D for
the evening early in August. That period of working is another example of her
casual dishonesty because she previously represented that on that day she had
been visiting her father because she was worried about his health.� She
conceded this had been a false account because she worried about the
implications for her benefit entitlement of having been working at Public House
D.� 

25.             
The mother insisted that her
parents had simply failed to understand her own defaults in keeping Z informed
of her whereabouts when they had initially in these proceedings described him
as controlling because of his constantly texting the mother to find out what
she was doing and where she was.� That explanation (namely that the texts were
prompted by mother�s defaults) was parroted throughout the evidence of the
maternal family members and of Z and I consider it to be very strange.� The
explanation for the controlling conduct does not demonstrate that it was not
controlling, but rather that this family have been rather too ready to take on
somewhat distorted reasoning to mitigate what was originally, it seems to me,
quite justified criticism of Z�s attitude.� 

26.             
The mother went through the week
prior to A�s injuries coming to light.� I do not propose to go through precisely
what she said here, but rather to go through what I find to be the chronology
for that week with reference to all the evidence I heard about. The� mother
told me of two other incidents that have occurred this year, which have
emerged, sadly, not through frank self reporting by the family, but from police
disclosure.� On 13th February 2014, the police were called to an
alleged assault upon the mother by Z.� He ended up spending the night in the
cells, but the mother did not press charges and he was released without
charge.� She had originally alleged that he had grabbed her by the throat and
pushed her to the ground.� This account became an obviously sanitised one later
and in evidence when the mother insisted that her own behaviour and alcohol
consumption had contributed and provoked Z.� She would not repeat that he had
grabbed her by the throat but rather said, somewhat lamely, and repeatedly that
he had pushed her and caught her neck after she had slapped him round the face,
twice on her account and three times on his.

27.             
A second involvement of the police
took place on 26th March, again not disclosed to the Local Authority
or the guardian or to this court by the statements, related to apparently
threatening texts sent either to the mother or to her mother (I was not shown
them), which included words to the effect of �You�re going down.�� This, the
mother insisted, was after Z had read texts the mother said had simply come up
on her phone by chance when he was watching a football match on it on 25th
March this year.� She insisted that she did not think Z had perpetrated
injuries to A and expressed her guilt that he, an innocent bystander in her
view, had been dragged into these proceedings and involvement.� 

28.             
When she gave her evidence in
chief on Friday, 4th April the mother was separate from Z and living
with her parents.� At the end of that evidence on 4th April I
explained and directed her not to discuss her evidence with anyone.� However, because
I thought that she was about to spend the weekend with her parents, I suggested
that if any such conversation had proved impossible to resist and did take
place, she was to come to court and be open about it.� On Tuesday, 8th
April when this case resumed, Z came to court and instructed his counsel, Mr
Entwistle, that he and the mother had spent Sunday and Monday together and had
extensively discussed the case.� It is not in dispute that that happened and it
is also not in dispute that but for his revealing it that would not have been
revealed by the mother, contrary to very clear instructions I gave her on the
Friday.� As the mother resumed her evidence conceding all that, she also gave
me the very clear impression that she now considered that she and Z were
permanently reconciled.� 

29.             
In cross-examination she had to
agree that the only rational explanation on her case for A�s bruises is that
the father had caused them and then alerted the authorities in an extremely
malicious double bluff to get her and Z or simply her into trouble.� She had no
proper explanation for why no one had revealed until the texts were discovered
on her telephone that she had gone out on Tuesday, 13th August and
left A in the care of Z either with or without her parents.� If I have not yet
included in this relaying of the chronology which is not in dispute, it is
correct that nobody in the maternal family had relayed that information in any
of the statements given either to the police or to this court or to the social
worker prior to the interrogation of the mother�s mobile phone, to which I have
already made reference.� 

30.             
There is an obvious inference that
a false account then came to be concocted when the relevant texts came to
light, which was not rebutted by any of the mother�s explanations. On January,
7th this year, whilst the matter was proceeding before His Honour
Judge Lancaster, a telephone call was made from Court by the solicitor for the
Local Authority to the maternal grandparents because the mother and Z through
their respective advocates had conveyed the explanation for the interrogated
texts revealing Z caring for A on his own on Tuesday, 13th August
in the morning was that in fact the maternal grandparents had been with him
throughout that morning.� When a telephone call was made to the maternal grandparents
by the solicitor for the Local Authority, they confirmed that to be the case,
saying that they had indeed arrived at the mother�s home at quarter to nine in
the morning and remained there until the mother had returned from wherever she
had been.� Subsequently, the grandparents, as I will come to relate, slightly
changed the time of their arrival and more recently, they have withdrawn that
account altogether. It very much appeared, however, that a false account had
been concocted when the texts came to light and the mother was not able to shift
that appearance by any of her explanations when she was cross-examined.

31.             
The mother did confirm that her
mother had asked her about a mark to A�s ear, but insisted that that was a
scratch which she had thought A had inflicted herself with her own
fingernails.� She was asked about being in financial difficulties and seemed to
minimise this, although it is plain from the extraneous evidence that she was
in debt to Bright House, I think, from whom a new bed had been bought and in
debt to her landlord, for approximately two months arrears, �800.� She conceded
that she had recently, when finding herself in the same public house as the
father, texted him and apparently asked him whether he would like one last
night together.� She insisted that this was to try and get something out of
him, an approach that rather reveals a tendency to want to manipulate people.�
However, when her approach was rebuffed she then asked the father by text if he
hated her, to which his reply was, �Let me see, you left our daughter with a
violent thug, lied to me and tried to make me out to be a shit dad.�� Her
evidence about this �was to the effect that she never intended there to be any
reconciliation, but she was simply seeing what she might be able to get out of
the father.� I assume she meant by way of information.� 

32.             
She confirmed also that Z had at
one point pretended to be her and had tweeted messages to the father,
apparently alleging that she had had sex with a number of other people during
her relationship with the father.� I did not hear any evidence about whether
those allegations were true.� She was markedly reluctant to give an account of
what the meeting at Social Club B was about on Monday, 12th August.�
She sought not to answer those questions at all until I directed her to.� 

33.             
I turn to the evidence of Z.� He
told me that he has suffered with his nerves since the age of 16 following a
car accident.� He is prescribed Citalopram, which is an antidepressant.� His
hands shook from time to time during his evidence, as indeed did the mother�s.�
He confirmed during cross-examination a rather evasive account of his
conviction in 2009 for a common assault and of his having been warned for
harassing his ex-partner in December 2012.� He had known the mother for some
time.� Indeed, the mother and the father had their wedding reception at Social
Club B where he worked either as a manager and an employee or as a
self-employed tenant.� He seemed to me to seek to be as vague as possible as to
which period was which, particularly when dealing with the financial
transactions of that club.

34.             
His presentation to me struck me
as remarkably similar to that which was described by Claire Peace.� He spoke
quickly and appeared determined to put over his arguments about the evidence in
this case including as many negatives about the father as was feasible.� He did
not see that his conduct in limiting the access the maternal grandparents had
to the mother�s home at an early point in his relationship with the mother or
his conduct in reviewing her texts or his conduct in frequently demanding
information about her whereabouts from minute to minute as unreasonable.�
Indeed, Mr Entwistle was instructed with each relevant witness and throughout
his submissions to repeat what I have already described as the somewhat feeble
justification for this which Z appears to have managed to persuade the maternal
family to accept.� His justification for requiring the maternal grandparents
not to turn up unannounced at their daughter�s home was an occasion when the
maternal grandmother had come into the bedroom to get A, �after she had been
heard from downstairs. On that occasion Z was lying only partially clothed
under the duvet.� This is an account that causes me in part to question why the
mother was allowing A to remain awake in her cot in a room where he was asleep
in any event.� It seems that prior to his request that the grandparents should
not turn up unannounced, they had been able to come and go from the mother�s
home as they pleased. 

35.             
Z gave a different account from
the mother about the meeting at Social Club B on 12th August.�
He suggested that she was simply there to do some cleaning, whereas her
suggestion seemed to be that he had wanted her to be there to help with
paperwork and to be a witness to his meeting with the owner of the club, who
was not identified during the hearing.� Z seemed to me to be deliberately
non-committal about his status with regards to that club.� He was either an
employed manager or a self-employed tenant.� He explained that he was not VAT
registered.� That explanation is consistent with him being a self-employed
tenant because it would be completely irrelevant were he simply a manager.� He
conceded that he owed the owner �2,000 odd, although the nature of that debt
was not disclosed during the evidence.� He agreed that he had suggested that
that �2,000 debt could be repaid or reduced by his providing the owner with VAT
invoices for beer bought for the club, which would then enable the owner, who
is VAT registered, to reclaim the VAT paid for the beer.� 

36.             
This left with me with a concern
that no one was, therefore, accounting to Customs & Excise the VAT on the
beer that had been sold at the club to its customers.� I did not consider that
an in depth enquiry into those matters was directly relevant to the issues impacting
upon the welfare of A.� However, I do consider that they should be investigated
and I invite the Local Authority to alert HM Customs & Excise to these
matters and to this paragraph of my judgment.� It should be noted in this
regard that the maternal grandparents at an earlier stage had been worried
about what they saw as the amount of cash that the mother seemed to have been
handling at this relevant period to an extent that they even expressed a fear
that the mother had become involved in �money laundering.�

37.             
Z was insistent that the maternal
grandparents had attended the mother�s home on the morning of 13th
August before her departure, in other words, at about 8:45am, and that they had
remained there throughout the morning with him, even though their statements
described a different arrival time, namely, 10:00am, and a quite different
morning from that revealed by the text messages between him and the mother.� He
became quite assertive and argumentative when Miss Akerman, for the maternal
grandparents, put to him that they no longer considered they could have been in
attendance that morning and that their apparent recollections must relate to a
different morning.� It seemed to me that the conspiracy to give a false account
of 13th August was unravelling, but Z�s response was to carry on
talking fast and to seek to control the outcome by ridiculing the stance of the
grandparents either to persuade them or other listeners of the force of his
account without much regard for facts and truth.� 

38.             
His account of his arrest and
detention on 13th February was also delivered rapidly with an
entirely self justificatory agenda.� He repeatedly said that the maternal
grandparents and the mother had been drinking for four hours longer than him,
but in any event he said, he can hold his drink better than them.� He was
deliberately vague about the quarrel that they all agreed had started at the
maternal grandparents� home immediately before the incident.� He asserted that
the mother had slapped his face three times.� He was indignant that a passer-by
had called the police, indignant that he had been detained and plainly regarded
the decision not to charge him with any offence as a complete vindication of
his account.� His account of his reasons for sending the �You�re going down
text� was delivered in a similar vein.� He talked about having had a feeling
that the others were to abandon the Tuesday morning account of the maternal
grandparents being present with him and A for reasons to suit themselves.� 

39.             
He denied trying to manipulate or
control the mother by revealing their transactions over the weekend, the first
weekend of this hearing, 5th and 6th April 2014.� It also
seemed to me that he was undermining and/or controlling her again by withholding
any public commitment to their now having an on-going relationship.� She, it
will be recalled, had expressed a clear impression that she was back in a
permanent relationship with him.� He was not prepared to commit himself to that
when he gave his evidence.� He seemed quite unashamed of sending distressing
and insulting texts to the father from the mother�s phone, purportedly from
her.� 

40.             
Despite his evident anxiety and
nerves during his evidence, he came over as a man who is used to being able to
overwhelm others with his arguments and views and seemed to have an expectation
that the kind of reasoning and persuasion that works in a bar room could also
work in a courtroom.� He had failed to factor in the essential need in a
courtroom for a witness to deal in facts, corroborated where possible and to
answer questions straightforwardly and truthfully rather than to engage in
argumentative assertion and parrying with advocates.� He is more intellectually
able than the other maternal family witnesses.� Nevertheless, he too was a poor
and unimpressive witness by reason of his repeated attempts to talk over and
round the obvious weaknesses in his own account and his refusal simply to
answer straight questions.� 

41.             
I next heard from MGM, the
maternal grandmother.� My impressions of the maternal grandparents as witnesses
should be tempered by my conviction that these are loving grandparents who
would not knowingly or deliberately harm their granddaughter and would not
expose her to harm by anyone else knowingly.� The difficulty is their preference
seems to be to believe that she has not really been harmed at all, except by
the intervention of the Local Authority.� In that I suspect their reasoning has
become diverted by their love for their own daughter and the fact that someone
has worked quite hard to persuade them of some rather warped reasoning in this
case.� MGM has given various accounts of the events of last August.� She was
present at the hospital when A was admitted and her injuries examined and she
talked to Dr Y and F.� She was subsequently interviewed by the police and then
gave a statement to the court prepared by the Local Authority�s solicitor.� At
no point in any of that did she say that she and her husband had been present
at the mother�s home with Z and A on Tuesday, 13th August.� 

42.             
Initially, she had conveyed her
grave anxiety about Z, his apparent controlling behaviour, her worry about a
mark which she then described as a bruise to A�s ear and the fact that she and
her husband had gone to the Citizens Advice Bureau shortly before the injuries
were found.� It turns out that they did so on Monday, 12th August.�
She said in terms that they had been ready to consult with social services
themselves, but that they were worried that this might have meant that A would
be removed from her mother�s care.� Gradually, however, the tone of her
contribution to these investigations seemed to change.� In the first instance,
she seems to have perceived the removal of A from the family as a greater evil
than the injuries that necessitated that removal.� Like all the maternal
family, she made constant references to the day when A was �taken�.� This is
despite the fact that, from day one, the significance as opposed to the gravity
of the injuries A sustained has been repeatedly explained to her. �I do not
consider that the maternal grandparents have yet taken on board the
significance of those injuries for reasons I will come to explain.� 

43.             
The maternal grandmother sought
during her evidence to distance herself from the concerns she had expressed
during the week that the injuries were discovered by seeking to suggest,
firstly, that the Citizens Advice Bureau appointment had mysteriously been
about the mother�s rent arrears and the possibility that she might be evicted.�
I simply could not follow the logic of this and think it far more likely that
the visit was prompted by concerns about Z�s behaviour or perhaps even by the
mark to A�s ear which she now insisted had not been described by her as a
bruise.� Even on her own account, it became clear that the maternal
grandparents were not aware of the extent of the rent arrears that they now suggest
were the cause of the visit to the Citizens Advice Bureau. They� only became
aware of them three days later during a telephone call from an associate of the
mother�s landlord.� Thirdly and rather sadly, it seems to me, the maternal
grandparents sought to suggest that their original opinion that Z was
controlling was unfair because his constant calls and texting of their daughter
whilst she was in their company were in fact justified by her daughter�s
conduct.� 

44.             
On 27th December last
year, the evidence containing the mother�s telephone records was forwarded to her
by her solicitor.� A scrutiny of those records reveals that in fact A had been
in the care of Z at her mother�s home on the morning of 13th August
when the mother had been out.� The first day of the fact-finding hearing before
His Honour Judge Lancaster was occupied by medical evidence, but during it the
significance of the scrutiny of the mobile telephones was discussed.� The
mother and Z, as I have already said, at some point asserted through their
advocates that he had not been alone, but that the maternal grandparents were
there during the morning.� 

45.             
Again, as I have already said, the
Local Authority�s solicitor telephoned the maternal grandparents from court on
7th January to ascertain their account of that morning, only to be
told that they did indeed confirm the mother and Z�s account and suggested that
they had been at their daughter�s home all morning from 8:45am.� This provision
for the mother and Z of a get-out account now rendered it necessary for the
hearing before HHJ Lancaster to be abandoned in order for the maternal
grandparents to be represented.� Plainly, a much more rigorous approach to
their attitude and capacity to protect was now necessary.� Their actions during
the relevant week would also need to be scrutinised because the intellectual
possibility only that they were perpetrators of injury became a larger
possibility which also needed to be more actively scrutinised.� In other words,
they put themselves back into the pool of possible perpetrators by that
account.� The case had to be relisted therefore for a new fact finding hearing
before me, which, of course, could not take place for a further three months.

46.             
The maternal grandparents were
made interveners and got legal representation.� By the time their own team came
to prepare their statements, their account of 13th August was that
they had gone to Plungington to cash in their weekly carer�s allowance at the
Post Office there.� A bank statement was exhibited to the grandmother�s
statement to support this.� It in fact shows that the day on which the money
was cashed was Monday, 12th August, not Tuesday, 13th.�
The statement also said not that they had arrived at 8:45am, but that they had
arrived at 10:00am, which was known,from the texts, to be after their daughter
had gone out. They also were clear that they had not seen her at the point of
their arrival.� That again conflicts with the account of at least Z, if not the
mother�s.� The MGP and F�s accounts of the details of the morning were
different from the account that Z was tied to by reason of the texts.� Their
account was that they had all been in the garden of the mother�s house all
morning with A in the baby walker, whereas his account necessarily gleaned from
the texts is that in fact A had been put down in her cot for a rest. Indeed Z
sent a somewhat gleeful text at the relevant time suggesting that the more she
slept that morning the more awake and, therefore, more difficult she would be
to care for by the father later that day.� 

47.             
In fact, by the time the maternal
grandmother came to give her evidence to me she had retracted her account that
the morning that she and the grandfather described in their statements was 13th
August at all, saying in her evidence that the discrepancies between her
account and that of Z caused her to believe that it must be some other day that
she and the maternal grandfather are recalling.� This is all wholly unsatisfactory.�
I consider it to be overwhelmingly likely that at some point MGF and MGM were
persuaded to offer a false account to avoid this court finding that Z was on
his own with A at all during the crucial period.� The maternal grandparents
realised during mother and Z�s evidence that this would not work and sought to
step away without being open about why they had ever said this in the first
place. 

48.             
The maternal grandmother was in
the witness box I think quite taken aback by the level of scrutiny and challenge
her wavering and varying accounts were subject to.� She seemed to me to have
quite failed to realise the danger to A of her offering a false account.� If it
is right and it seems to be the case of all parties that A has been injured in
the care of her mother and Z, then a false account intended to increase the
chances of her returning to that very situation exposes her to the risk of
injury again.� That reasoning seems simply to have been missed.� 

49.             
MGM gave an account of the events
that led to the police being involved on both 13th February and
26th February.� 13th February seems to have started from
a drunken dispute between maternal family members, the details of which I do
not believe anyone has been entirely frank about.� MGM did not seem to me to
have an adequate appreciation of how poorly the entire events of that evening
reflect upon each of the participants from the very facts of the row to the
failure to alert the social worker to the fact it had happened at all.� That
goes for MGF�s attitude to that incident as well.� 

50.             
Overall, I am sad to say that MGM
struck me as another witness who did not feel bound to tell the truth when that
truth became inconvenient or awkward.� Someone had persuaded her that it was a
good idea to offer the false account of 13th August, just as she had
been persuaded to water down her initial protective response to A�s injuries.�
She has not chosen to explain who that is.� She conceded that the maternal
family, in which I am including Z, have discussed this case when together at
the pub.� Once again, there seems to me to have been a failure to appreciate
that what is good reasoning in the bar room does not work in reality or in the
courtroom. 

51.             
The next family witness was MGF,
the maternal grandfather.� His credibility, sadly, was no more impressive than
his wife�s.� His evidence was broadly supportive and on all fours with that of
his wife.� Like her, he did not seem to have taken on the significance of the
injuries A suffered and appeared to see that the protective action rather than
the injuries themselves to be the more harmful.� He made clear his own
resistance to involving social services in case, as he put it, the �wee�n� were
taken away.�� Like MGM, he seemed to prefer to think of the injuries as having
been caused by accident in the disarray of the father�s mother�s household
where father was residing at the time.� He does not seem to have taken on board
that this is simply not supported by the evidence, which is agreed.� 

52.             
He stuck with MGM�s explanations
of the Citizens Advice Bureau�s visit and failed to see how this contradicted
the claim that the call to the father on Thursday, 15th August was
to ask for his help with the mother�s rent arrears after the maternal
grandparents found out the extent of them, which was on the Thursday evening.�
It seems to me much more likely that they had decided that the time had come
for the father to know the extent of Z�s involvement in his daughter and their
granddaughter�s life.� MGF sought to advance Z�s justification for the constant
texts and calls to the mother, which had so annoyed MGF at the time.�
Strangely, although he did not seem to have a very high opinion of Z, and was
simply resigned to his daughter�s relationship with him.

53.             
The last family witness in the
case was A�s father.� He was a much more impressive witness than the other
family members.� He appeared to me to be doing his best to assist me with facts
that he recalled.� He was obviously deeply distressed by what had happened to A
and also by the separation which has been necessitated by the Local Authority
intervention in these proceedings. He was self-evidently very saddened by
having spent several months of his contact to his daughter being restricted to
only three hours a week.� He seemed bewildered by his separation from the
mother and hurt by her infidelity with Z, which it emerged during the hearing
had started very much earlier than had previously been conceded by her and in
fact at the end of February 2013.� He was clear that he had texted and
telephoned her about the bruising during the early evening of 13th
August and it seems to me that the independent evidence of the screenshots that
he has provided from his telephone, both of the WhatsApp messaging and also of
the call records, confirm this.� He made assiduous efforts to ensure that his
phone could be scrutinised from 17th October 2013 when I ordered
that this should occur and the fact that it had not been done or was not
possible was patently not his fault.� I note in passing that Z�s phone was not
scrutinised, he having most unfortunately lost it a short while after my order
that it should be scrutinised.

54.             
Mr Senior for the mother in
cross-examining the father, properly confronted him with the fact that some of
his statements omitted the fact of the telephone conversation as well as the
text messages.� It seemed to me that he dealt properly with those anomalies, and
I also considered that his narratives were not inconsistent with both texts and
actual conversations having occurred; although the reference to actual
conversations are not made expressly on each occasion he related exchanges
consistent either with a text or real conversation.� Mr Senior also put to him
that his transcribed conversation with the NSPCC emergency line revealed that
he had first noticed the bruises not on Tuesday, 13th, but on
Wednesday.� Father said this was an honest mistake.� I consider that this is
overwhelmingly likely to be true and borne of the fact that the NSPCC
conversation took place in the early hours of Friday, whereas he might well
have been in a mind-set that it was still Thursday when he made the call. He had
been confronted with what he is likely to have found quite traumatic
information from the maternal grandparents about the mother�s conduct and new
relationship that evening.� 

55.             
The mother, through Mr Senior, argues
that a different approach is being taken to his inconsistencies than is being
taken to hers.� That, it seems to me, demonstrates a complete lack of insight
on her part as to the different order of magnitude of the inconsistencies in
her own evidence from his. She also ignores the fact that she openly sought to
tailor her account to something that she thought would look better than the
reality on at least one occasion.� The father was also clear that he had
discussed the bruising with the maternal grandparents and I think it
likely that he had, either on the Wednesday after they had looked A when he
played football or on the Thursday, when I find they called him to reveal the
extent of Z�s involvement and their own anxieties about that involvement.� The
father conceded that he should have sought medical advice as soon as he noticed
A�s bruising.� He realised that had he done so the steps to protect her could
have been taken earlier and without her being put at further risk as
undoubtedly happened when he returned her to the mother�s care before his call
to the NSPCC.� 

56.             
I turn to my findings.� It seems
to me perhaps most convenient and most accessible to consider my findings about
each of the key protagonists, starting with the most credible and least
culpable and working through them.� I turn to the father.� For the reasons I
have outlined in dealing with his evidence, I consider that the father is a
credible witness who was doing his best to assist me and I do not consider that
the few inconsistencies in his evidence are incompatible with that impression.�
The father did not injure A.� His failure to protect her was short-lived and
understandable.� He had no reason to suspect either his wife or her parents of
being capable of deliberately injuring her.� The bruises he saw are highly
significant for child protection professionals, but are not in and of
themselves serious injuries.� I find it entirely understandable that he did not
react protectively until his discovery that Z was playing a major role in his
daughter�s life and that this was causing concern to the maternal
grandparents.� 

57.             
None of the other family members
could in my view advance with any appearance of seriousness a case that in fact
he was the perpetrator of the injuries.� Quite apart from the inherent lack of
likelihood given his personality and demeanour that they knew well, such a
finding would not only involve him injuring A, but also involve him then using
those injuries he knew himself to have caused to cause a lot of trouble for the
mother, the maternal grandparents and Z, purely motivated by malice and
jealousy.� This seems to me to be vanishingly unlikely.� In general, where the
evidence of the father conflicts with the evidence of any other party, I find
it more likely that his account is the true one.

58.             
I turn to MGF and MGM.� Their
evidence was in reality on all fours with each other and my conclusions in
respect of each of them are the same.� I, therefore, consider it appropriate to
outline those conclusions jointly.� The only difference between them is it
seems to me that MGF was probably less directly involved with the physical care
of his granddaughter when she was in their care.� I do not consider that that
difference affects my overall view of them either as possible perpetrators of
the injuries or as people who hold some culpability by failing to protect from
such injuries either now or in the future.� 

59.             
As I have already outlined, MGF
and MGM have a deep love for their granddaughter.� Despite their own health
difficulties, they were delighted to care for her whenever the parents needed
them to and did so gently and well.� I do not consider it likely at all that
either of them would be capable of handling her forcefully or roughly or assaulting
her.� A great deal of their leisure time is spent in public houses.� They spent
their working lives in public houses.� Some licenced premises are not proper
environments for children.� I have deliberately resisted considering this
aspect of the case as a negative factor in and of itself, although there might
be cases in which that might be established.� That issue is not what this case
is all about.� 

60.             
However, MGF and MGM have failed
to protect their granddaughter from the risks that they perceived.� The texts
from MGM to the mother in or about March 2013 show that she was already then
worried that the mother was leading a lifestyle that was incompatible with
caring for A by remaining out drinking and clubbing until the very early
hours.� I think it likely that MGF and MGM were worried about the mark to A�s
ear and also about the inner thigh bruise or bruises pointed out to them.� They
were also worried by Z�s attitude to the mother and to themselves, which they
then characterised as controlling.� Those are the reasons I find they went to
the Citizens Advice Bureau on 12th August 2013.� They may not have
articulated them directly there and they may have been as vague with the
adviser there as they tried to be with me in looking back at matters.� The Citizens
Advice Bureau did not provide them with any satisfactory answer, but they were
resistant to going to social services because they did not want to risk A being
taken from her mother.� 

61.             
I think that the father did
discuss the bruising he had seen with them either on the Wednesday or on the
Thursday, that is 14th or 15th August.� They could and
should, it seems to me, have been aware of it in any event from the Wednesday
or the Thursday from their own direct observations.� I consider it highly
likely that the maternal grandmother�s contributions to the history to Dr Y
and to F represents their state of mind that week and it is appropriate to read
in, in looking back at this the actual record from the hospital which was
provided to me on the first day of the hearing.� This is what is recorded:

�MGM and MGF have grave concerns about Z.� Z and M
have been together less than three months.� MGM says Z is very controlling of M.�
He won�t allow MGM to visit M unannounced.� He won�t let M walk to MGM�s in
case she meets any men along the way.� He claims that A is ratty whenever she
returns from her father�s address.� MGM has reason to believe that M has rent
arrears of approximately �800.� She believes that Z is encouraging M to launder
money.� She and MGF approached the Citizens Advice Bureau this week to find out
where they stand legally vis-�-vis A.� MGF urged her to contact children�s
social care earlier and she wishes she had done now.� She says she challenged M
about some bruising behind A�s ear recently, but M had claimed ignorance and
she hadn�t wanted to assume the worst about her daughter.�

62.             
It rather looks from that that at
that point in time MGF and MGM were only very shortly behind the father in
wanting to act protectively.� It is extremely concerning, therefore, that from
that point their attitude seems to have changed.� During the assessment of them
and in their statements, there is a sense that they have not taken on board the
significance of eleven separate bruises to an 8-month-old child, but rather
that they were beguiled by the fact that such injuries were not medically
serious.� There also creeps into their assessment a sense of resentment on
their part of the father for initiating the protective intervention.� That
resentment or annoyance is evident in the statement of the maternal grandmother
in which she considers that his actions are borne of a jealous fall out (see
paragraph 20 at C111).� This was also evident to Claire Peace, the social worker,
when she assessed the maternal grandparents.� It seems to me that by the autumn
neither appeared to be willing to contemplate the possibility that the mother
or Z were the perpetrator of injuries and that seems to me to remain their
perspective.� 

63.             
Initially, as I have said, they
appear not to have had any knowledge of who had care of A during the morning of
Tuesday, 13th August.� I consider it highly likely that the account
they offered to the solicitor from Lancashire County Council when she
telephoned them from this court on 7th January that they had spent
more of the morning of 13th August at the mother�s home with Z was a
made up account at the request of either the mother or Z.� That request was
only shortly made before the telephone call from court, but I cannot tell
whether it was made hours or days before.� 

64.             
I reject the maternal
grandmother�s account that she overheard the mother and Z talking on the
telephone about a Tuesday and jumped to the conclusion not only that they were
talking about Tuesday, 13th August, but also that she had been
present with Z at the mother�s home on the 13th August or at all.�
It seems to me highly unlikely in the wake of Z�s request that the grandparents
should ask before they visited. that they would have just turned up,
particularly at the early hour initially claimed, even were they in the area to
go to the Post Office.� It also seems to me highly unlikely that they would
then have chosen to spend the whole morning with him given their opinion of him
at that point.� Quite apart from this, the accounts each protagonist has given
of this morning are at variance, which to my mind demonstrates how last minute
the concocted accounts were.

65.             
The maternal grandparents
recognised during the hearing before me the significance of the contradiction
in the accounts and decided to withdraw theirs altogether.� They were never
able satisfactorily to explain why they had given such a palpably false account
in the first place or really to explain satisfactorily their abandonment of it
so soon after it had been offered.� Their attitude to A�s injuries, to the
consequent intervention and to the father, in conjunction with their
willingness to lie and risk an outcome for A which might mean that she would
return to danger, demonstrates to me that their present mind-set prevents them
from having much capacity to protect A from similar abuse to that which
precipitated the intervention of the Local Authority and these proceedings.� It
also means, very sadly indeed, that the Local Authority or indeed the father
would be entitled to be very cautious about trusting them to act protectively
in the future. 

66.             
I turn to the mother.� It should
be obvious by now that I have narrowed the pool of possible perpetrators to
two, namely, either the mother or Z.� I think it likely that there is only one
perpetrator and that most of the bruising which was seen by the father on
Tuesday, 13th August was inflicted in the period between A�s
photographed bath on the Sunday evening and her being handed over to father on
the Tuesday at about 1:00pm to 1:30pm.� I consider that it would be dangerous
to attempt to narrow down the window further than that.� My preference would
be, if at all possible, to be able to say who is the more likely perpetrator,
but if I cannot I should not attempt to do so on either an instinctive or speculative
basis.� Such a conclusion must be based on the evidence and the facts I can
properly find.� 

67.             
If the mother did not cause the
injuries to A herself, she is responsible for a failure to protect her of a
significant magnitude and, in any event, there are many concerns about the
broad canvass for these events and the mother�s parenting.� Those concerns are
these.� The mother seems on her own admission at a time when A was only weeks
old and a tiny dependent infant to have commenced a lifestyle which I have
characterised as degraded and degrading.� Miss Bowcock in cross-examination was
kinder and referred to the mother as �walking on the wild side.�� This involved
heavy drinking at least two nights a week; staying out very late;
embarking on an affair with Z, on his own unchallenged account when A was only
2 months old; and dangerous sexual encounters with at least one other person,
as demonstrated by her text messages.� The mother attributes the breakdown of
her marriage to the fact that the father seemed to pay more attention and give
more affection to A than her.� This seems to me to be a most unusual complaint
by a new mother.� The mother was thought by the father to be unhappy.� He urged
her to seek help.� She has sought to distance herself from his point of view,
but it seems plain to me that something was going wrong for her at that time,
although she has not been frank enough for me to fathom what it can have been.�


68.             
The mother delegated rather a lot
of A�s care to other people.� As I have outlined, by the time of the injuries
her care for her was no more than two and a half nights a week on average.� The
mother was spending a great deal more money than she was receiving.� She was in
debt, including considerable rent arrears, and that is likely to have been a
significant stressor which was sending her to paid employment. This was notwithstanding
the fact that she was on benefits and on maternity pay.� Furthermore, the
mother�s attitude to the bruises that prompted these proceedings has been very
far from protective.� In the first place, she has not chosen to assist the
professionals or this court with any attempt to give a frank and accurate
account of events.� Her approach seems to have been one of saying the thing
which is least damaging to her own image and cause.� At one point she was open
about this, which demonstrates to me that this mother does not understand the
value of telling the truth either for herself or for her daughter.� 

69.             
I think it likely that she has
attempted to delete any damaging messaging from her telephone before it was
scrutinised and that that accounts for the fact that there are no WhatsApp
messages at all on it for the relevant period.� It is plain that she had used
WhatsApp quite frequently both before and after this.� It is notable that the
father had used WhatsApp to message her about the bruises on 13th
August.� It is fortunate for A that the mother was either not able or forgot to
delete those text messages from the morning of 13th August,
establishing, it seems to me, very clearly that she left Z caring for A during
that whole morning, despite the fact that he was ill and despite the fact that
she would have known that neither A�s father nor her own parents would have
approved of such a delegation of her care.� 

70.             
Her attitude, like Z�s and, sadly,
that of her parents, seems to be that the father should not have alerted the
authorities to these injuries.� She seems to see the protection and the
intervention as the harm and not the injuries and their significance . That comes
over rather loud and clear in a Facebook message conversation between her and a
friend called Laura.� In that conversation the father is referred to, I think
by Laura, in fairness, as �a twat� and the significance of the injuries is
repeatedly minimised with them being referred to as �a bruise� and the fact of
the investigation characterised as �ridiculous�.� It is interesting to note
that the mother in that exchange refers to Z being brought into the proceedings
even though, as she purports to say, he only saw A when she, the mother, was
there.� Plainly, she had rationed the truth as much from her friends and
supporters as from the professionals and the court.� 

71.             
I also consider it likely that the
mother is at the heart of the doomed attempt to minimise the discovery that Z
was looking after A on his own on 13th August by getting her parents
to offer a false account that they were there too.� Since no one is prepared to
break the silence as to how this occurred, I cannot tell who took what role in
that attempt to divert the court from examining what really happened to A that
week.� Whether the mother is a leader or a follower in this, it is a stark
example of a complete failure to engage with the court or with the social
workers and, therefore, with the protection of her own daughter.� This
continues into the failure to alert the Local Authority, the children�s
guardian or the court about the incident on 13th February or
the �you�re going down� text on 26th March. It further continues
into her failure to disclose the reconciliations of the first weekend of this
hearing, including discussion about the evidence when she was in the witness
box.� 

72.             
I turn to Z.� Z is also a
concerning figure.� At the time these injuries were inflicted the following
facts applied to him.� He was ill on the morning on 13th August.�
His relationship with the mother was new and he can be shown by his texts and
by the observation of the grandparents to have been both controlling and
insecure in that relationship.� I consider it highly significant that he asked
her questions about what was left over in the freezer and, indeed, that he had
looked at her phone and even much later in the proceedings sent texts
pretending to be her.� He had taken it upon himself to seek to make the mother
regularise the father�s contact.� He had taken it upon himself to close the
open access her parents had previously enjoyed to her house and their
grandaughter.� He plainly felt a degree of malice to the father, as shown by
the text on 13th August, although I cannot fathom what he thought
the father had done to him.� It does not seem to have occurred to him that the
father was in fact the victim of his adulterous and deceptive relationship with
the father�s wife.� 

73.             
He has demonstrated a capacity for
violence with his convictions for common assault and the incident on 13th
February.� His demeanour is a very odd combination of someone who is both
highly anxious, but he is also arrogantly confident that his own ability to talk
over or through any obvious weaknesses in his own arguments will hold sway.�
During the months of the proceedings, he has been unstinting in his efforts to
persuade people, including the police and social services, that the father
should be viewed suspiciously and unstinting in his efforts to distance himself
as far as possible from any suspicion or involvement.� This emerges in his
police interview, the assessment session with the social worker and in his oral
evidence.� It seems to me overwhelmingly likely that this has also been his
approach in conversations with the family about the issues in the case and in
persuading them to his approach he seems to me to have been very successful.� 

74.             
This may be simply because he
perceives that a stepfather figure is rather an easy scapegoat and he has felt
the need to come out fighting against that assumption using all the means at
his disposal.� I do consider that he, like the mother, has played a major role in
the attempt to divert the court from the obvious inferences of the texts of 13th
August 2013, which demonstrate beyond peradventure that he had charge of A
during at least three hours that morning.� I consider it highly likely
that he was part of the agreement that the grandparents would give a false
account of having been present with him.� As I have already said, the stand-off
between the witnesses means that I can do no more than guess who led this
conspiracy and guessing is not a proper basis for a judge to make findings of
fact.� 

75.             
Once again, I cannot say who had
the larger role in the conspiracy, him or the mother, and that leaves me
without any ability to draw inferences from it as to which one of them
inflicted injury to A.� The mother has always been observed to be gentle and
affectionate with A.� Her health visitor was shocked when alerted to the
injuries.� The mother is obviously very proud of A and her �phone is full of
photographs of the baby that show this.� Until the evidence was heard, the
father did not consider that the mother was a likely perpetrator of injuries
and he, of the credible witnesses, knows her best of those that I heard.� His
counsel�s submissions are now that I do not have the evidence upon which to
base a conclusion as to the identity of the perpetrator as between the mother
and Z.� That is also the position of the Local Authority and the children�s
guardian, although no one sought to persuade me during the extremely helpful
submissions that all the advocates made that I should not do so if I thought it
right to do so.� 

76.             
I was ready to attempt to deliver
an extempore judgment in this matter on Friday, having been greatly helped by
those submissions.� I was, however, troubled that I should leave no stone
unturned in seeking to identify a perpetrator as between the mother and Z and I
have spent some considerable time re-reading the evidence, my notes of the oral
evidence with that purpose. I have, sadly, come to the conclusion that I cannot
do so.� I would have far preferred to deliver a judgment that tells A
ultimately that her mother was not her assailant, even though responsible for
serious deficiencies in protecting her.� I cannot do so because it would not be
based upon the evidence, but on that preference and my distaste for Z�s
approach to giving evidence.� Those factors are not enough.� 

77.             
The four family members, by whom I
mean the mother, Z and the maternal grandparents, have deliberately, it
seems to me, withheld the whole picture and diverted my process.� This means I
simply cannot say as between M and Z which of them injured A, but I am quite
satisfied that it was one of them.� If it were not the mother, then she is
responsible for a serious failure to protect.� If it is not Z, his part in the
orchestration of the family�s sympathies against the father and his part in the
conspiracy to offer false accounts also represents a culpable failure to
protect A in the future on this part.� 

78.             
So far as the future is concerned,
it now seems to me blindingly obvious that A should live with her father.� He
will need a great deal of support, which he cannot now source from the maternal
family in the wake of my findings.� 

[Judgment ends]

HHJ Corbett: Judgment 19.3.14

 I have conducted a Fact Finding and Threshold Criteria Split hearing. The welfare hearing was originally listed also during this week but the Local Authority (LA) sought to adjourn that due to not having finalised its care plans, they having decided (pre fact finding) that the children could not be returned to the parents' care but not having finalised their alternative plans. I agreed and retained the listing for fact finding and Threshold Criteria hearing. The welfare hearing has been listed for 16th June time estimate 5 days.

 

I am asked by the LA to find as facts matters 2-12 on the composite schedule at A51-56, namely allegations of physical abuse by the mother and/or father against the 2 children L and J and an additional matter pleaded in the draft Threshold ie "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals". The parents submit that upon analysis of the evidence none of the findings should be made. The Children's Guardian has played a full part in the hearing and through counsel has drawn the court's attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence. 

 

I have been greatly assisted by all 4 Counsel during the hearing and by their detailed submissions. 

 

THE LAW

 

The LA has the burden of proving the facts it seeks and of proving that the Threshold Criteria are met. These issues fall to be resolved on the balance of probabilities. The law is clear and the Court follows the guidance given by the House of Lords in Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35: 
"The law operates a binary system in which the only values are 0 and 1. The fact either happened or it did not. If the tribunal is left in doubt, the doubt is resolved by a rule that one party or the other carries the burden of proof. If the party who bears the burden of proof fails to discharge it, a value of 0 is returned and the fact is treated as not having happened. If he does discharge it, a value of 1 is returned and the fact is treated as having happened." (Lord Hoffman, para.2) 

Baroness Hale said (para.32):
"In our legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue: the party with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied him that it did. But generally speaking a judge is able to make up his mind where the truth lies without needing to rely upon the burden of proof".

If the LA cannot establish the facts to the required standard, they are to be treated as not having taken place. The LA therefore bears the burden of establishing that the parents acted towards the children in the ways that are detailed in the said Scott Schedule. There is no burden on the parents to establish that they did not so act. They are also not required to provide any satisfactory or benign explanation as to why L and J have made statements about their conduct towards them (Re M (Fact Finding Hearing: Burden of Proof) [2013] 2 FLR 874)

BACKGROUND

This is the second set of proceedings involving the parents MB and KR (the parents). The first concerned P, K, L and J and ended after 13 months of proceedings on 12.9.13 when DJ (MC) Arbuthnot made a Supervision Order to the LA. The 2 elder children P and K were to live with their father Mr H.  J and L had been returned to their parents' home on 11.8.13 along with baby KR who was born during those proceedings on 27.5.13 and had remained living with the parents. The Threshold was agreed by the parties to those proceedings on 12.9.13. 

 

On 19.9.13 all 3 children (L, J and baby KR) were removed from the parents' care following an allegation made by J that day at school. The 3 children have been placed separately since 19.9.13 except that since 21.2.14 L moved to join J with maternal aunt MR. 

 

WITNESSES

The hearing lasted for 5 days and evidence was heard  from the following witnesses:             

 

      a) Dr. H Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist
      b) CB and GE, the Allocated Social Workers
 c) MR, Maternal Aunt presently caring for L and J
      d) Ms. CT, Independent Social Worker
      e) The Nursery/School staff Ms S, Ms W, Ms C 
      f)  L's foster carer, HM
	 g) Both Police Officers who attended at the school, DC K and DC B who conducted the ABE interview of  L
      h) The Parents MB and KR

CHRONOLOGY

I set out below a detailed history of the relevant events with my observations as to the strength of the evidence and/or my analysis. (references to "children" should be taken to mean L and J unless indicated otherwise). I do not propose to set out each witness's evidence; I will refer to relevant evidence in the chronology and analysis. I have of course read the entire trial bundle and additional documents prepared and watched L's Achieving Best Evidence interview (ABE) 4 times. 

 

Until 28.8.12 L and J had always been in the care of their mother; they were then 3.9y and 2.2y respectively. On that date she assaulted P in their presence, while drunk. Following her arrest the mother agreed to the children being accommodated. L and P were placed together with the mother's sister MP, J with her sister MR. The LA unsurprisingly commenced care proceedings. 

 

Dr H said that such an event would be well remembered by the children. MR told the court that P discussed the incident with her siblings.

This assault was likely to have been a significant memory for L and J, not least because it marked the beginning of their separation from their parents' care until August 2013.

The parents are a couple; the father formally lives in his mother's home in Battersea and the mother in the LA. The father stays with the mother the majority of time. 

On 24.12.12 P assaulted her maternal aunt MP, witnessed by L. Dr H again agreed this was likely to have been a significant memory for L.

 

On 27.5.13 baby KR was born and remained in the care of his mother. 

 

On 10.6.13 J approached Ms A a Speech and Language Therapist (SALT) visiting his nursery; she was not his treating SALT. He told her "mummy pushed and hurt me here" and pointed to his right eyebrow; he said and did this twice. She could not see a mark on J. One of the 2 allocated Social Workers, GE, accepted in evidence that this incident could not have happened as described; the mother was not having unsupervised contact with J in this period. The LA does not seek to prove this but it is a relevant complaint as part of the chronology. It is the first time that either child made any complaint against either parent. 

 

On 10.7.13 GE spoke to J, he said in evidence that he decided not to ask J directly about what he had said on 10.6.13 because he doubted his ability to recall from a month earlier. J told GE that he was happy at home.

 

On 22/23.7.13 it was noted that J had an injury to his upper lip/nose area. He gave a variety of explanations; to MR he attributed it to L, to his mother he blamed MRs' children and also said that all 3 of his cousins has caused it. He said "they beat me up and I beat them all up".

 

On 2.7.13 the rehabilitation plan began to the parents. The first unsupervised visit for L and J with their mother was 2.7.13. Before the children moved home full time on 11.8.13 some work was done with them about the move home which focused on practicalities. I accept MRs' evidence that she was not given any guidance about how to assist J emotionally during this period. The other allocated Social Worker CB was unable to give any evidence as to what, if any, advice the LA gave to either child's carer. I deal with this below at paragraph 73.

 

On 11.8.13 L and J moved back to the mother's care full time. 

 

 Between 11.8.13-19.9.13 the family was visited regularly by Social Workers, Family Support Worker, Health Visitor, J was taken to SALT (the mother missed his first appointment but kept subsequent ones), baby KR was taken to appointments including medical and L and J attended school/nursery from the beginning of term, J starting a few days into the term due to a staggered intake.

 

There was nothing complained of by the children during these 5 weeks. There was no evidence of physical harm noted. 

On 12.9.13 a 12 months Supervision Order was made by DJ (MC) Arbuthnot.  P and K by agreement were to live with their father Mr H, with contact to their mother. The LA arrived at court with a document headed "Schedule of Requirements" which they wished the parents to sign.  This may have been sent via the legal department the day before, but the parents had not seen the list of requirements until the hearing day. There was discussion about this all day at court. 

 

The parents were willing to sign an amended document called a "Working Agreement" which differed in a few ways. I set these out later at paragraphs 82-83.

 

Despite the fact that the LA original document was not signed at court the District Judge was presented with an agreed position that the children remain in the care of their parents, the father agreed to a Supervision  Order, mother's counsel made brief submissions that one was not required and the District Judge made a Supervision Order. All parties on 12.9.13 must have been of the view that the 3 children's welfare was best met in the care of their mother and father. 

 

On 19.9.13 J made comments to his nursery teacher Ms C. Her note reads:

 

"I was telling T�. who had hurt someone that I didn't like hitting. J was standing nearby. J said "I don't like punching" I said "I wonder who punches you" J said "my daddy do punch me" He continued playing then said "my mummy make me cry". I said I wonder why she makes you cry" J answered "hurt me and smack me and punch me"

I note that the teacher asked "I wonder who punches you" which invites J to suggest someone's name and introduces the idea of "you" ie J being pushed. J himself had not suggested to his teacher that he was the victim of being punched until she suggested it to him. This is an early example of J diverting adult attention to himself. 

The school contacted Social Services who called the police. I fully understand why the school took that action, but it appears to me that the Social Workers should have taken time to consider what J said to his teacher in the light of his obvious untruth to the SALT on 10.6.13. The Social Work team did not seek to ask question the illogicality of J saying on 10.6.13 that his mother with whom he had had only supervised contact for 10 months could have injured him on the eyebrow, where in fact there was no visible injury. It was only at the end of day 5 of the hearing, when all of the evidence had been heard and in answer to my question about the schedule that Counsel for the LA confirmed that they did not seek to prove the allegation on 10.6.13. Further the Social Work team knew that J had given varying accounts of the injury to his upper lip on 22/23 July 2013. They were aware by 19.9.13 that J was known to have made false statements.

 

At the end of the school day on 19.9.13 J and L remained in the room shared by the Nursery and Reception class, which had a pull across divider/partition. They spent a number of hours playing in this room according to the Headteacher Ms S. 

 

In my judgment J had the opportunity during these hours to repeat to L what he had said to Ms C. 

At 16.50h CB  and Ms W the Asst Headteacher spoke to J. CB produced in evidence a note written by her the next day at 8.26am. CB could identify only 3 of the words J said, "L" "Mummy" and "Punch". CB was not certain which way round the words were said. Ms W believed that J said "L punch Mummy" and according to DC B Ms W was sure at the time on 19.9.13 that the words were said that way round. 

It is common ground that J had unclear speech that was quite difficult at times to understand.

Where was L during the conversation with J?  The Nursery and Reception classes had one large room with floor to ceiling pull across partition/divider. J was in the Nursery side of the room. L was playing on the computer on the Reception side of the room, near to the divider. CB was unclear whether the divider was closed, Ms W said L was on other side of the divider.  Ms C said it is likely that she left the partition open. Ms S was in and out of the room a few times and clearly remembered L in the same room as J, she indicated a distance about 4-5 metres apart. I cannot come to any firm conclusion as to whether the divider was open or closed given these varying accounts � but I can be sure that L was playing on a computer in the Reception end of the room, a few metres away from the conversation with J and there were no other children around apart from J. Even if the divider was fully or partly drawn, L was sitting at a computer near to the divider in a quiet room. L could well have heard the discussion between her brother and CB and DC B. She would have known that to stay behind at school in this way with adults talking to J was unusual. 

 

Later DC B and CB spoke with L. There is no contemporaneous note of this "interview" � which is the word used to describe it by CB in her file note. This is poor practice by them both as professionals having discussions/interviews with a 4 year old. CB's file note says that she did not take a note as DC K was doing so. DC K has confirmed that she was not taking a note and was sitting some 8 metres away. 

 

CB notes that the police asked L  directly if anyone hurt her at home, she initially said J but then went on to say clearly that mummy had punched her and when asked where she advised it was in the stomach and demonstrated this by punching her own stomach with a closed fist, she made reference to smacking. When asked if she wanted to go home L said no but CB did not know if this was because she was having a great deal of fun on the computer.

 

DC B told the court that J was playing on the other side of the room about 5 metres away while she was speaking with L.

 

CB did not note or recall any complaint by L against her father. DC B has no recollection of such a complaint. DC K completed a CRIS report at 19.56h referring to a conversation between DC B, CB and L "L also disclosed to DC B that dad slaps her but it is unknown were [sic]"

 

DC B agreed in evidence that when she was summarising the conversation to DC K she would also have been discussing the earlier allegations made by J when deciding whether to exercise police powers of protection. 

 

The only reference to L making an allegation against her father is a note made by DC K who did not hear the relevant conversation. Those who did speak with L were involved in safeguarding and it is highly unlikely that the Social Worker would have failed to note or recall such a complaint by L about her father. 

 

I find that it is unlikely that L made any allegation against her father in this discussion with CB and DC B.

 

The lack of any contemporaneous note, the fact that somehow DC K has introduced the idea of a complaint against the father in her CRIS report which even CB does not note, the blunt question by DC B asking if anyone hits her at home, and the evidence that L is happily engaged at the computer, all leads me to have real concerns about what L is alleging, if anything.

 

The children would have known something significant was happening when they said goodbye to their parents and went off to stay elsewhere. I agree with the submission by Counsel for the father that the children are likely to have realised that complaints of physical abuse attract adult attention.

 

The police took the 2 children, plus baby KR who had come to school with the mother, into police protection. The parents were allowed to say goodbye. The police and school staff all described the parents as cooperative and appropriate at school that evening, particularly given the circumstances. 

 

All 3 children were separated in placements. The parents have had only supervised contact since then, 6 months ago.

 

Later that evening L stated that she did not want to be cared for by her aunt MPand that her aunt had hit her. L subsequently informed her aunt MR that aunt MP had not hit her. The LA view is that there is no truth in what L alleges against MP. L went to an emergency foster placement that night and to a different foster carer MH the next day, where she remained until 21.2.14 when she moved to her aunt MRs' home following L's allegations of harm by MH.

 

J was placed with MR on 19.9.13. On that day J told her 10 year old son that his "mummy burned me daddy punched L in the belly and my mummy and daddy slapped K in the mouth".  It is a fact that no burn was noted at the Child Protection medical or otherwise. It appears therefore that J was saying something clearly untrue.

 

On 20.9.13 DC B carried out an ABE interview of  L. I have watched this several times. I have no hesitation in concluding that this was a difficult interview to conduct due to L being very unsettled, but equally that this is a flawed interview. The LA relies upon this interview and asserts that L's statements are reliable.

 

There are deficiencies in the interview process, which are highlighted by ISW, Ms CT on both her reports. DC B largely accepted these in her evidence. Dr H agreed there were deficiencies.

The deficiencies include the following:
a.	adult language was used by the officer e.g. audio, cassette tapes � with no explanation to ensure that she understood;
b.	early in the interview DC B referred L back to their conversation of the previous evening rather than allowing the interview to progress more freely. The officer did not accept this criticism in cross examination and said that L was already aware of why she was being interviewed. In circumstances where the DC had not made a note of the discussion the evening before this is an even more concerning technique. 
c.	L was not asked what made her happy before what made her sad. There was no attempt to introduce any balance. 
d.	L substitutes 'P' for 'Mummy; this is not properly clarified and nor is the context; The mention of P hurting her was not explored at all, just ignored, in contrast to remarks about her mother which were followed up, indicating that the officer was more interested in mummy than other names.
e.	The misleading impression is given to L that some things are believed and others are not without the statements being given the same inference and weight;
f.	L was distracted, active and difficult to interview.
g.	Constant leading questions were used and there was reinforcement of negative responses in relation to Mummy;
h.	No clarification of context, time place, who present or the use of the certain crucial words e.g. 'hit' 'flip' and 'flick'. No exploration of what hit flick etc meant.
i.	Clear lack of open-ended questions;
j.	Clear examples of the child being rewarded for answers perceived as 'positive' by the interviewer with specific inducements including playing with toys when she is clearly bored of being interviewed;
k.	Significant inconsistencies that were not explored � e.g. 'Mummy is a he'; the comment that 'M' the 'baby' had punched her. It turned out that M had in fact merely made baby KR cry, and had not punched at all. This would have been an excellent opportunity for the officer to try to find out what L meant by punch.
l.	Significant levels of miscommunications, which were not clarified;
m.	There was no social worker present 
n.	It is significant that L emphatically stated that she liked living at home with no indication of fear

On 20.9.13 Child Protection medicals were carried out on both children by a doctor who had been given detail of what had been alleged. No unexplained injuries were noted, the children's presentation was entirely normal, baby KR was said to be thriving. L is noted to be well looked after and thriving, presenting as sociable cheerful and chatty. J was also in good health, well presented and chatty. 

 

On 25.9.13 CB's statement gives an account that GE visited the children at school and that L appeared relaxed after she was told by GE in answer to her question "you watch me" that she would be watched . GEs' file note placed a different slant on this, it quite clearly sets out how the children say they want to see their mother and L misses her, and that her mummy makes her happy, and L said "you watch me" and GE said a nice lady would [watch her] . There is no reference at all in GEs' note to L's face and body language appearing relaxed after hearing she would be watched. L spoke very positively about her mother, not at all apprehensive about seeing her, despite what CB says (who was not present). J told GE that all his friends hit him and make him sad, but then went happily to sit down and play with another boy. CB's statement does not accurately reflect GEs' own file note and gives a misleading impression that L is seeking reassurance that there will be supervision. I also note that L  is a child who knows that she has been "watched" for a year in contact, so someone watching would not be unusual for her.

 

L's foster carer MH says that on 1.10.13 L, whilst saying she wants to see her mum said "sometime my mum beat me and then my kidney hurt". The foster carer reported this to the LA the next day. A note has not been produced by her despite the fact she said she kept a diary. It is not suggested that L knew what a kidney is or where it is.

 

On 4.10.13 at contact J made a statement that his teacher cut his nose with a knife. His teacher denies this and the allegation appears untrue, but it is noteworthy that he said it. 

 

On 7.10.13 J made statements to MR. He denied being burnt or hurt by his mother, and said "mummy never hit the baby". When asked if she did burn him he did not respond. When asked a leading question if she had burned or hurt him he said yes. (this is a very interesting piece of evidence and it seems to me that if asked questions in a certain way J confirms, even though he had retracted what he said. There is no evidence that J was ever burnt by anyone)

 

On 11.10.13 J said that his escort had hit him and swung him around. This seems unlikely. J said this to MR after she asked why he had been hitting the escort himself, again it appears the allegation may have been made to deflect attention from him own actions. 

 

On 16.10.13 MR said that J was crying saying K, her son, hit him. MR told the court she was sure that this could not have been true as K was downstairs and she would have seen him go past her. This shows J is capable of telling untruths, and with emotional distress accompanying.

 

Also that same day a one year old child R accidentally caught J in the face causing a small scratch above the nose. J told MR that R had punched him in the face. This raises a question for me as to whether J knows what "punch" means? And/or whether he deliberately told another untruth.

 

On 16th and 11th October J volunteered to MR that his mother did not hurt or burn him. 

 

On 6.11.13 Ms C says that J made a statement that day in circle time. The class were taking turns to say "I don't like�" Some other children said "I don't like hitting/punching", J said "My mum just hit me on the leg", and went on to say his mum flicked him, hit him in the belly, and punched L in belly and mum smacked him in the belly and face. No contemporaneous note was produced by Ms C. She rang GE 2 weeks later on 20.11.13; he does not recall her referring to a note. If one existed I am surprised that she did not send it to GE. A school safeguarding form completed by Ms S on 21.11.13 differs from the email sent to GE on 20.11.13 as to the latter part. It seems likely that on 20.11.13 Ms C was trying to recall what was said by J on 6.11.13. When reading her 20.11.13 note it appears that J having got the class' attention adds something extra with each successive sentence. 

 

Later that day in contact the contact records that J alleges his mother hurt him when she carefully pushed his chair under the table. The note puts the word carefully in bold. This is another example of J making an allegation which is demonstrably untrue.

 

On 21.11.13 again in front of whole class J said "I am sad when mum hits me in the face and dad punches L in the belly. But not C he don't do nothing". GE visited J that day. J said he felt happy when baby KR cuddles him and "then my dad punches me in the belly". It is odd that J describes himself as happy then discloses physical abuse. J expressed his clear wish to see his parents and go home. 

 

On 26.11.13 J was taken to see the Asst Head Ms W due to bad behaviour. He said he wanted to talk about that incident later and instead he wanted to talk about his parents then proceeded to say his parents hit him all the time.  J seems to understand that his comments attract attention and that he is trying to deflect attention away from his own behaviour.

 

On 28.11.13 J said to his teacher in front of other children that he had a gun at his house, following his saying that he loves his parents. His final remark was "that's all I wanted to say" again indicating an attention seeking performance. 

 

On 30.1.14 J said his parents poked him in the eye. It is inherently unlikely that both parents did that, and I note that the consequences of eye poking were not detected on J. 

 

On 1.2.14 MR noted some of  L's hair was missing. L said MH had cut it because it was dirty. On 20.2.14 L repeated to MR that MH had cut her hair with scissors because it was dirty, and said that MH had lied to the GP the day before when she informed him that the hair came out because her mum braided it too tight. The foster carer says that the hair was braided too tightly. The GP note adds nothing evidentially to this. 

 

On 21.2.14, after a visit to MR, L got upset when told she was going back to MH, and said MH twisted her arm, MR demonstrated when giving evidence what L had shown her.

 

The Social Workers met L at the contact centre. L said she had been with MH to the GP, and then went on to say she went to the dentist. L alleged that MH twisted her hand so much, she slapped her, she always makes her cry, and she slapped her so hard. Then when asked L said she had been slapped once by MH. She elaborated upon this by saying that she had been taken to the dentist, got a sticker and pointed to a gap in her teeth. MH says L did not go to the dentist but to the GP. The LA investigated and concluded that these allegations are unsubstantiated. It is not my role in this hearing to determine if the foster carer hurt L. I can note is that the foster carer said that she has experienced L lying to her and maintaining the lies even though the truth can be seen. I can also note that the LA relies on the truth of what L says about her parents, but not about her complaints relating to her foster carer. 

 

MR looked after J from August 2012 to August 2013 then since 19.9.13. She says in her statement that as time has gone on she has found that J will tell lies and can make things up as he goes along especially when he feels he has an audience. She told the court it can be difficult to know when he is lying; sometime he smirks sometimes not, and may say outlandish things like "my daddy eats doors". 

 

DISCUSSION

Ms CT an Independent Social Worker (ISW) was involved in the previous proceedings and re-instructed in these. She has over 30 years' experience in child protection. She had said in her reports that she recommended a veracity expert be instructed. I had ruled that one was not needed. I refused an application by the mother to instruct a child psychiatrist to advise as to veracity. In fact Ms CT said in evidence that she did not recommend such a psychiatrist but an ISW expert in interpreting ABE interviews. Does the fact she made this recommendation detract from her evidence? I did not think so, and found her fair compelling and helpful. She sets out her considerable concern about the ABE process in her report, with which I agree. She told the court that upon watching the ABE she sensed no distress or anxiety from L. I agree with her completely. 

 

Her professional view, which I accept, is that the mother has undergone a major change since the commencement of the earlier proceedings in August 2012 and that she felt she would know if the mother was lying to her. 

I agree with her that it is troubling that the children have actually made complaints of physical harm. Her professional view is that they cannot be perceived as truthful in origin.

Ms CT told the court that she felt the children had been removed prematurely when L and J had only been home a few weeks and had not been given an opportunity to settle. 

In evidence she gave a great deal of consideration to the possibility put to her that the children have a memory of the assault on P, and by P on her aunt MP.

Dr H, Child Psychiatrist also reported in the previous proceedings. She found L's accounts in interview credible on the subject of her being hurt by her mother. Dr H has not been trained on ABE interview techniques since the 1980s and has not re-read the guidelines recently. She placed reliance upon on the emotional presentation of the children. This was not noted by me when I watched ABE of  L, and as set out earlier, there is clear evidence from MR of J crying when alleging assault by K which was clearly untrue. 

 

In her own interview with L Dr H asked her what happens if she is naughty. When L said "nothing" Dr H said that sometimes when people are angry they shouted or smacked. Then L said "she shouted and she slapped". At paragraph 95 of her report Dr H skims over this exchange and her role in it by saying, baldly, "L told me her mother shouted and slapped".

I was very concerned to read these parts of the report. Dr H had not accept L saying "nothing" in response to her question and Dr H herself suggested shouting or smacking. Dr H herself agreed in evidence that this was not the ideal way of getting information from L. It gave me real concerns about the way Dr H had approached her instruction. 

However, by the end of her oral evidence she appeared to be saying that: the children have experienced physical harm, the degree extent and timing is hard to determine, and it is heightened by their experience of the assault by the mother on P, and P on MP�.it is likely the children experienced some treatment they don't like�..I don't see L as being deliberately untruthful but I accept a degree of confusion and a degree of emotion as to P�..What I am not sure of is how much of it was new behaviour in the 5 weeks at home, I suspect the mother was attempting to manage L's challenging behaviour�..I can see the deficiencies of the ABE interview�.I find it difficult that a child makes allegations against a parent when they want to be with that parent without there being truth in it�..I feel convinced that there's no reason L and J made a series of allegations if the period home had not been aversive [sic]�..Children who are not verbal do have powerful memories (when  asked if they could remember pre August 2012).

 

The LA relies on Dr H to support their contention that the court should make the findings. Dr H conceded that the ABE interview had deficiencies, she herself conducted quite leading examination of L, she agreed that it was not possible to separate the children recounting from their own experience from what had happened to P and that even though that was back in August 2012 children do have powerful memories. 

 

The more I heard from Dr H the more I felt her oral evidence had moved significantly away from her written reports.  

 

No complaint was ever made by the children to the Children's Guardian who has seen them in a variety of settings in both proceedings.

 

The parents each gave clear and measured evidence. They are clearly bewildered and frustrated by this second process. I gained the clear view that the mother lives daily with the consequences for her family of her assault on P. They both appeared uncomprehending of why the children have said what they have. They deny any assault on either of L or J. I did not get the impression that either was covering up for the other. They were cross examined by Counsel for the LA about the allegations. I was impressed by the mother's quiet dignity in such trying circumstances as this case, which she knows began with her originally. I found each of them quite credible witnesses.

 

The children's various statements lack any context as to time, date and surrounding circumstances. They are never asked by the adults, tell me more, or are you sure, who else was there, who saw this. The allegations against the parents appear to have been accepted by the LA at face value, unlike the allegations made about others eg MH.

 

There is no medical evidence to corroborate the allegations of ill treatment. To the contrary the Child Protection medical notes they are well cared for. 

 

The parents had worked hard to achieve the children's return home in August 2013, after a year's separation. The mother had a criminal conviction relating to her assault on another child. The parents were under scrutiny from a variety of professionals from 11.8.13 to 19.9.13, with a 12 months Supervision Order, Social Work visits at least once a week, Family Support Worker, school, SALT attendance, GP attendance, probation and the mother having had a suspended sentence of imprisonment. There is no evidence of their inability to control the children's behaviour appropriately. It is inherently unlikely that the parents having been closely observed in supervised contact for a year would during the 5 week period which they describe as "joyous" beat, hit, punch and flick their 2 children, 2 children in relation to whom there had never been a previous allegation of abuse. The contact notes refer to appropriate and happy times spent in supervised contact, and no allegation was ever made by either child against the father during his unsupervised contact times.

 

The mother was engaged with the programme of work set out by the LA. During this 5 week period there was no concern raised by any professional about the care the children were receiving, the school felt the children settled well, and that she engaged well with the school, and the children's behaviour was not of any concern. 

 

The first complaint made by J on 12.6.13 was clearly false. A momentum seems to have built since then. The professionals who knew J from nursery school agreed he had SALT difficulties. 

 

Both children have made some demonstrably untrue assertions. Those who have provided care for L have known her to make false assertions, MR and MH. Both children have enjoyed the attention their remarks have brought. Both children refer to hitting their parents back which leads one to imagine that they are "fighting" in play rather than abuse. When the children have made remarks about their parents hurting them, they have not been accompanied by signs of fear or distress. To the contrary the remarks are often made accompanied by positive remarks about their parents and/or wanting to go home or see them. J has been obviously distressed when making allegations against his cousin, which were in fact untrue. 

 

J makes numerous allegations mentioning his father, it is surprising that L makes no reference to these if they had indeed occurred. This suggests that any allegations J makes against his father are unreliable. 

 

Why are children saying these things, about their parents and other adults and children? It is not necessary for me to decide this in order to make fact finding decisions (Re M 2013 2FLR 874) but I have tried to look at all of the evidence and work it out.

 

I consider it likely that these 2 children are confused about the return home, trying to make sense of why (and it from the Social Workers' evidence that no real work was carried out with them about that) and confused at then being separated from each other again. MR told the court that no specific advice was given to her as to preparing J for his return home. CB told the court that she could not recall any specific work being done with the children or their carers to prepare for the return home. GE has produced 2 file notes of visits. Having read these I am not satisfied that any proper explanatory and preparatory work was done with the children to explain their permanent return home, and I accept MRs' evidence that she received no advice about this. This may well have contributed to the children's confusion. The exercise which the 2 Social Workers carried out on 9.7.13 and 18.7.13 respectively with a drawing of 3 houses and talking about who lives in each may well have caused confusion. 

 

Dr H and Ms CT agreed that the children's statements could reflect their trying to process the significant events of the past ie the mother's assault on P and P's assault on her aunt MP. Perhaps they were trying to make sense of why they had been removed from their parents care in August 2012? Perhaps they were unsure how long they would remain there? Ms CT thought this might fit. Dr H said it was not possible to separate what may be the children's experience of the parents, and what may be trauma from other incidents they have witnessed

 

It is accepted that the children had frequent contact with P from August 2012, L was placed with P initially. It is more likely than not that the children will have heard P talk about being hit by their mother. MR told the court that the family (rightly) disapproved of the mother's assault on P and that the family spoke about this when the children were both in and out of the house. 

 

Ms C said that J was desperate for attention a lot of the time. His allegations made in June and September gave him attention it seems. I accept MRs' evidence that J liked to have an audience, as his carer for over a year she will know him well. 

 

It appears that hitting and rough play was part of the children's lives, with each other and with their cousins. 

 

On 19.9.13 as every day L and J had a lot of access to each other in class and in playground. Once school ended at 3.15pm they had open access to each other until the police arrived almost 2 hours later. I have dealt with this in some detail in the chronology above. 

 

The parents co-operated with the children leaving with the Social Workers on 19.9.13, this co-operation is likely to have assisted the children. The mother says that J had wet himself; she felt this as she hugged him, there was no challenge to this evidence. CB said there was further wetting since the parents had left. I cannot draw from the LA evidence that the children showed little distress which is in some way corroborative of a complaint of ill treatment.

 

ALLEGATION 10

 

The LA relies on evidence that J was aggressive in the waiting room for the Child Protection medical and hit a child. Given that J had been removed from school by Social Workers the day before, taken to his aunt's home, taken to hospital for a medical, if he was acting out, there is no possible connection to his mother's care in my judgment. He was probably very confused by the events of the preceding day and weeks. 

According to his teacher there was nothing remarkable about J's behaviour until after he was removed on 19.9.13. The Headteacher Ms S said the incidents of concern seemed to have occurred after this date. 

The parents had supervised contact with the children; any suggestions from the children that they were being aggressive because the mother told them to are incompatible with the contact supervision records which reveal nothing of the sort. I have not been shown all of the contact notes but the LA has referred me to various notes on different points. 

Any incidents of aggression cannot be linked to parental care.

I have considered with some care all of the oral and written evidence and ABE interview. The evidence taken as a whole does not come even close to the necessary standard of proof of a balance of probabilities. I am not at all satisfied that either parent together or apart has physically harmed L or J. The allegations in the schedule 2-12 are dismissed.

 

WORKING WITH PROFESSIONALS

 

The LA seeks a finding that "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals." 

The LA asserts in submissions that the parents are able to work with some professionals at times and that that their engagement is not always consistent. This is probably accurate. 

At the time of the making of the Supervision Order on 12.9.13 the parents were willing to sign a Working Agreement but at that stage the father was not convinced of the need for him to engage in the Family Recovery Project given the evidence in the earlier proceedings. He said in evidence that he was willing to consider engaging in the Family Recovery Project but had not come to a decision (by 7 days later when this case began again) wanting more information as to its time commitments and how it might affect his college/work before he decided. The father has not sought to prevent the mother or the children engaging.

 

The mother did not want the children to see her sisters until she had resolved the issues in the sisters' relationship and wanted to introduce contact when she felt it appropriate. The mother did not want the Social Workers to see children at school, but was willing for them to be seen at home. She submitted a Supervision Order was not necessary, given that she had agreed to the amended Written Agreement. There is no issue that the mother has engaged with the services set out in the working agreement. 

 

The LA submits that they rely on the fact that there were difficulties in reaching an agreement with the parents at court on the last day on the previous proceedings on 12.9.13.

I cannot see how the LA can rely on this as a relevant factor in this Threshold Criteria in these proceedings. It was of great importance to the Social Workers who gave evidence before me; they kept referring back to it and to the one missed SALT appointment for J. In any event the LA provided a "Schedule of Requirements" document on 12.9.13, it was rightly re-titled "Working Agreement" but the LA still sought that it be signed up to. After legal advice and discussions the parents made it clear that they would sign the amended "Working Agreement" document which I have seen. It is entirely reasonable, and I note that the District Judge went on to make Supervision Orders, agreeing that the children's welfare was best met in the care of their parents. 

I am entirely satisfied that the parents have worked openly with a number of professionals namely CAMHS, Ms CT, the police, the mother with probation, the school and the Children's Guardian.

 

The parents have attended all core group, Child Protection meetings and Looked After Children reviews from August 2012 to date. The mother did not attend J's first SALT appointment; she has attended the rest successfully. Her probation officer on 16.7.13 suggested the distance to the SALT was excessive for the parents.

The mother has engaged and co-operated with Meanwhile Therapy, and willing to engage with the Family Recovery Project. GE in cross examination accepted that there was very little the parents haven't got the children to and that the parents have put in an incredible amount of effort. He said that the father was for the most part reasonable and easy to work with. 

On 19.9.13 according to the school staff the parents co-operated patiently in the most difficult of circumstances.

The parents have demonstrated a working relationship with a number of professionals. 

The parents have been living under huge strain. The children returned home after one year and then all 3 were removed after 5 weeks of L and J at home, baby KR then aged less than 4 months. Despite a positive kinship assessment of the father's mother upon the LA's own instruction, the Social Work team refused to place any of the children with her, and have not provided any real explanation as to why they do not follow this positive recommendation. The LA position one week after removal last September was that there should be no further assessments or rehabilitation. I agree with Ms CT that this was completely inappropriate.

 

The mother wished to breast feed baby KR, it took the LA 2 weeks to provide a breast pump. This is hardly working in co-operation with parents who hold parental responsibility. 

The LA relies on inappropriate comments made by the parents in contact and 4 contact notes were provided. I will be frank; I thought I had been given the wrong notes. There is almost nothing untoward at all in these notes. The mother is referred therein to being discreet in her discussions with the supervisor and if anything I was pleased to read such positive accounts from the independent sources at contact.

I am not at all satisfied that "the parents are unable to work consistently and openly with professionals."  

Even if I were so satisfied � in circumstances where no other finding is made, this one line alone cannot found the basis for threshold criteria being met. 

The parents mistrust the Social Work team. There is a Supervision Order in force, the LA must advise, assist and befriend the family. The parents must allow them to do this. I strongly encourage senior management to approve a change of SW team. A fresh approach to this family is vital. Working in co-operation with this team would be very difficult for any family given the Social Workers' clear view, even before the fact finding hearing, that the children could not be returned to their parents, a Social Work team who made arrangements for an adoption family finding Social Worker to visit the children during the days of this hearing (fortunately this was stopped before it took place), a Social Work team who have not, in my view, taken a proportionate and measured view of the evidence as it arose. 

The LA were right to investigate once J had made his allegations, but a proper and detailed analysis of the evidence leads me in no doubt at all that the findings sought should be dismissed.

 

I encourage the father to find out more about the Family Recovery Project and to give it serious consideration. 

 

The 2 children need therapeutic input to help them make sense of the events of their young lives. 

The Threshold Criteria not being met, I encourage the parties to have discussions about the children's return home, how they can be prepared for that and how it can be properly explained, I fully expect the parents to co-operate with a s20 agreement for a short time to enable the return home to have the best possible chance of success.

JUDGMENT

 

1.                 
THE JUDGE:� I have been concerned with the welfare of two boys: 

A B-R, who was born on 26th
December 2009; and his younger brother, 

R B-R, born on 8th March
2011.

2.                 
The local authority, the London Borough of Lewisham, has been
represented throughout this final hearing by counsel, Mr Dean. The boys� mother
is Ms B and she has been represented by her counsel, Miss Peacock.� The
children�s father, Mr R, who shares parental responsibility for both children
with the mother, is represented by his solicitor, Miss Holland.� The children
themselves have been represented throughout the final hearing by their
solicitor advocate, Miss Hindle.� The guardian is present at court today.� Miss
Wilson, who is actually the solicitor for the children, has been unavoidably
detained this morning and may come into court later. The maternal grandmother
is also a party to the proceedings.� Her husband in fact was not joined as a
party. She has acted in person throughout the final hearing.� 

3.                 
The local authority has applied for a care order and a placement order
in respect of the two boys.� The final hearing at Kingston County Court took
place on 29th to 31st January following a reading day on
28th January.� The case was transferred from the Inner London and
City Family Proceedings Court where it had been case managed for 54 weeks, a
very long time.� The purpose of transfer to this court was because this court
could offer an earlier final hearing than the Family Proceedings Court.

4.                 
The issues were stark.� Should the court make a care order and a
placement order in respect of each boy so that they are placed for adoption
outside the birth family, the local authority�s proposal which was opposed by
all parties.� Or should the boys be made the subject of special guardianship orders
to the grandparents.� That proposal was supported by the boys� parents at the
final hearing, although they had not previously supported it, and by the
guardian.

5.                 
After hearing all of the evidence and submissions I indicated to the
parties that I could give an outline of my decision, and that I would list the
matter for judgment today, 11th February.� My decision was that the
parents cannot, either separately or together, provide good enough care to
either child.� The parents accepted that and did not put themselves forward in
the final hearing.� I dismissed the application by the local authority for a
care order and a placement order and I indicated that I would make a special
guardianship order to the grandparents.� I also gave an indication of my views
following submissions about the transition plan to the grandparents, and about
the contents of a written agreement and matters which I hoped would be added to
the special guardianship support plan.� Despite special guardianship not being
the local authority�s proposal it has, appropriately, filed and served a
support plan in the event that the court made a special guardianship order
which was in line with the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in the case of
Re: W [2013] EWCA Civ 1227.

6.                 
In light of the fact that the parents did not put themselves forward as
carers for the boys, accepting realistically that they could not provide good
enough parenting for them, this judgment does not go in detail into the merits
of the assessments of the parents.� If, in the future, there is any further
litigation in relation to these boys all of the court bundle which was
available to the court at this hearing needs to be considered, including,
importantly, the reports relating to the parents� ability.

7.                 
I find the threshold met as set out in the final composite threshold
document dated 20th December 2013.� The threshold document will
be attached to the orders which I make today.� In brief at the relevant date,
22nd November 2012 both of the children were suffering or likely to
suffer significant harm attributable to the care given to them, or likely to be
given to them if an order were not made.� The parents maintained a
relationship.� The local authority alleged that that was characterised by
domestic violence to which the boys were exposed.� The father accepted that
their relationship involved volatility and arguments. �The mother accepts that
she had a volatile relationship with the father but not to the extent reflected
in the papers.� The mother has a history of dishonesty and failing to engage
with professionals in her dealings with them regarding the care of the
children.� The mother has neglected the physical and emotional needs of the
children.� She failed to prioritise their needs and failed to provide basic
care, emotional warmth and supervision.

8.                 
The grandmother had two children, A and R, when she was a teenager.� She
then began her relationship with the grandfather in about 1988.� Twenty five
years later they are still together and they married on 30th June 2012 and the grandfather took on the mother�s elder two children as his own.

9.                 
The grandparents, in 1988, took on the care of the mother�s two
nephews.� At that time their daughter (the mother of the two children with whom
I am concerned), was about the same age as A, her cousin.� The mother�s
behaviour became a concern to the grandparents from about 2006 when she was
16.� Over the years she has made a large number of allegations against her
family and against others not in her family.� I have seen a detailed psychological
assessment which, amongst other things, says that the mother exaggerates and
sometimes fabricates events in an impulsive manner.

10.             
In 2009 the grandparents� daughter, L, had a brain injury.� L is now
aged 18 and lives at home.� I have heard that she had to learn to walk and
speak again, which she could not have done without the support and complete
dedication of her parents according to L.� The grandmother assists L still now
with some care tasks, for example, hair washing.

11.             
The younger nephew is aged 21.� He has been in prison for a four month
prison sentence, having been involved in the London riots.� He met with the
assessor, as part of the proceedings, who described him as friendly and
articulate.� He lives still with the grandparents.� The older nephew is now
aged 23.� He had been living with the grandparents until last year when he
moved out to live in a hostel.� He has been sentenced to two prison sentences,
including for his involvement in the London riots.� It appears from the special
guardianship assessment that both nephews were very supportive and positive
about their aunt and uncle, who I shall refer to as the grandparents.

12.             
Contained in the court bundle is a long report from a Residential Unit where
the mother underwent an assessment.� The outcome of that was negative.� In
addition there are psychological assessments of the father and the mother by
Dr C.� Importantly, for the purpose of the issues in this case, there is a
special guardianship assessment carried out by the local authority permanence
team.� It did not recommend a special guardianship order to the grandparents.

13.             
The boys have been placed together in foster care throughout these long
proceedings and their grandparents have weekly supervised contact.� The
mother�s last contact with the boys was almost a year ago in early April 2013.�
The father�s was at a similar time.� Neither parent has sought contact since.�
If it were not for the grandparents these two small boys would have been
without family contact.

14.             
The mother and father attended the hearing before me on every day and
they are here today for judgment.� Handwritten statements were prepared which
they signed.� The parents are still a couple.� They live together in the London
Borough of Enfield.� When they came to court they said that they fully
supported the children being placed with the mother�s parents in Hackney.� This
had been a recent change of position.

15.             
The law which I have had to consider when looking at the options for the
boys can be summarised quite briefly.� Their welfare has to be my paramount
consideration.� The welfare checklist which is set out at section 1(3) of the
Children Act 1989 and section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 is
highly relevant and I have taken it into account when considering the paramountcy
of the boys� welfare.

16.             
I have to have regard to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human
Rights.� I should only interfere with the children�s and the parties� right to
family life in circumstances where I consider it necessary and proportionate to
do so.� Following the Supreme Court�s decision in 2012 in the case of Re: B
and the line of authorities in the Court of Appeal of last year, including the
case of Re: B-S, courts have been particularly alert and concerned to
ensure that when an application for a placement order and a care plan for
adoption is placed before a court the court scrutinises the evidence to
consider whether it is indeed necessary and proportionate to make such
placement orders which would have the effect of severing birth family ties.

17.             
I heard evidence from a number of witnesses to which I will refer now.�
The solicitor for the guardian in her written submissions prepared a summary of
the evidence of the witnesses which I have found very helpful when I was
preparing my judgment and I include some of the summaries now.

18.             
The allocated social worker was CYT, he accepted the following in
relation to the grandparents� care of their nephews.� There was no Social
Services involvement with any of the grandparents� own children when children.�
The nephews moved to live with the grandparents in an unplanned way.� It was
very unlikely that the grandparents would have known about their nephews
problems in the circumstances of their move and by the time that they moved in
with the grandparents the nephews had already suffered very severe neglect for
many years, exposed to domestic violence and to alcoholic parents.�
Furthermore, A had been sexually abused.� It was reasonably foreseeable that
the nephews would exhibit behavioural difficulties as a consequence of the
parenting they had received and reasonably foreseeable that support would be
required from a local authority, their local authority at that time being
Hackney.� There was no evidence of any support being provided to the
grandparents to meet the nephews� needs between 1999 and 2003.� When support
services were offered by the London Borough of Hackney in 2003 there is no
suggestion that the grandparents failed to accept those services.� But by 2003
the elder nephew�s school was having considerable difficulty managing his
behaviour which resulted in him being excluded for a limited period.� There was
no evidence of the grandmother having sabotaged attempts to support her and the
boys, the word �sabotage� being used in a chronology prepared by this local
authority upon reading of the Hackney files.� The grandmother regularly sought
help from the London Borough of Hackney and did not seek to hide the
difficulties she and her husband were experiencing.� It was not clear whether
family therapy was offered but there was no evidence of failure to attend if it
had been offered.

19.             
The social worker was referred to his addendum statement of 15th
January when he said this:� �It is highly likely that should the boys be placed
with their grandparents that they would have similar poor outcomes�, ie, to
those of the grandparents� own children and of the nephews.� When he was asked
in cross-examination how it was that he came to that conclusion the social
worker confirmed he had never been to the grandparents� home, never met their
daughter, L, and had no information about the elder sons.� He did not know
whether they had any children.� He had not observed contact between the
grandparents and the children.� He had not seen the grandparents interact with L,
or the 2 elder sons.

20.             
The social worker said that he had based his opinion on the likely
future outcome for the boys on the information from the London Borough of
Hackney and from what he had been told.� He confirmed that prior to reaching
the decision that adoption was in the children�s best interests he had not
considered whether the children could be placed under a special guardianship
order and supervision orders with their grandparents, he had not considered the
children being placed subject to child in need plans under a special
guardianship order, nor had he considered the children being placed with their
grandparents under care orders.

21.             
The allocated social worker confirmed that in the event an adoptive
placement for the boys together could not be found the local authority would
change their plan to one of long term fostering.� He said that the local
authority�s alternative plan was for the boys to remain with their current
foster carers, but that they had not yet even been approved as long term foster
carers generally, nor indeed matched to these boys.

22.             
The social worker, when asked about the special guardianship support
plan, accepted that the support set out in the plan at that point filed by the
local authority, at E298, was generic and not particularly tailored to the
needs of these boys.� He accepted it would be beneficial for support to be put
into place to enable the Bs to attend a course to help them learn about
attachment and how to manage the boys at an early stage and that the additional
support that Anthony was receiving at nursery should continue.

23.             
My impression is that the allocated social worker relied heavily,
perhaps partially understandably, on the special guardianship assessment of the
grandparents.� But as the allocated social worker I considered that he had
provided no real scrutiny of a chronology that had been prepared by his
colleague upon reading the London Borough of Hackney files.� There was, I felt,
inadequate consideration of the pros and cons of the relevant placement options
and a completely insufficient balance of the pros and cons for the boys.

24.             
I heard from SW, a family finding social worker.� She confirmed that an
adoptive search would take place for up to a year.� She confirmed that the
estimated timescale which is included in her statement was based on her recent
experience in finding a placement for children with a similar profile, but the
fact that these boys are boys who have a developmental delay requiring a
placement together would make it harder to find a placement.� She told the
court that there was currently one approved family which she considered may be
interested in caring for the boys.� Miss Wilson, I thought, was doing her best
to answer relevant questions that were being put to her.

25.             
I heard from Miss AS.� She prepared a special guardianship assessment of
the grandparents.� Her summary begins at E261 of the bundle and I will
summarise what she says:� 

�I fully appreciate how much
they want to care for their grandchildren, that they want to keep them within
the birth family.� Their commitments and intentions are sincere.� They would do
everything in their power and within their capacity to make it right for the
children.� 

The boys need carers that can
make them feel loved and give them a sense of belonging.� The grandparents are
well equipped to do this.� However, the acrimonious and highly tense
relationship between the grandparents and the children�s own parents would make
it very difficult for them to bring up [the boys] in an environment away from
conflict and tension.� They would struggle to shelter the children from
conflict and their moving house to a neighbouring borough, should this be
feasible [which had then previously been the proposal but is no longer] would
not solve the problems or counteract the risks.� 

The boys have experienced
emotional neglect, lack of consistent warmth in the care of their parents and
for their progress to continue they need an environment where they are loved
[which I know the grandparents can offer] and where there is also harmony and
predictability.� The grandparents� household is hectic, loud and busy.� The
adults get on well most of the time but tend to engage in disagreements and
arguments.� The boys would not stay the centre of attention for long and this
would have a negative impact on their progress.� Any disruption will have a
detrimental effect on them.� I believe that the children�s parents would find
ways to destabilise the children�s placement and that the grandmother in
particular would find it difficult to diffuse any conflict caused by the
parents.� 

Emotions are very high between
the two extended families and there is a lot of resentment on both parts.� A
lot of reparatory work would need to be done between the grandparents and
parents for things to change significantly. �The grandparents have
disagreements and difficulties over their respective parenting styles and this
was a problem when they were bringing up [their nephews and the boys� mother]
and in the absence of any change this will be a problem again if they are entrusted
with their grandchildren.�� 

So she does not recommend the children
are placed on a permanent basis under a special guardianship order or any other
provision.� She then goes on to say:� 

�Notwithstanding my
recommendations it is also my view that [the boys] have a positive and close
relationship with their grandparents and this, if possible, should be taken
into consideration when making plans for their permanent care.�

26.             
The special guardianship assessor�s colleague, Miss B, read the London
Borough of Hackney files in relation to the grandparents and their children and
prepared a chronology.� It is attached to the assessor�s report.� The special
guardianship assessor confirmed that that Hackney chronology, whilst not
forming the foundation on which her assessment was based, was very significant
and was her main source of information for the period 1998 to 2006.� She, like
the allocated social worker, accepted that there was no evidence of support
being provided between 1999 and 2003 and that in early 2003 direct social work
support had been in place for about three weeks.� She suggested there were gaps
in the chronology and that there may be additional information not in the
chronology which would indicate that direct support was provided for longer.� However,
she accepted it was impossible for her to know whether information left out of
the chronology was positive or negative.

27.             
She accepted, as did the allocated social worker, that it was reasonable
to conclude that the situation at home with the nephews may have been
deteriorating by 2003 in light of the nephews� own difficulties and lack of
support.� She accepted again that there was limited reference to support
between 2003 and 2006 and that when requested by the grandmother support
appeared to have been put into place following requests.

28.             
In relation to whether family therapy was offered by Hackney and turned
down by the extended family she suggested that in her experience as a social
worker, given the circumstances the family was in by 2006, a referral would
definitely have been made and that the grandparents� presentation to her during
her assessment indicated they had failed to engage.� She said:� �I have a view
that it was not taken up.�

29.             
With reference to the mother, the assessor said that her relationship
with her parents, in particular her own mother, had been difficult when a
teenager and that the first reference to her being a concern was when the
mother was almost 16.� She accepted that the grandmother had engaged with
social workers to try and improve that relationship but remained concerned
about the grandparents� insight into their role into the mother�s own
difficulties.� She accepted it was common in situations where a family member
was seeking to care for a relative�s child within care proceedings for there to
be tension and difficulties.� She also went on to accept that the important
factor was how the relatives reacted if the parents did cause difficulties.�
She said it was positive that the parents have said within these proceedings
that they do now support the grandparents, but she could not attach any weight
to that because that was a sudden and, to her, unexplained change of heart.

30.             
She repeated on a number of occasions her concern that the grandmother
may overreact to situations, potentially exposing the children to her own
heightened sense of alarm or to unnecessary confrontation.� She also
highlighted her concern about the grandparents� ability to maintain a unified
approach to parenting and she thought that Mrs H-B may suffer strain or
possibly depression as a consequence of the difficulties that may arise looking
after her grandchildren.� However, she did accept that there was no evidence of
the grandmother having suffered from depression since 2006, including in the
period following L�s brain haemorrhage in 2009. The assessor felt that she was
in difficulties in setting out the extent to which the grandparents� ability to
care for their grandchildren would be impacted by their responsibilities to
L.

31.             
She said she had limited information about their older children but said
that she had not been made aware of anything of concern in relation to those
two young men and their children.� 

32.             
She accepted when it was put to her that the grandparents had had to
undergo and adapt to significant changes in their own lives, firstly when their
young nephews came to live with them in 1998, secondly when L had a
haemorrhage.� She acknowledged that the grandparents had made changes and stuck
together as a couple through very difficult times.

33.             
My strong impression is that the special guardianship assessor gave
inadequate consideration to the differences in the potential placement of the
boys as against the actual placement of the nephews back in 1998 and inadequate
consideration of the very limited support offered by the London Borough of
Hackney to already troubled boys and their carers.� I felt she gave inadequate
consideration to the positives that these grandparents can offer their
grandchildren.

34.             
The children�s mother gave some limited evidence.� She provided a
handwritten statement to say that she had not supported her parents out of
spite previously but strongly supports them now.� She did not seek to
contradict or challenge the wealth of evidence about herself and her own
parenting. 

35.             
The father did not give evidence, nor was he required to do so.� He,
like the mother, attended court every day.� He had not been in contact with his
solicitor from late August until attendance at this hearing in late January.�
In his handwritten statement he accepted that there would have to be a risk
assessment of his contact to the children.� He says that he wants to mend
bridges with the mother�s parents and, like the mother, he said that in the
past out of spite he had said nasty things about them.� Neither parent, as I
have said, sought to challenge the local authority�s position that the children
cannot be cared for by them together or separately.

36.             
I heard from Mr B and Mrs H-B.� Mr B told me about 26-year-old R who is
married with two children, he is a working man, and of A, aged 27, who has had a
partner, for about seven or eight years with two children, who is also a
working man and that he and his wife see their grandchildren approximately
weekly.� He told me about L, who is aged 18 and is at college now, and about her
brain injury.� He gave the date immediately, 15th February 2009.� He, like L�s mother, gave some description of the help that L needs with day to
day tasks and about the encouragement that he was giving L to be independent.�
He described a reasonably good relationship with both A, who has his own flat
and who visits several times a week including staying with the Bs when there
was some problem with gas in his own flat, and he described his relationship
quite positively with his other nephew who still lives with them.

37.             
The maternal grandmother gave a moving account to the court on how on 13th July 1998
she went to collect her own children from school and her nephew ran to her
pleading not to go into care.� She told me how filthy he was with head lice.�
On the next school day, which I think was the following Monday, her younger
nephew came home with her husband as no one had collected him from school.�
They have remained as part of the family ever since.� She also provided some
more information than I had read about in the papers about how troubled her two
nephews had been by their earlier experiences.� A had suffered foetal alcohol
syndrome, his brother had been diagnosed with ADHD and learning difficulties.

38.             
Both of the grandparents accepted that looking after the nephews had
placed a strain on their husband and wife relationship.� Mr B told me that at
one point he reached the point when he could not stand the strain of looking
after them and he spent a period living away from home.� He said that there
were differences in the parenting styles that he and his wife adopted but they
would usually reach a point when they would take a common approach.� They both
told the court that they received no help from the London Borough of Hackney
between 1999 and 2003, in other words, the four years following the boys� being
placed with them, other than the provision of �35 to buy clothes and beds, a
one off payment, not a weekly payment.� They told the court that the help they
had received between 2003 and 2006 from Hackney had been patchy.� It was clear
that for a short time in 2003 what appears to be a family support worker did
provide some assistance but it was only for a limited period.� In relation to
the boys� medical diagnoses which I have just referred to no assistance or
guidance had been given the grandmother told me.� As to family therapy neither
grandparent could recall it actually being offered, although the grandmother
could recall there being discussion about whether there should be any family
therapy.

39.             
As to their relationship with their daughter, the children�s mother, the
grandmother described that relationship as better than it had been, although
not fine.� She thought it had improved since about shortly before Christmas.�
She told me that she would never be friends with the children�s father but she
thought it was significant that they did all want the same outcome in these
proceedings, which was for the boys to remain within their family.� She also
told me how the children�s father had apologised to her the week previously to
her giving evidence.

40.             
Mrs H-B said that in relation to L that she had been in receipt of
higher rate Disability Living Allowance but that had reduced to middle rate in
2012 and there is a review in May of this year.� She described the limited help
to L that she provides because L�s mobility on her right side is affected to a
degree.� L wishes to be as independent as possible according to both her
parents.

41.             
As to the question of the extended paternal family and the potential for
difficulties between them and the maternal family, the grandmother confirmed to
me that she no longer considered, as she had said to the special guardianship
assessor, that they would need to move house before caring for the boys because
the father�s step-father, who had lived near them and had previously made
threats to her family, was no longer living in the area.� She told me about the
sums that she has paid to bring down her rent arrears and was hopeful as a
result that in any event the family would be able to move to larger
accommodation, still within the area, in the reasonably near future.� They want
to stay within the area because of their support network.� Both grandparents
work part time.

42.             
The children�s guardian gave evidence and spoke to her final analysis.�
She emphasised that her position remained the same after hearing the oral
evidence.� She does not support the local authority�s application for care and
placement orders and supported special guardianship orders to the
grandparents.� She recognised that there were risks associated with that
placement but considered that the local authority�s balancing exercise was
flawed, placing undue weight upon the information within the Hackney chronology
which appears to have been interpreted quite negatively by the special
guardianship assessor and read without scrutiny by the allocated social worker.

43.             
The guardian did not suggest that there were not very significant
difficulties in the grandparents� family home when they were caring initially
for their nephews and indeed in the years following, but it was the guardian�s
position that the local authority has judged the grandparents� difficulties in
caring for their nephews with very limited consideration of the circumstances
in which they went to live with the grandparents and the limited support and
advice they had received.� The guardian was also of the view the local
authority has failed to take into account the positive outcomes for the
grandparents� children, L R and A.

44.             
The guardian asked me to consider the different ages at which the boys
ceased to be cared for by their parents when they were really quite small
compared to the nephews.� She thought it was a positive that the grandparents
have had the opportunity to get to know their grandchildren over a long period of
weekly contact.� In fact another difference now as opposed to the nephews�
situation is that there are no other minor children in the grandparents�
household and if they are to move to the grandparents this would be a planned
move.� The guardian gave balanced evidence which I found thoughtful, realistic
and compelling.� 

45.             
The role of the court in proceedings such as this is to evaluate the
appropriate placement options for both of these boys based on the evidence
which the court has.� A plan for adoption should only be approved if it is the
only course possible which is in a child�s best interests, ie, nothing else
will do.� Professionals who have the responsibility of putting forward a plan
for adoption must show that they have covered all placement options with an
analysis for and against each.

46.             
The boys both have developmental delay.� They have made great progress
in foster care and I would like to congratulate the foster carers and hope that
will be passed on to the foster carers.� They have clearly worked very hard
with the boys who had suffered great neglect in their parents� care.� 

47.             
Clearly the boys need active, hands on carers.� The question is can the
grandparents provide good enough parenting for these boys with their particular
needs?� The grandparents have had some very significant life events to deal
with, notably when they took on the care of the grandmother�s nephews in 1998
and when L had a brain haemorrhage in 2009.� They have remained together as a
couple for over 25 years and married in 2012. �They appear to me to be open and
honest when they gave their evidence.� They did not appear to minimise the
difficulties which they have had with their nephews.� Their nephews suffered
poor parenting from their own birth parents and had suffered very severe
neglect for many years, exposure to domestic violence and alcoholic parents.�
They moved to the care of the grandparents in a very unplanned way.� It was
reasonably foreseeable that the nephews would exhibit behavioural difficulties
as a consequence of their birth parents� care, or lack of care.� It was
reasonably foreseeable that support would be needed from the grandparents�
local authority, but I could see no evidence of support provided between 1999
and 2003, save a small one off payment.� When support was offered in 2003 there
is no suggestion that the grandparents failed to accept it, and by then A�s
school was having difficulties in managing him.� There is no evidence of the
grandmother having �sabotaged�, which is Lewisham�s word, attempts to support
her and her nephews.

48.             
As I read the evidence she regularly sought help from the London Borough
of Hackney and did not seek to hide the difficulties that she and her husband
were experiencing.� I accept Mr and Mrs H-B�s account that in the period 2003
to 2006 any help was patchy and they received no help at any time in respect of
their nephews� diagnoses of ADHD, learning difficulties and A�s foetal alcohol
syndrome.� I accept the grandmother�s evidence that family therapy was
discussed with her and her husband and that her husband was more reluctant than
she was, but that it was not offered and therefore not refused.

49.             
The chronology of the London Borough of Hackney files prepared by the
London Borough of Lewisham social worker was interpreted quite unnecessarily
negatively by the special guardianship assessor.� It is my conclusion that the
London Borough of Lewisham have carried out a flawed balancing exercise and
have failed to consider sufficiently the circumstances in which the nephews
went to live with the grandparents and the limited support they received at
that time and subsequently.� The local authority has completely ignored the
positive outcomes for the B�s other child, L, and the elder boys.� They have
simply not looked at the difference in the grandchildren�s situation as
compared to the nephews� situation.� The nephews moved in a very unplanned
way.� The grandparents have had the opportunity for weekly contact to their
grandchildren over the last year and therefore have been able to get to know the
boys, including their behaviour, well.� This will be a planned move with the
practical support of the London Borough of Lewisham.� 

50.             
I have to record that I found it simply astonishing that the allocated
social worker said in his statement of 15th January:� �It is
highly likely that should the boys be placed with their grandparents they would
have similar poor outcomes.�� He said that in circumstances where he had never
been to the B�s home, never met L, had no information about the older sons and
had not observed contact between the grandparents and the boys.

51.             
It appears to me that the grandparents have managed very well with the
trauma that was L�s brain injury, provided her with a balance of parental
support and encouragement to independence.� I do not see that the level of care
that L requires prevents them from having enough time to care for their
grandchildren well.� Having heard from them in evidence I am satisfied that
they are aware of the risk that the children�s parents pose if they were to
have unsupervised or unscheduled contact.� The London Borough of Lewisham needs
to advise the grandparents on how to respond to any requests by either parent
for unscheduled or unsupervised contact.� But having heard from the
grandparents I am satisfied that they will comply with the written agreement to
that effect.� 

52.             
I accept that the improvement in the parents� and grandparents�
relationship is recent.� The courts have to be very alive to convenient
rapprochement between parents and grandparents in this way.� Quite rightly this
was explored with the grandparents in cross-examination.� But I am confident,
having heard them give evidence, that the grandparents will seek help from the
local authority if it is required.� As the father�s solicitor submitted very realistically,
in her submissions, Mr R has sat in court for three days.� He is a man who
has a history of anger difficulties.� If his support for the grandparents was
false and his previous description of them was true Miss Holland invited me to
consider whether or not Mr R would have been able to sit here for quite so
long, and I agree with her.

53.             
The local authority evidence did not contain the analysis which is
required in relation to each potential placement or order.� It did not contain
evidence to satisfy me that adoption is the only necessary and proportionate
order.� When I set out a summary of his oral evidence I set out that the social
worker had not considered whether the boys could be placed with the
grandparents under different types of orders.� This is very surprising in light
of the recent Court of Appeal line of authorities on this very point.

54.             
I consider that the special guardianship assessor was wrong to
extrapolate conclusions from the chronology that the grandparents had not taken
up family therapy in the past.� She said it �wearing her social work hat� she
claimed, extrapolating conclusions that they could not have taken up family
therapy from their responses in her own interview with them.� The special
guardianship assessor acknowledged that there were gaps in the Hackney
chronology, for example, there was not a reference to the family therapy being
offered, but she concluded that meant that the grandparents had not taken it
up.� She was quick to interpret negatively the Hackney chronology, both what it
said and what the potential gaps were.

55.             
The guardian has looked holistically at the different options.� I
thought she was balanced in her approach.� I have no hesitation in preferring
the professional recommendation of the guardian to that of the allocated social
worker and special guardianship assessor.� The latter have given very little
regard to the manner in which the nephews went to live with the grandparents
and the limited support provided thereafter, as I have repeated in this
judgment.� They have failed to consider the positive outcomes of the B�s other
children.� They preferred to concentrate on the difficult recent history of the
nephews as the social worker himself set out in his own statement which I have
quoted.

56.             
Importantly the local authority appears not to have looked holistically
at the options and asked itself the vital question, is adoption really the only
safe, necessary, proportionate option for the boys given that it will deprive
them of their birth family?

57.             
When I asked the social worker about his plans for contact to the
grandparents if the adoption plan was approved he said this:� �Normally under a
care order the local authority does not encourage contact with birth families,
but it is the one thing that was not looked at at this point in time.�� I am
quite surprised that it was not looked at at this point in time, bearing in
mind section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act, but in fact it now does not
matter because that is not an order I am going to make.

58.             
There is a certainty that I heard from committed, loving grandparents
who want the best for their two grandsons.� It is a certainty that this is a
couple who have been together for over 25 years, facing numbers of family
problems.� There are risks to the placement with the grandparents.� There is a
risk that the recent improvement in the parental relationship may not be
sustained.� I do consider that, with help, this relationship between the
parents and grandparents can be worked upon.� I am satisfied that the
grandparents will seek support and maintain support and accept support from the
local authority if necessary.

59.             
Placement for adoption is most uncertain, either whether a placement can
be found for adoption, as to how long that placement search would be and there
is the potential for two boys, age 4 and 3, with developmental delay, with some
behavioural difficulties although those have improved more recently, being
found a placement together for adoption.� As a result of the orders that I am
going to make today I can assist in providing some certainty for these two
little boys.� Their welfare undoubtedly requires they move to live with the
grandparents under a special guardianship order.

60.             
As to contact with the father it is agreed that there should be a risk
assessment by the local authority before there is any consideration of
contact.� The fact that he accepts there should be a risk assessment is a good
indicator.� The local authority�s own evidence says that he has shown insight
into the local authority concerns about the children.� Again, a good indicator.�
The grandparents, I am confident, will be able to manage contact, but I am
equally confident that if they are not able to manage it they will seek
assistance.

61.             
Those are the reasons for the decision which I have made.� Since the
matter was last before me on 31st January the local authority has
filed and served an amended special guardianship support plan which was
provided to the parties as well as a written agreement signed on 4th February.�
I know that the parties want to have some further discussions about this and I
will rise so that that can happen.

The mother of all of the children was EB but she very sadly died on [a date in] 2013.  The father of MB is AW. He is represented in these proceedings by Ms Burns. The father of PB and AL is LL. He is represented at this hearing by Mr Dennett.  AW has played a role in these proceedings but does not have a relationship with MB, having only met him once, and he is not having contact with him at this time. It has been agreed between the parties that whatever my decision on the matters in dispute at this hearing, I should make a parental responsibility order in favour of AW to ensure that he has an on-going role in MB�s life; EB�s death resulting in there being no person other than the local authority holding parental responsibility for MB. However, AW has failed to attend this hearing on any of the four listed days and this has led me to question his commitment to MB. I will consider his application for parental responsibility following delivery of this judgment.  After the death of EB, three family members were made parties to these proceedings, as they wanted to be assessed to care for the children. The first is the maternal grandmother, AB, who has a residence order in respect of EB's older daughter, L, who is aged 11. Also living in that household is a maternal aunt, LG, (dob [a date in] 1995). The other new parties were the maternal great grandparents, who I shall refer to collectively as GGPs and individually as GGF and GGM.  The applications before me today are for care orders in respect of all three children and, in respect of AL, for a placement order. All three children are in foster care and have been since 18th July 2013. Interim care orders were first made on 12 August 2013 and have been regularly renewed ever since. During the proceedings, the children have had contact with LL and GGPs and, on a more limited basis with AB.  
  Background  I am only going to deal briefly with the matters that led to the local authority becoming involved, as this history is not, in fact, key to the decisions I have to make today. MB and PB had been the subjects of child protection plans since July 2012 and AL since January 2013. There were concerns regarding domestic abuse in the mother's relationship with her then partner and about the children being exposed to drug and alcohol misuse. This issue of domestic abuse has to be put in the context of the mother having formed relationships with other violent men in the past. AW has convictions for violence and there were domestic violence incidents between the mother and LL. There were concerns that the children were experiencing neglect as they had missed health appointments and had poor school attendance. There were also concerns about very poor conditions in the home. Indeed, the conditions were so bad on 18 July 2013 that the children were removed from their mother's care. At that time there were no family options for the care of the children so they were placed with agency foster carers. The social work recording of the visit to the home on 18th July, taken from page B7 of the bundle, reads as follows:  �On 18 July 2013 I visited the family home and upon arrival I peered through the living room window with my colleague, Julie Ellis, social work assistant. I saw baby AL lying on the sofa unsupervised and there was a dog (believed to be a prohibited species) in the kitchen. When we knocked on the door the dog came over to the window and started barking. Julie and I continued to knock on the door for about four minutes before EB came to open the door. There was no adult in the living room with AL. EB said that she was upstairs assisting PB and MB to get ready for school. When Julia and I entered the house, there was a strong smell of cannabis and there was clutter on the floor and the room was generally untidy. The smell of cannabis and urine was so overpowering the Julie and I requested the back door and front doors were left open as AL was in the living room where no windows were open and the temperature outdoors was 26�. The house had bluebottle flies flying around and these had to be wafted away from ourselves and the baby. In the kitchen we found a motorcycle and 2 motorcycle tyres on the floor. The kitchen environment was very dirty and there were dishes and clutter everywhere on the worktops and the floors and there were no clean surfaces to prepare food. The sink was full of dirty pots and pans. Julie Ellis asked EB if she had food and she showed her the freezer which contained a selection of food��. EB was asked why her home was in such a state and she told us she had been unwell for the past few days and initially had been having seizures�.    At paragraph 25 on page B8 the bundle the social worker, Ms Vanance, records �Julia and I asked to go to the children's bedroom to check what the children were doing. When we entered the room we found MB standing in the middle of his room. MB was already dressed in his school uniform however it was dirty. PB was standing on the edge of her bed with a dirty white top and she told us she was getting ready��. While in the room we observed the beds did not have any bedcovers on and the mattresses were wet and soaked with urine. The duvets were wet and stained and the smell coming from the children's bedroom was very offensive. We went to the bathroom and there was a pile of washing which was there since Friday 12th of July 2013, when I did a home visit. The bathroom was in a very poor state. The toilet was not cleaned. Excrement and rubbish was on the floor� The statement then describes the room that the mother shared with AL that was in an unacceptable condition. There were bags of dirty nappies, clothes thrown all over the floor. Mouldy food in takeaway cartons and the room had a strong smell of cannabis. The social worker decided that the children could not remain at home with it in this condition and called at the police. The police exercise their powers of protection under section 46 of the Children Act 1989 and the children were removed to foster care. It is appropriate to observe that during this period when Miss Venance was in the home, the mother called her partner, LH, who attended the property and was abusive to the social work staff. He was seen to remove drugs from the property, the mother said he had been keeping at her house for a friend of his. LH also threatened the social worker with his dog. The local authority carried out assessments of the mother and LH. The conclusion of the assessment was negative and the local authority's position was that the children should not be returned to EB�s care. Sadly though, as I have said, the mother died in early December 2013 as a result of being attacked by the dog. Given the mother's death, there is no reason to go into these matters any further detail. The threshold criteria pursuant to section 31(2) Children Act 1989 has been agreed by the parties in the following terms:  �At the time that protective measures were taken, the children were suffering significant harm. The harm was the result of exposure to domestic violence, illicit drug and alcohol abuse by EB, uninhabitable home conditions, missed health appointments and poor school attendance. The harm was attributable to the care given to the children, that care not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give them�.  Turning then to the other family members, at the start of care proceedings the local authority did not have contact details for AW. When AW was located, he asked to be assessed to care for MB. An assessment was undertaken and this appears at C65 of the bundle. The assessment of him and his partner was not positive and he has not sought to challenge this before me, although he does wish to have contact with MB in the future.  The father of the younger two children, LL, also participated in a parenting assessment. That is found at C128 of the bundle. Positives were noted but there were also significant concerns and the local authority�s position is that the children should not be placed in his care. LL does not seek to challenge this although, like AW, he wishes to remain involved in the lives of his children and of MB, who he treated as his own child throughout his relationship with the mother.  Assessments were carried out in respect of extended family members. Some approaches were made to family members who had been put forward by the parents to be assessed but who then decided that they were not able to care for the children. A viability assessment of the maternal grandmother and LG, dated 9th September 2013, did not recommend that a full kinship assessment be undertaken and this recommendation was not challenged at that time. Since the plan for the children became clear and the local authority has recommended that AL be placed for adoption, the maternal grandmother has been made a party to the proceedings and seeks to challenge the assessment, as she does not want AL to be adopted. An addendum assessment was undertaken, dated 16th January 2014, that concluded that AB and LG could not provide good enough care for AL.  Also, once the plan for adoption became clear to the maternal great-grandfather and his wife, they asked to be assessed in respect of AL. They had been approached in July 2013 when the children were first accommodated. I accept what GGF said in his evidence that he and his wife were somewhat taken by surprise that the children were being removed and at the sudden request to look-after them. At the time, GGF said that they could not care for the children. I make it clear now that I do not treat that early refusal as having a negative impact on the case they now argue. It is clear to me that the GGPs very much want to provide care for AL and have pursued that wish in these proceedings. Indeed, they are funding their own representation before me to ensure that their case is fully argued. The assessment of the GGPs was undertaken by the social worker, Paula Steel and appears at C163 of the bundle. The GGPs were joined as parties to these proceedings by the order of 13th January 2014.  
  Issues to be Determined  The key issue for me to determine is where each of the children should spend their childhoods. Central that had been the question of whether they could remain together. The local authority's plan for MB and PB is not opposed by any party. The local authority proposes that they should remain living with their current foster carer and be the subjects of care orders. It is also agreed that they should have ongoing contact with family members.  The local authority's plans in respect of contact have evolved over time. It is proposed that contact between MB and PB with LL should reduce gradually to monthly contact and then remain at that level, subject to ongoing review. MB does not as yet know he has a different father to his sister and dealing with that information will now be more complex for him given the recent loss of his mother. The local authority's plan is that life story work will be carried out with MB, as and when he is able to do this, and that his relationship with AW would be addressed in that context. Appropriate letterbox contact could then start, followed by direct contact in due course. In respect of contact between MB, PB and their extended maternal family, the proposal is for contact to take place seven times a year and that overnight contact with the maternal great grandparents occurs for 1 night at these times. It is proposed that two of the contacts take place in the school summer holidays. The plan involves AB, the children's older sister L, their aunt, LG, and her daughter, A, joining in a family activity during each of these contact sessions. The local authority's plan for AL is for her to be adopted. That obviously means her losing her relationship with her brother and sisters, as well as with her father and extended family. It is proposed that there should be one direct contact session each year between the children if AL's adopters agree. That would be facilitated and attended by the maternal great grandparents. The local authority's plans are supported in their entirety by the guardian. He agrees with the social worker that it is better to separate AL from her siblings and place her for adoption than it is to attempt a family placement with the GGPs.  The family members, including the two fathers, to a great extent have all taken the same position. Their consensus was that the children should be together in foster care but, if that is not achievable, then the maternal great grandparents should care for AL under a residence order. The maternal grandmother says if they cannot care with her support, she seeks to care for her granddaughter herself. However, when she gave her oral evidence to me she accepted that she is not currently in a position to provide care for AL and, in his closing submissions, Mr Hookway did not seek to persuade me that AB should be considered as a carer for AL at this time. This matter was originally listed for final hearing on 26th March 2014 but was adjourned to this hearing to ensure that the position of the current foster carers was fully investigated and accurately reported to the court. At times, the foster carers had said that they would offer to care for AL for the long-term but they did not want to seek adoption or special guardianship orders. A statement from Clare Rogers, the social worker allocated to the foster carers, appears at B64 of the bundle. At B65, there is a summary of a meeting with the foster carers that took place on 26.03.2014. The note reads as follows:  �discussion by Claire Rogers with Karen and Martin. They have been working with a plan for adoption for AL and confirm that they feel this is the best option for her. After thorough consideration and taking into account their own ages (Karen is 49 years old and Martin 50 years old) they believe they could not offer a long-term placement to AL and will work with Leeds local authority�s plan of adoption. They believe they can offer a long, stable and nurturing environment to MB and PB which meets their physical and emotional needs�.  Given that the current foster carer is not offering to care for AL, the position taken by the family members at the start of this hearing was that their first choice would be for MB and PB to remain with the foster carers and for AL to be placed with the great grandparents. The second choice would be for MB and PB to remain with the Foster carers and for AL to be placed with the maternal grandmother. The 3rd choice would be for the 3 children to be placed together in a different foster placement. As I have said, AB is not now pursuing a case that AL should be placed with her and no advocate has pressed a case for the children to be placed in a new foster placement. I heard oral evidence from Paula Steele, the current social worker. She was clear and consistent in her oral evidence. When addressing MB�s needs, she told me he has a good relationship with the foster carer. She said that he had experienced bad neglect and had provided care to other children. She that his experiences have caused him to have additional needs and he can be demanding of attention from his carers. She said he can push the foster carers away and he can get jealous of AL. He thinks that AL was favoured by his mother and asked the foster carers if she is also their favourite. It is the local authority�s intention that MB will receive therapeutic support and lifestory work to understand his experiences and also to advise as to introducing AW into MB�s life. Ms Steele told me that MB is aware that he has a different father but how real this is for him is not clear, as LL has always been the father figure for him. Concerning PB, Ms Steele told me that PB has similar issues to MB. She does demand attention but behaviour is not so problematic as MB.     In her oral evidence, Ms Steele sought to portray AL as a child with additional needs and, on a number of occasions, said that she would require better than good enough care. This was challenged during cross-examination and it became clear that Ms Steele�s views concerned the future emotional needs of AL. Her concerns were not that AL will recall or will suffer any on-going physical consequences of the period of neglect that she experienced when at home for the first 6 months of her life. The issue for Ms Steele is that AL will require support in the future, particularly in her adolescence, to address emotional problems that may arise due to the death of her mother and her separation from her siblings. In his oral evidence the Guardian raised his concern that there may be some lasting impact on AL of the physical and emotional neglect that she experienced when in the care of her mother. However, he accepted that there has not been any indication of difficulty during the period that AL has spent in foster care.      I accept that these are matters that need thought and to which carers must be alive but I am not persuaded that it is right to describe AL as a child who needs better than good enough care. She will need to be treated with sensitivity and understanding when her past is discussed but in my judgment, any child would need similarly sensitive treatment on any number of issues that can arise during childhood and adolescence. Good enough parenting includes accessing advice and support for your child when it is needed and, in my judgment, social care or health services would be able to offer advice to whoever is caring for AL at the time that she may require such advice and support. Given that AL is just 1 year old, I do not approach the competing applications before me on the basis that AL will need an enhanced standard of care beyond that I would expect a carer to give to any child. Ms Steele was clear in her evidence that moving MB and PB to a different foster placement that would accept all 3 children was contrary to the best interests of MB, PB and AL. MB and PB are settled in their current placement. Ms Steele told me that she thought that the local authority would have difficulty in finding a long-term foster placement that could meets the needs of the children together. It is her view that the experiences of the children and the support that they will require might lead to placement breakdown so there was no guarantee that the children would remain together. It is Ms Steele�s opinion that AL is a child who will be easy to place for adoption and that an adoptive placement provides her with the best opportunity for a secure and settled future. She did not accept that it would be in AL�s interests to be in long-term foster care as she would remain a looked-after child and have a corporate parent for the rest of her minority. She said that foster placements can never be guaranteed to be permanent. Ms Steele maintained the views about AB that she set out in her assessment at C154. She is of the opinion that MGM lives a chaotic lifestyle and is not able to protect AL from harm and that the safeguarding concerns for L and the local authority involvement with LG and A preclude AB and LG as potential carers for AL. Ms Steele accepted that AB had not been assessed as a support for the GGPs but she is of the view that any support for the GGPs would need to be immediately available if they caring for AL as the GGPs may fall ill or be otherwise unable to care for AL at any moment.  Concerning the possibility of care by GGPs, Ms Steele said that GGPs are of an age when they would not be able to provide care for AL for the whole of her childhood. She said that they do not have additional family support to help them with AL and their care for her would be likely to end when she reached her teenage years and this is likely to be the most challenging time for AL. She said that the local authority could provide respite and nursery care but this would not address the issues she has with the GGPs as her concerns are long term and not immediate. Parenting courses are not required, as they would not address her concerns. She told me that potentially the GGPs would have been a possibility if there were other family members who could have supported them in the long term and into the future. She said that there were no other family members to take over and this excluded them as appropriate carers for AL. When cross-examined, Ms Steele told me the GGPs have the understanding to bring up AL, they have a suitable home, are in good health and are active for their ages. She accepted that if any grandparent was likely to be successful brining up a baby, it would be these GGPs. She accepted that the GGPs have a stable relationship and that adoption cannot be guaranteed as stable. Ms Steele is of the view that adoption is more likely to provide AL with the long-term care that she requires. Whatever the court�s decision for AL, Ms Steele accepted that the local authority would consider the GGPs having extended periods of holiday contact with MB and PB but that these decisions would be made during the looked after child review process. Ms Steele accepted that AB and LG were cooperating with the Common Assessment Framework that is in place to provide support for their care of L and A. She also accepted that, despite her view that a recent incident of domestic abuse in the relationship between DG and his partner RQ, the local authority is not involved in any safeguarding intervention concerning their children. DG is a maternal uncle of AL and was put forward by GGPs as a support to them and as potential alternative carers for AL in the longer term should the GGPs fall ill and be unable to provide care. During the assessment of the GGPs, the local authority learned that DG had assaulted RQ and caused her a black eye. This incident is said to have started when RQ challenged DG for shouting at their baby. I understand that DG and RQ separated for a short period but have now reconciled. Ms Steele did not accept that it would be appropriate for the GGPs to rely for support on a couple that have domestic violence in their relationship, particularly given that MB, PB and AL suffered significant harm by exposure to the domestic abuse in the relations between their mother and her partners. Ms Steele told me that DG and RQ have not sought to challenge her assessment of them and have not requested any contact with AL. Ms Steele has taken the view that the local authority could not work with DG and RQ as they did not disclose to her the existence of the domestic violence in their relationship. She told me that they were asked directly about domestic abuse and that they lied to her. She does not believe that they can be relied upon to work openly and honestly with the local authority. When cross-examined on behalf of the guardian, Ms Steele relied upon the views expressed by the current foster carers that they, being in their early 50s, were too old to provide long-term care for AL. She also said that the views that she expressed in her assessment about AB had not changed and that AB and LG both have their own needs that lead them to rely on support given to them by the GGPs. My impression of this evidence was that Ms Steele thinks that it is not realistic for AB to be relied upon as a support for GGPs when, in fact, the GGPs have to support her. I then heard evidence from GGF. He has filed a statement dated 11th March 2014, that appears at page B55 of the bundle. In his statement he sets out the relationship that he and his wife had with the children�s mother and how she had, as her lifestyle deteriorated, distanced herself from him. He says that they were not aware of the concerns that the local authority had about the children�s welfare. That statement was not been challenged by the local authority when he gave his oral evidence and, having heard the GGF give his evidence, I am entirely satisfied that had he been aware of the poor parenting that his great-grandchildren were receiving, he would have sought to intervene. In his statement GGF sets out that he and his wife married in 1987. GGM is the step-great grandmother as she is not related by blood to the children in these proceedings but she has known them all their lives, treated them as her own great-grandchildren and they have seen her as their great-grandmother. Throughout this judgment I shall refer to her as the GGM as it is, in my judgment, important to properly reflect the importance of her role in this family and the absence of any genetic connection with these children is entirely immaterial to my decision. GGF is 71 years old, having been born on 6th July 1942. GGM is 69 years old, having been born on 1st July 1944. They are active and in good health. They both belong to a walking club. GGF plays golf 3 times per week. GGM attends the gym twice per week and swims twice per week, once with 2 of the other great-grandchildren. GGF�s mother lived until she was 89 years of age and GGF told me that he has no health difficulties. His mother did suffer from angina so his doctor has recommended that he takes statins as a precautionary measure, although he has not suffered from any heart difficulties himself. He does suffer from arthritis and has had 2 partial knee replacements but he has recovered well and it is clear from observing him in court that he has no mobility difficulties. GGM told me that she has no medical difficulties. She takes medication to maintain good bone density and has occasional IBS but suffers from no medical problems of any significance and she lives a full and active life. At paragraph 11 of his statement at B58, GGF states �we were asked if we could take on all three of the children but given our age we did not believe that we could manage the care of all three of them�. He continues at the next paragraph �it was never suggested to us that we care for AL on her own and had we known at that stage that there was a prospect of her being adopted then of course we would have agreed to take her on�. I listened carefully to GGF�s oral evidence. He does not, in my judgment, underestimate the task that he seeks to persuade me that he is able to take on. MB and PB are older and the impact on them of the harm they suffered in the care of their mother is visible in their behaviour. They require an enhanced level of care to ensure that they reach their full potential. The observations of MB and PB during these proceedings and the recommendations now made by the local authority serve to demonstrate that the GGPs were correct in their assessment that they would not have managed the care of all 3 children. What is striking about the oral evidence that I have heard, is that no party seeks to argue that the GGPs cannot meet all of AL�s needs at this time. In the assessment at C179, Ms Steele states �GGF and GGM at present have no significant health conditions. GGF is currently prescribed preventative medication in respect of his heart and has had two half-knee replacements. GGF and GGM report that they are currently fit and active and feel that they would be able to meet AL�s needs to good standard at this time. The assessment session is evidence that GGF and GGM have a good understanding of the needs of AL and have thought practically about how their lifestyle would change should AL be placed in their care. GGF and GGM are part of AL�s birth family and have a good understanding of her family history. Through the current proceedings, GGF and GGM have gained an understanding of AL�s early life experiences and would be able to promote contact between AL and her siblings and any other appropriate family members. GGM has experience in bereavement counselling and advises that this would assist her in helping AL to understand and deal with her mother's death as she grows older�. Throughout the oral evidence of the GGF, he demonstrated a clear understanding of the needs of AL and of the other children. Many of his answers to the questions put to him were entirely child-focused. An example was where he reviewed his position about the level of contact that he would like with MB and PB. In his answer he said �In practical terms, what it says in the care plan is about right. We had thought about monthly contact but taking into account contact the children will have with their father, whilst we might want to see them more often, it is probably too much for the children�. This answer demonstrated to me that GGF is a man who puts the needs of the children before his own wishes. When he was asked about when he thought L might be able to considered as a support in caring for AL, it was put to him that it would be at least 6 years before she could be relied upon. His response was that he thought it would be longer than that.  Later in his evidence he told me that he expected that AL would have no memory of her mother so he and GGM have started what he described as a memory box for her. This was not done on the advice of the local authority but is something that the GGPs thought that they should do for AL so that she has some things of her mother�s for when she is older and asks questions about her. The GGPs knew her mother well and will be able to answer any questions that she has but GGF said that they have prepared the memory box in case AL is placed away from the family and having a memory box will be very helpful for her in understanding, in real terms, about her mother and birth family. I have heard a significant amount of evidence about the support that the GGPs provide to other members of the family. GGM told me that she has in the past helped AB with the washing and helped her out in the house. Both GGPs help with all of their great-grandchildren. They are seen as the strong people in the family. Strong emotionally, practically and financially. GGF retired aged 50 after 34 years working for British Telecom. He has, in my finding, used much of his time during his retirement to support his family. He has a son who has, from a young age, had special needs and he lives in residential care. The GGPs are committed to continuing to support him by taking him out every 2 or 3 weeks. GGM�s mother is still alive at the age of 92. She lives in residential care but is still very alert and GGM visits her frequently and speaks to her every day. She is committed to maintaining her relationship with and support of her mother. AB�s son, PB, is currently living with GGPs. I have heard that PB left school aged 15 and has lived a nomadic and reclusive lifestyle ever since. He has spent some time with AB but was mainly based at EB�s home. That arrangement broke down when EB�s partner, LH, moved in and PB did not like all the comings and goings that this relationship produced. He left EB�s home and was homeless for a period. The GGPs have taken him in, are trying to get his benefits sorted out so that PB has some money and is able then to look for his own accommodation. I asked AB why Paul was not living with her. Eventually, she said that PB could not live with her as she and LG were on benefits and PB could not live with them if he was not making a financial contribution. I found this answer to be deeply unimpressive, particularly given the evidence that I heard that PB left her care aged 15 and has had to rely on the generosity of others ever since. When GGF and GGM gave their oral evidence, they were both very clear that they would give up their leisure pursuits to ensure that they are able to provide the care that AL will need. I accept what they said to me about this. I also find that they are currently in good health and are able to meet all of AL�s physical and emotional needs. They both drive and have their own cars so the physical moving around that would come with having the care of a young child will be manageable for them. I have taken into account the commitments that GGF and GGM have to other members of the family. GGF told me that if AL was placed with them, he would if necessary, ask PB to leave the home. They both told me that they accepted that they would have to make adjustments to their lifestyles if AL was placed with them and, in my judgment, they are now both clear, if they were not before, that those adjustments may have to include providing less support to AB and LG so that they have enough time, and more importantly energy, to meet the needs of AL should she be placed with them. I am entirely satisfied that the GGPs would make such adjustments to their lifestyles as were necessary to ensure that they were able to meet AL�s needs and I do not approach my assessment of them as potential carers for AL from the basis that they are too overburdened to manage. On the contrary, in my finding they are people with a strong sense of family duty and that is to be applauded. However, they are both wise enough to know that a young baby will require more of their time and attention than the adults that they have supported up until now. Indeed, it might be said that it would be a benefit to the adult members of the family to begin to take more responsibility for themselves and a withdrawal of support by the GGPs would, in my judgment, do them some good. It is clear from what I have said that I find these GGPs to entirely capable and suitable carers for AL save for one issue. That issue is their age. This is addressed by Ms Steele in her assessment of them at C181 where she states �it is accepted at the present time GGF and GGM report no significant health difficulties and are generally fit and well. While this is the case it is likely that they would provide AL with a good level of care. However it must be acknowledged that they are likely to develop age-related health issues within the duration of AL�s childhood and accordingly may not be able to sustain the level of care and interaction that they would intend to provide her with�. At C182, Miss Steele expresses the concern �that should AL be placed with GGM and GGF she is likely to experience a further loss of her primary carer before reaching independence. GGF and GGM have a limited support network which consists of friends in respect of day-to-day support and family members for supporting caring for AL. While they may have appropriate short-term support, there are concerns raised regarding the longer term care of AL��... Without an appropriate support network to take over the care of AL in the event that GGPs are no longer able to meet her needs, it is the view of the local authority that further assessment should not be progressed�.  It was the recommendation of this report, that there be no full parenting assessment undertaken of the GGPs. It is clear from the written evidence of the local authority and from the oral evidence of Miss Steele, that the local authority were not taking an approach that precluded the GGPs as carers based solely on their age. The local authority were prepared to consider AL being placed with GGPs if it was possible for there to be appropriate support and alternative care in place to provide a fairly seamless transition of care when, as is inevitable, the increasing age of the GGPs results in them being unable to provide the care that AL requires.  In the oral evidence that I heard from the Guardian, he took an identical approach. He was not saying that it would be against AL�s best interests for her to be placed with GGPs if the family and friends network was able to provide the care that AL required as the GGPs aged.  It is important to highlight the positions taken by the local authority and the Guardian when considering the case put by the great-grandparents as it demonstrates that the assessment of the great-grandparents was approached with an open mind and, perhaps more importantly, it was not being suggested that the fact that AL would have to experience a transfer of care at some point later in her childhood of itself precluded a placement with these great-grandparents.  So, what of the support plan being put forward by the GGPs? The GGPs were joined as parties to the proceedings on 13 January 2014. They acknowledged that their age may be an inhibitor to their ability to provide for AL into adult life and they proposed that the mother's brother DG and his partner RQ would support them in their care for AL and would become permanent carers in the event that the GGPs were unable to provide care in the future.  DG is 23 years of age and works full time in a business that supplies car parts. RQ is also 23 and she cares for their daughter, E, who was born on 21st October 2010 and is now aged 3 �. RQ is pregnant with her second child, a boy, expected in August of this year. I say her second child as DG has an older daughter, M. DG was unable to give me M�s date of birth, her age or even identify her birthday. Ms Steele met with DG and RQ as part of her assessment of GGPs. She asked about their relationship and specifically asked whether there was any domestic violence and was told that there was not. At page C175, Ms Steele sets out information that she discovered about DG. In summary a referral was made to children's services by the police on 1 October 2010 because DG had been arguing with his mother regarding the sale of a computer console which had become heated. DG had left the area but had then returned and was arrested by the police to prevent a breach of the peace. The recording states that E was present at the time of this altercation. The second issue raised by Ms Steele concerns DG�s father. Prior to her death, EB made allegations that she had been sexually abused by DG�s father. These allegations were discussed with DG and RQ and they entered into a written agreement with the local authority promising not to allow any unsupervised contact between E and DG�s father, even though DG did not believe the allegations to be true. On 25 July 2013 the local authority received a referral from a friend of RQ. The recording at C175 reads as follows: �the request detailed that DG and RQ had separated and RQ could not get him out of the house. It is stated that DG had been violent to RQ on a number of occasions and had given her a blackeye when she had challenged him about telling E to "shut the Fuck up". It was also alleged that DG had been unfaithful to RQ and that she had found messages to a girl that she believed to be aged 14 suggesting that they had had a sexual encounter. At this time RQ was spoken to in an office visit and confirmed this information to be true. RQ advised that she was moving back down south near her family and that the relationship had ended�. In his statement filed for this hearing, GGF states, at �15 on B58 �we were unaware of the extent of the problems in the relationship between DG and RQ. We knew that he had some problems when he was younger but thought that he had outgrown them. We accept that we cannot put him forward as a significant source of support at this stage". When he gave his oral evidence it was clear that GGF was still relying on DG and RQ as a potential source of support and as prospective permanent carers for AL. On that basis, and in furtherance of my inquisitorial function at this hearing. I invited Ms Ledbetter to call DG and RQ as witnesses. When he gave his oral evidence, DG accepted that he had had anger problems and he accepted that he still had difficulty controlling his anger. He said that he had been on an anger management course at school and when he argued with RQ he would leave the house rather that let his temper get the better of him. He was rightly proud of his work record and that he had achieved promotion at work, doubling his income and helping him meet the needs of his growing family. However, I was concerned by his attitude towards the use of violence. He said that he had hit RQ as he had become paranoid that people were talking about him when they were out drinking. It was clear from what he said that, although also drunk, RQ was trying to reassure him that people were not talking about him. DG was not able to accept what was said as reassurance. He saw it as critical as RQ told him to stop being stupid. He punched her in the face with his fist. He said that when he saw her in the morning he felt ashamed and now they talk through their problems and he would never do it again. He told me that he has stopped drinking and that he is prepared to engage in anger management work, although he has not taken any steps to find any therapy himself.  Throughout his evidence he said such things as �she was riling me up� or she was �pushing my buttons�. He even said it was a natural human reaction to lash out. My concern about his minimisation of past events became firmer when he was asked about the events of October 2010 when he did, on the evidence given by AB, assault her during the course of a fight with LL. DG said that he could not remember hitting his mother. He accepted that there were times that he fought with LL but could not recall hitting his mother. I reject that account. I find it inconceivable that any son would not remember hitting his mother, unless there had been a number of occasions when he had used violence towards her. Indeed, AB said in her evidence that DG had hit her when he was a child.  I have reached the conclusion that the use of violence is a feature of how DG manages conflict. It may well be that he has not used violence against RQ a second time. She did not ask him to leave when he did. She only asked him to go when she found out that he had been unfaithful. This does not fill me with confidence that she would end the relationship if he again used violence.  I accept that the local authority has not sought to intervene in DG and RQ�s family life in any way. The local authority has reached the conclusion that they are providing good-enough care to E at this time. However, I share the concerns of Ms Steele and the Guardian that the birth of a new baby will bring additional stresses to the relationship. I do not agree with Ms Ledbetter�s submission that the birth of a new baby is necessarily likely to bring this couple closer together. I hope that it does but the birth of their son with bring a lack of sleep, additional financial demands and may well raise the level of stress beyond that which DG is capable of managing. Ms Ledbetter accepts that this couple have some way to go before they could be considered as appropriate alternative carers for AL. I agree with that assessment. What Ms Ledbetter says is that there is the time for them to make the changes necessary, as it will not be for some time yet that they will be needed as back-up carers for AL. I will return to that submission later. In his oral evidence, GGF also presented LG as a potential support and alternative carer for AL. He did not promote AB as a suitable option but as LG and AB live together in the one home it is, at this time, not realistic to consider them separately, particularly as LG said she has no intention of moving out. In the home of AB, LG resides with her daughter A who is now 3 years old. EB�s eldest daughter, L ,lives at the home under a residence order to AB. L is 11 years old. LG�s care of A has attracted some attention by the family nursing team and a Common Assessment Framework is in place, with the family nurse as the lead professional, to ensure that A�s needs are met and LG is supported in her care for A.  It is right to say that there have been concerns about the condition of the home for some time. There has been a persisting damp problem that has resulted in some rooms becoming uninhabitable. AB told me that she has raised this with the private landlord but repairs have not been made. I asked AB about whether she had any rent arrears. Initially she said there were not but then accepted that there were arrears due to her housing benefit claim not being paid for a period. Given that this is private rented housing, there is no loss of a precious secure social housing tenancy to consider and it is very surprising that AB has allowed such poor conditions to continue rather than taking steps to find and obtain alternative accommodation. I gained a clear understanding of why nothing had been done when I heard about the issue with A sleeping in LG�s bed rather than in her cot. LG was advised by the nurse that A should not sleep with her in the bed. LG�s reason for failing to follow this advice was that the cot was in a damp room and had been damaged by the damp. LG needed an alun key to take the cot apart and move it to another room. In her oral evidence, I was told that it took AB and LG over a month to move the cot from one room to another. I was also told that the house was very cluttered. AB accepts that the house is cluttered and blames L and LG for being hoarders. On a number of occasions she said she needed to sort things out and get old baby clothes or teddy bears moved or sold. What was surprising was the ease with which AB agreed that it would not be appropriate for AL to live with her due to these issues. There was absolutely no hint that AB was motivated to sort out these issues, that in my judgment are easy to address, to enable her to run a case that her granddaughter could be in her care. I found that AB was all to ready to rely on others to do things for her. I could establish no obvious reason why AB could not do her own shopping or tidy her own house. She said she had too many clothes and not enough cupboards and this explained why there were clothes everywhere. If she has too much clutter to provide an appropriate environment for her granddaughter, then she should be getting rid of the �stuff� that is taking up space in the house. None of these task are complicated. The problem, as is seen in many such cases before the court, is that there is a total lack of motivation to do anything that requires any effort. I was told that AB has various health issues and, in her oral evidence, LG listed a number of health problems of her own but neither has any obvious mobility problem. LG accepts that she is able to go out and see friends. Both women have the capability to make changes but they lack the desire to do it. It is my concern that LG has adopted her mother�s approach to life and that anything that requires a bit of effort is avoided. She needs to get out of this bad habit while she can. She is still very young and there will many opportunities that she will miss if she does not change her approach to life. The assessments of AB and LG are clear, and essentially not challenged. I agree with Ms Steele that AB and LG have a co-dependent relationship. I am not persuaded that AB has lived a particularly transient lifestyle or that she has a propensity to form relationships with risky men. There is currently no suggestion that she is in a relationship. My main concern is that if AB or LG are to be seen as supports for GGPs in their care of AL, they will need to show initiative to offer help when it might not have been asked for, the ability to pop round or go out into town when AL or GGPs need them too, the motivation and desire to clean up after AL or the other children and the motivation to attend to absolutely any need that may arise. On the evidence that I have heard and read, and given that AB and LG have shown no motivation to improve their immediate environment, I find it unlikely that they would have the motivation necessary to attend to any needs that the GGPs and AL and have. There is no evidence that AB or LG have offered support to GGPs in the past as this has never been required. However, I accept the local authority�s submission that AB�s answer to a question about what she would do to help GGF telling. She was asked what support she could offer and she said that if GGF needed her he could come and collect her. Placing a further burden on him rather than putting herself out and getting herself over there. As matters stand today, I find that DG and RQ, and, AB and LG are not carers or sources of support that the GGPs could rely upon in assisting to meet AL�s needs. I have considered that the local authority has not thought it necessary to take any action to safeguard L or A or E but for the reasons I have given, both homes have challenges and needs of their own and I am persuaded by the local authority�s submissions that an additional burden on them is not likely to be managed. As I have already said, it is not today that support is required. The GGPs are in perfectly good health and are able to meet AL�s needs. But, that capability is going to diminish. I do not know when it will diminish, whether it will be sudden or whether it would be over a prolonged period but it is certain that there will be a change. Ms Mason fairly accepted that AL may well have 10 years or so in the care of the GGPs before significant changes to the care arrangements have to be made. Both GGF and GGM have seen their own parents age through their 80s. Whilst GGF said that his mother wallowed in her ill health, I don�t believe that either GGF or GGM would expect to be caring for AL though into their mid to late 80s. AL care needs will change as she gets older and into her teenage years, and whilst the needs of an older child may be less physically demanding, she is in my judgment likely to have needs such as help with her education, help with technology, advice on relationships, transportation to and from activities and other such matters that some, will by then, be beyond the capabilities of the GGPs. It is for this reason that the identification of alternative care and sources of support is so important. There is a one important dispute between the 2 sides of this case that I have not yet mentioned. It is the submission of the local authority and of the guardian that, although I might reach a conclusion that the GGPs are thoroughly reliable people, I must not determine this case on the basis that they can be trusted to make appropriate arrangements for AL at the time that alternative care is required.  When the Guardian gave his oral evidence, he listened carefully to the questions put to him and carefully considered his responses. He was in no way dogmatic and he accepted the pros and cons of each option. He told me that he thought that the GGPs will be unable to look after AL or AL may have to look after them. He said that AL has the opportunity to be placed with carers who can properly and fully meet her needs through her childhood and beyond and this is overwhelmingly in her best interests. Concerning the proposal made by the GGPs, the Guardian said that �AL would experience predictable further losses and disruption and there is considerable uncertainty about what her future life would be�. I accept that there is uncertainty about her future life and that she will suffer predictable losses but uncertainty and loss are features of both of the competing cases that are put before me. The advocates have referred me to a number of authorities as providing guidance in how I should approach my decision-making in this case. I have been referred to Re BS (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146. In quoting from Re C and B [2001] 1 FLR 611, the judgment in BS states �intervention in the family may be appropriate, but the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that, and the effort should be devoted towards that end. Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child or children and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child". The judgment continues to quote from YC v UK [2012] 55 EHRR 967 at para 134 and states �family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and��. everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to rebuild the family. It is not enough to show that the child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing". When referring to the judgement of Supreme Court in Re B, the President says �the language used in Re B is striking. Different words and phrases are used but the message is clear. Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption - care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are �a very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do", where "no other course is possible in the child's interests", they are "the most extreme option", a "last resort when all else fails", to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child�s welfare, in short, where nothing else will do". At paragraph 27 of Re BS, the President states �the court must consider all the options before coming to a decision. As Lady Hale said (paragraph 198) it is necessary to explore and attempt alternative solutions. What are these options? That will depend upon the circumstances of the particular cases. They range, in principle, from the making of no order at one end of the spectrum to making an adoption order at the other. In between, there may be orders providing for the return of the child to the parent�s care with the support of the family assistance order or subject to a supervision order or a care order; or the child may be placed with relatives under a residence order or special guardianship order or in a foster placement and a care order; or the child may be placed with someone else, again under a residence order or special guardianship order or in a foster placement under the care order. This is not an exhaustive list of the possibilities; wardship is another, as are placements in specialist residential or healthcare settings. Yet it can be seen that the possible list of options is long." One of the requirements of the judgment in BS is for the local authority to provide the court with proper evidence that addresses all the options that are realistically possible as an outcome in the proceedings. This judgment has led to local authorities and guardians presenting what is often called a �balance sheet� of the advantages and disadvantages to the child of each placement option. I have carefully considered the analyses provided by the social worker and the guardian in their written evidence. I have carefully noted the analysis provided by Ms Steele in her oral evidence and the contrary views outlined by the advocates for the family in their oral submissions. I have read all the papers in volume 1 of the court bundle and those documents in volume 2 that have been drawn to my attention. In the case of Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, Lord Justice McFarlane, at paragraph 49 stated "in most childcare cases a choice will fall be made between two or more options. The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most Draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most Draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option. The linear approach, in my view, is not apt where the judicial exercise is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for child�s future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare�. In Re C (A child)(care and placement order: special guardianship order) [2013] EWCA Civ 1257, McFarlane LJ stated, at paragraph 29. �Where the court is seized of both an application for a care order an application for a placement for adoption order, I would question the wisdom, when making a care order in the middle of the process of evaluating the ultimate question of whether or not a placement for adoption order is to be made, of "approving a care plan for adoption" by reference only to the Children Act 1989 section 1 welfare provisions. In common with the practice of many family judges, that was the course taken by the judge in the present case. It is however a practice which may inadvertently lead the court away from engaging with the proper, holistic evaluation of the central welfare question and, where placement for adoption is an issue, doing so within the structure of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 section 1 rather than the Children Act 1989 section 1. Any judge, who is aware that (either at the current hearing or at a hearing shortly thereafter), he or she is going to be considering whether or not to make a placement for adoption order, would be wise only to approve the care plan for adoption where such a plan seems likely to meet the welfare requirements of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 section 1 and section 52. Miss Mason has referred me to the case of W and H [2013] EWCA Civ 1177. The passage that she relies upon from this decision places the same emphasis on the welfare checklist in the Adoption and Children Act 2002 as being the appropriate factors for me to consider when deciding AL�s future care. I have also been provided with a copy of Re C (Family Placement) [2009] EWCA Civ 72. I'm very grateful to Miss McCallum who has produced this authority in line with her duty to bring all relevant matters to the attention of the court, even though this decision could be seen as supporting a position that is contrary to the position taken by her client. This case concerns an appeal from a decision of His Honour Judge O'Dwyer when the learned judge made a residence order concerning a five-year-old child to the 70-year-old grandmother. At paragraph 17, Wilson LJ, as he was then, said �fundamentally, this appeal turns upon the age of the grandmother and the likelihood that, irrespective of whether she remains alive for the next 13 years, she will prove incapable, at any rate towards the end of that period, of caring satisfactorily for J�. In this case there was criticism by the Guardian that the judge had been irresponsible to have left the plan for the child sketched out only in the barest outline by "reference to the likely presence, somewhere or other, of the aunt, of the grandmothers other two children and the grandmother's various other grandchildren�. It is clear from the decision the learning trial judge was impressed by the substantial wider family in terms of its cohesiveness and commitment to the child. At paragraph 19, Wilson LJ states that there is no doubt that it is very unusual to consider it appropriate to commit a five-year-old child to the permanent care of a 70 year old grandmother. However within this decision the Court of Appeal accepted that there was some support by one expert witness in the case for the grandmother to provide care for this child and that the judge had given reasons why he disagreed with the recommendations of the children's Guardian and the other experts. I remind myself that the decision in this case is a matter for me and I am at liberty to disagree with the recommendations of the local authority and the Guardian but I must have good reason for disagreeing and clearly express my reasons if I do. I take into account all the legal principles I have outlined in the paragraphs above. I treat AL�s welfare as my paramount consideration and I have regard to the principal that any delay in decision-making for AL is likely to be contrary to her best interests. Any order I make will be an interference with the right to private and family life of AL and one or other of her family members depending on the decision that I make. I should only interfere in the right to family life if that interference is prescribed in domestic law, pursues a legitimate aim, is necessary in a democratic society and is a proportionate step to take in the pursuit of that aim. There are clear advantages for AL in the plan presented by the local authority. She would be placed with carers who have been assessed as able to meet a child of AL�s age and will be specifically matched to her needs. She will, if adopted, become a full member of her new family and have security with them throughout her childhood and into her adult life. She would not experience another predictable loss of her main care giver and attachment figure. It is her best interests throughout her life that I have to consider and adoption provides for her the best chance of reliable long-term care. However, adoption has a number of significant disadvantages. It severs AL�s legal ties with her birth family. Her brother and sisters are no longer, in law, her brothers and sisters. If adopted she will be placed with carers who have no direct knowledge of her mother. AL will learn of her mother's death and will have questions about her. Adopters will not be best placed to answer these questions. Although the local authority's plan is for there to be some direct contact, the local authority falls short of making it a requirement of matching that prospective adopters facilitate direct contact with family members. The local authority anticipate that adopters will find direct contact with the siblings and GGPs less threatening than direct contact with a parent and I have expressed my view that the local authority should be optimistic that they will find adopters prepared to support this important contact between AL and her siblings. That said, it is not guaranteed. A further disadvantage of adoption is that contact once per year is no substitute for growing up having everyday experience of your brother and sisters. The advantages of the plan put forward by the GGPs are that it provides for all the matters that I have set out as being disadvantages in the plan for adoption. AL would remain within her birth family. She would retain full knowledge of her siblings, uncles and aunts, grandmother and cousins. She will have the benefit of the excellent care that would be provided for her by the GGPs. I was very impressed with both GGF and GGM. They have a lot to offer AL and it would be a significant loss for AL to be denied the chance of experiencing a close relationship with them. However, there are very real disadvantages in the plan presented by the GGPs. AL would grow in the care of the GGPs, watching them age and knowing that ultimately she will have to look elsewhere to have her long-term care needs met. I share the concern expressed by Ms Steele in her assessment that AL may find herself acting as a carer for the GGPs, not that she is required by them to do this but because she feels a duty to do so. I am sure that if she grew up in the care of this great-grandfather she would share his sense of family duty and would want to do the best by them.    Conclusions and Orders  It is clear to me that this case is not just about age. I accept that had an appropriate support package been possible from the family resources available, that Miss Steele saw such positive attributes to the care that could be provided by the GGPs, that the local authority would have been open to supporting an unusual outcome of placing a one-year-old child in the care of the 71-year-old great-grandfather and a 69 year old great grandmother. This has been a very finely balanced decision. I do not share the Guardian�s certainty that the right decision for AL in this case is so clear. There are substantial disadvantages to AL in both of the options presented to me. I have carefully considered whether I should leave decisions about finding care for AL in the future to the GGPs. As I have already said, I am impressed with them and I know that they would want to do their very best. I am to look into the future as to what I consider to be best for AL. Looking at the package that the GGPs have been able to put forward today, given what is at stake in these proceedings, does not give me confidence that the GGPs would be able to find anything better in the future. I accept that needs and circumstances change but I have to make a decision for AL today that will have life-long consequences for her. To do that, I need to have some confidence in the extended family. I do not have that confidence. My confidence in the GGPs is not enough. I simply do not know and cannot predict what would happen to AL. The absence of any predictable plan and the unavailability of suitable alternative care has led me to conclude that AL�s welfare throughout her life will be best met by her placement for adoption. This is, in my judgment, the proportionate response to her need to have reliable, constituent and long-term care. I have considered all the factors in the welfare checklist in the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002. I have considered the proposals for contact set out in AL�s care plan. These are not opposed by any party and I am satisfied that they meet AL�s need to have some on-going experience of her siblings and GGPs. I am also satisfied that the provisions of the care plans for MB and PB are appropriate and that the plans for contact meet their needs. I make MB, PB and AL the subjects of full care orders to Leeds City Council. The 2nd application before the court is for a placement order concerning AL. In considering this application, I have regard to section 1(2) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. AL�s welfare throughout her life is my paramount consideration. I have considered all the factors set out in section 1(4) of the ACA 2002 and particularly the effect on AL of ceasing to be a member of her birth family and becoming an adopted person and section 1(f), her relationships with relatives, the likelihood of these continuing, their ability to provide her with a secure environment and their wishes and feelings. I have come to the conclusion that there are no family members that are able to provide the long-term care for AL that she needs. The contact arrangements that I have approved in the care plan will provide a link with the birth family that will enable AL to have direct contact with her siblings and to benefit from direct experience of her GGPs. AL requires permanent carers for the rest of her childhood and a family life with them for the rest of her life. It will be a loss for her to lose her family of origin but I have reached the conclusion that adoption is the best option for AL and that this loss is outweighed by the benefits that a �forever family� will bring. LL does not consent to the placement order. I have considered section 52 ACA 2002. I am satisfied that AL�s welfare requires that consent be dispensed with and I dispense with the consent of LL and, having considered and approved the proposals for contact, make a order authorizing Leeds City Council to place AL for adoption.    Recorder Howe 17th April 2014

HHJ
CLEARY: 

 

1.                 
VH was born
on 17th June 2013.� His mother is NH (N); his father is JW; and his
maternal aunt is KH.� In addition to those three blood relatives, to whom I
shall refer by their first names, the mother began a relationship with GD (G)
following V�s birth.� On 13th September 2013 paramedics were called
to the flat where G and N were then living with V.� The infant was in a very
poor state and appeared to have suffered a significant seizure.� He was
medicated by the ambulance crew and taken immediately to hospital where he made
a swift recovery.� In accordance with protocol he was fully examined and, on
that day and over the ensuing days, a number of investigations revealed that he
had suffered bleeds over his brain.� Additionally, as is normal, a full
skeletal survey was carried out and the resulting radiographs by CT scan and
MRI imaging revealed that he had sustained fractures to each leg and his left
arm.� A small bruise was found above his right clavicle with all the appearance
and size of a fingertip.� V�s presentation was strongly indicative of
non-accidental injury and the hospital engaged in the appropriate child
protection procedures.� The local authority was informed and in short order
childcare proceedings were brought.�� 

2.                 
My task in
this judgment is to address two issues: first, to establish whether the
injuries which were revealed by the hospital examination were likely to be
non-accidental; secondly, if they were, is the court able to identify the
likely perpetrator?� Those two questions have in fact been broken down in the
following way.� The questions are subdivided thus: what injuries did V suffer?�
Are they what is commonly termed non-accidental?� When is it likely he suffered
those injuries?� Who is the likely perpetrator of those injuries?� In the event
of the identification of a perpetrator, did any other member of the pool of perpetrators
fail to protect V?� I shall address my task in that order.

3.                 
To assist me
I have received evidence from three eminent clinicians.� They have had access
to all the appropriate case papers and also to the reports of the treating
clinicians at the hospital.� I have also received oral evidence from two of
those latter clinicians, Dr Shalala and Dr McLachlan.� I have had a good deal
of paperwork put before me in four large Lever Arch files.� Within those files
I have had access to the medical notes of the treating physicians whom I have
identified together with an agreed minute of a helpful meeting between all
three of the expert clinicians who gave oral evidence.� I also have an entire
Lever Arch file of police interviews of N, G and K and three further lay
witnesses who gave oral evidence in the second week of the case.� I have also
read the statements of N and G, who each put two statements before the court in
response to directions.� As will become clear, in addition to the filed
statements I received further statements, two in manuscript and one in typeset
from witnesses who were called late in the day.� From time to time I have been
referred to a good number of other individual documents, which I might not
identify in this judgment, but which nonetheless remain in my mind as I respond
to the questions which require my decisions.� Receipt and attention to all that
I have described has accounted for no less than 80 pages of closely typed notes
on my laptop.

4.                 
I turn
briefly to the law which governs this chapter of the case.� By direction of the
Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33 I am required to adopt the civil
standard of proof. Thus the local authority which brings the case before me and
on whose shoulders the burden of proof remains must satisfy me that as I
proceed through the questions which I have identified, that its case in each
area is made out on the balance of probability, what therefore is more likely
than not.� By the same token I am required not to leave things hanging in the
air.� If the assertion, whatever it might be, is not made out then I am
required to reject it.� Either the case is made out to the required standard or
it is not.

5.                 
The first
question: the nature of the injuries which were discovered.� V arrived at
hospital at 10.30 in the morning where he was seen by a registrar, Dr Rauf.�
Having been medicated by the paramedics, he appeared calm and was breathing
spontaneously.� In the mid-afternoon of that same day he was seen on the
paediatric ward by a doctor, who noted a small bruise over his right upper
chest.� A CT scan was undertaken and described in the report of the treating
radiologist, Dr Shalala, as bilateral, sizeable, chronic subdural haematomas.�
That clinician reported that the scan revealed bleeding over the brain on
either side.� Both haemorrhages, he said, were chronic.� Neurosurgical
intervention, however, was not required.� An ophthalmic review showed that
there were no retinal haemorrhages.� 

6.                 
On Monday, 16th
September a full skeletal survey was carried out.� This revealed a corner
fracture on the medial aspect of the left distal femur; that is, the left
thighbone had suffered a chip off the corner on the inner aspect of the bone at
the knee end.� A similar break was suspected at the outer aspect of the right
thigh, again at the knee end.� A third fracture was observed at the right
proximal tibia.� However, the hospital radiographer did not detect that which
was subsequently observed by Dr Chapman, consultant paediatric radiologist and
paediatric neuroradiologist, who received joint instructions from all parties
and reported to the court on 13th December.� On observing the
subsequent chest X-ray dated 4th October he had noted an additional
fracture, this to the left proximal humerus, just below the left shoulder.� He
was to explain in his report that up to 50% of such fractures are not evident
on X-ray, because the fracture may be incomplete or is seen through a curved
structure on the film.� Each of those fractures � that is to the legs and to
the arm � are described as metaphyseal fractures and are explained in the
report of Dr Chapman as being the result of a pulling or twisting force applied
to the limb.� Thus V had sustained injury to five areas of his body: his brain,
his left arm, his upper right chest and each leg.

7.                 
The discovery
and identity of the injuries.� As soon as Dr Shalala saw the CT scan he
suspected that the presentation was indicative of non-accidental injury.� He
alerted Dr McLachlan, the named doctor for child protection in the local
authority area and a paediatrician herself.� In her report of 19th
September she recorded the injuries and concurred with the view that V�s
seizure, which had caused his mother and G to contact the ambulance service in
the first instance, was likely to have been caused by the subdural haemorrhages
which had been noted on the CT scan.� She was unable to form an opinion on
whether or not those haemorrhages were caused by an acute inflicted head injury
or whether they were caused by a previously inflicted head injury causing bleeding
and subsequent irritation of the brain.� It was her view that there had been
two different bleeds around the brain caused by very significant,
non-accidental, injury on at least two occasions.� She was unable, she wrote in
her report of 19th September, three days after admission, at G509 to
form a view on the likely age of the broken thighbone - at that stage she only
knew of one leg injury - and/or of the age of the bleeds around the brain.�
However, she was of the view that those three injuries occurred on two or three
separate occasions.� There was no doubt in her mind but that those injuries and
the bruise to the child�s chest were non-accidental in origin.� 

8.                 
I should say
at this stage that all parties to this unhappy case concur with that opinion.�
Dr McLachlan admitted that it was beyond her expertise to comment on ageing and
indeed she was not a radiologist.� Dr Shalala, although a radiologist, is not a
paediatric radiologist.� Thus the court accepted an application by all parties
that there be joint instructions to the three eminent clinicians of whom I have
spoken: Dr Chapman, consultant paediatric radiologist and paediatric
neuroradiologist at Birmingham Children�s Hospital, an expert of national
reputation with especial interest in the radiology of non-accidental injury in
a department which undertakes about 60,000 imaging investigations on children
each year, including approximately 3,500 CT scans and 12,000 MRI scans; Dr
Stoodley, consultant neuroradiologist in practice at a number of hospitals and
in particular the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, again with a nationally
recognised area of expertise in the interpretation of imaging investigations of
the brain and spinal chord, with a specific interest in the neuroimaging of
children; and Dr Morrell, consultant paediatrician with particular expertise
and experience in childhood neuro-disabilities.� 

9.                 
Each expert
submitted their respective reports in December of last year.� On 7th
March of this year they attended a joint meeting.� The meeting addressed the
nature of the injuries and the experts attended this hearing to be questioned
upon their respective reports and upon their conclusions set out in the agreed
note of their meeting.� I shall first address the respective injury sites.

10.             
The presentation
of the brain injury. Given the report arising from the initial CT scan and the
assumptions made by Dr McLachlan, Dr Stoodley was questioned as to the nature
of the subdural bleeding.� In simple terms was it acute?� Or was there evidence
of an earlier chronic bleed with a further acute subdural bleed?� Again in
simple terms both he and Dr Shalala accepted that the brighter the appearance
of blood on the scans the more recent the haemorrhage.� He was to accept that
in terms of the appearance on the scan there were two possible explanations,
either that darker fluid which was observable on the scan represented older
subdural blood � that is blood which had been bright, but had become
progressively darker with age and could be identified as chronic subdural haematomas
� or it revealed collections of dark matter representing acute traumatic
effusions.� He took the view, which he maintained in his evidence under
cross-examination before me, that the latter explanation was to be preferred.�
He justified his view by the absence of membrane formation within the
collections, formations which were not detected either by the CT scan or the
more sensitive MRI scan; so also he found that the collections had increased in
size between the initial CT scan and the subsequent MRI scan, which again
pointed towards acute traumatic effusions rather than chronic haematoma.�
Finally, as we shall see from the observations recorded by N and G, there had
been nothing to indicate a disturbance of V�s brain function; that is, there had
been no previous seizure or worrying behaviour which might suggest a previous
episode of significant subdural bleeding, which might indicate an earlier
injury leading to a bleed.� This expert accepted that the appearance of bright
blood would indicate an acute bleed and that ageing � that is from an earlier
insult � would result in a darkening of the fluid.� However, as became plain
during his evidence, that was not the only fluid which had escaped in the
subarachnoid space for cerebrospinal fluid was also present.� To the naked eye
that fluid is clear, but on radiographs it presents as black.� Consequently,
the presence of both fluids in one collection can, to use a non-clinical term,
result in the presentation of a misleadingly dark appearance.� Dr Stoodley
concluded that the effusions as pictured on both scans were acute.� They were
found on either side of the brain and at the rear, the posterior.� He was
perfectly satisfied that they had occurred on one occasion and were not
indicative of chronic bleeds.

11.             
The evidence
of Dr Shalala where it conflicted with that of Dr Stoodley was not persuasive.�
He found it difficult to accept, for example, that he saw much, if any, bright
blood on the scans.� He accepted there was no evidence of loculation, which is
perhaps better described in lay terms as compartmentalisation, of the
collections which were revealed by the scans.� He went so far as to suggest
that such brightness as did exist was explained by the reflection from the rim
of the dura, a suggestion which was politely but firmly rejected by Dr
Stoodley.� He also accepted that there was no sign of methaemoglobin, which one
would expect to see if acute blood had been present for any significant length
of time, and there was no sedimentation, which usually appears during the
haematoma�s sub-acute phase, between 72 hours and two weeks.� Dr Shalala was
candid enough to accept that he has a far greater experience of imaging
following trauma to the adult brain and that his practice was to ensure that
paediatric examinations were historically, and indeed currently, referred by
his hospital to the children�s hospital in Birmingham.� At the stand he
abandoned his opinion as expressed in his brief report, a document which
extends to no more than a dozen or so lines, that the imaging revealed chronic
haemorrhages and he deferred to Dr Stoodley.

12.             
Dr Morrell
supported the view of his colleague that there was no evidence of
encephalopathic injury prior to the morning of the admission of V to hospital
and he agreed with the conclusion that the presentation of the brain injury was
suggestive of one recent injury.

13.             
The
observation of lay witnesses plays a part in establishing whether or not and
when an injury to the brain had occurred.� Neither N nor G had given a history
of accidental head trauma of sufficient severity to account for the appearances
of subdural bleeding.� While impact injury can, Dr Morrell conceded, give rise
to subdural bleeding, acute subdural bleeding is usually seen at a single site
and not, as here, at several different sites.� There is no explanation which
would account for the pattern of acute bleeding found by Dr Stoodley and
conceded by Dr Shalala.� The evidence of those closest to V in the hours and
days leading up to his seizure did not indicate any earlier insult which had
been responsible for the existence of chronic haematomas.� Were that to have
occurred and had there been an injury to the brain, then the significant
symptoms which would follow and follow quickly would have been observable to
the uninformed bystander or parent.� Thus, as Dr Morrell deposed, there would
have been an immediate and obvious decrease in consciousness, reduction in
heart rate and a rise in blood pressure.� All the descriptions at the stand
indicated that although V might have been unsettled, his discomfort was not of
any great moment.

14.             
Some time was
spent, both in the expert meeting and under cross-examination, on the issue of
V�s head circumference.� The circumference had increased in size very
significantly over the infant�s short lifespan, moving through the centiles at
a very significant rate.� However, Dr Morrell considered that this was a
pattern which was sometimes seen in young babies and in any event was running
in parallel with his overall body development.� Measurements had been taken at
birth, at two weeks and then 11 weeks.� It will be remembered that the baby was
almost exactly three months, that is 13 weeks, old when he was presented to
hospital.� The circumference was then measured and was found to have increased
to just below the 91st centile.� However, Dr Morrell was reassured
both by the baby�s general development, which as I say has paralleled his
circumference development, and by the absence of other clinical indications
that the infant had come to any harm.� He anticipated in any event that a good
deal of the enlargement of the skull, bearing in mind that at that age the
skull is not set and is elastic and is equipped to expand as a baby grows, was
very probably due to the bleeds into the intracranial space.� To put it simply,
the skull had expanded to accommodate the fluid, avoiding pressure on the brain
itself.

15.             
I shall come
in due course to the suggestion by counsel for G during the presentation of the
lay evidence, which was not shared by all those who had had direct contact with
V during the first month of his life, in cross-examination of Dr Stoodley that
his crying might have been symptomatic of brain irritation.� It will be seen
that I reject that suggestion, just as none of the experts accepted that there
was any indication of earlier brain injury.� As Dr Morrell said in evidence, a
shrill cry is common to babies with brain damage, but there will be evidence of
brain damage, for example developing meningitis.� There would have to be
evidence of continuing damage, damage which does not appear on the CT scan or
MRI scan.� 

16.             
At this stage
of the exercise it is pertinent to remind myself of the oral evidence of each
of the experts at the stand.� In the case of Dr Morrell the radiological
picture � that is the brief report to which he then had access, that being the
observations of Dr Shalala � had been that the bleeds were chronic, �but I was
suspicious that his symptoms on 13th September arose from an acute
event.�� There was nothing in the clinical history which related to a brain
injury or encephalopathy.� Dr Morrell was to be shown in due course the report
of Dr Stoodley after his own had been submitted and with that report and the
view as to the timing and presentation of the injury as an acute occurrence he agreed.�
He went on:��������������� 

�Whatever neurological insult occurred happened within
hours of admission, had there been hypoxic ischaemic damage there would have
been continuing symptoms, which did not present themselves; so also a build-up
of fluid in a subdural haematoma.� It is probable,� he said, �the insult
occurred within minutes of the collapse.� The seizure was indicative of an
acute brain injury.�

 

����������� In
response to a suggestion of a previous injury and a re-bleed, his response was
simple and to the point.� �I have not encountered symptoms as severe as these
in the context of a re-bleed.�

17.             
Turning to Dr
Stoodley, he deposed:

�The
acute bleeding has not come from re-bleeding.� The acute blood and effusions
have come from a single recent event.�

 

����������� He
described the child�s clinical presentation, respiratory collapse, fitting, and
dramatic change, and he maintained under successive cross-examination from
counsel that the head injury can be explained as a single, acute, recent
event.� �There is no evidence of older incidents of significant subdural bleed
and�, he went on, �the symptoms were caused by the direct injury to the brain.�

18.             
The cause.�
The mechanism of injury, in Dr Stoodley�s view, is likely to have involved
shaking, producing a backward and forward movement of the unsupported baby�s
head, pivoting at the neck.� This will have caused rotation of the brain within
the skull, leading to stretching of the subdural veins crossing the subdural
space, leading then to the bleeds.� All the experts agree that the presentation
does not enable the court to conclude that the injury arose from an impact.� A
blow to the head would cause bleeding, but at the site of the impact, whereas
the bleeds in V�s case are multiple and on three sides of the brain � in inelegant
and non-clinical terms, to each side and the back of the head.� When challenged
directly as to the mechanism Dr Stoodley responded that throwing would not
replicate a shaking event.� That would produce an impact injury.� Dr Morrell
excluded any organic process or disease which might have caused the bleeds, an
opinion shared by Dr Stoodley.� 

19.             
Given that Dr
Shalala changed his mind and deferred to Dr Stoodley and given the consensus of
the experts� meeting and the quality of the expert evidence at the witness
stand, which withstood the closest cross-examination, I am quite satisfied that
on the balance of probability and indeed with a significant degree of certainty
that the bleeds over the brain were indicators of one acute injury.

20.             
The limb
fractures.� I remind myself that we see from Dr Chapman�s analysis of the
skeletal survey that there is a metaphyseal fracture of the left proximal
humerus � that is the left arm � just below the left shoulder.� There is a
similar fracture to the left distal femur � that is the thighbone � just above
the knee and also to the right distal femur and the right proximal tibia, which
is the upper end of the shinbone on either side of the knee.� Dr Chapman
referred in his evidence to other terms for metaphyseal fractures. �They are
also known as corner fractures or bucket handle fractures.� They refer to an
injury to the metaphysis, which is a growing plate at each end of each long
bone such as a tibia or femur etc.� In the case of an infant � that is a child
under the age of one year � the metaphysis is not actually bone, but is more
akin to a piece of cartilage and only fully ossifies when the body and the
skeleton become mature.� Dr Chapman was not challenged as to the presence of
any of these fractures.

21.             
The cause.�
Such fractures cannot be caused by a non-ambulant infant to itself.� The cause
therefore is external and inflicted by a third party.� I shall deal more fully
with the mechanics when I address the next question.

22.             
Meanwhile,
the bruise.� It may be easy to overlook this injury, but it was significant
enough for Dr McLachlan to record it in her report and indeed it is discussed
also in the experts� meeting and in the report of Dr Morrell.� The bruise over
the clavicle is in an unusual place.� It is likely, in Dr Morrell�s view, to
have been caused by firm pressure, probably with the fingers, given the small
circumference.� The fact remains that the child sustained a haematoma on his
upper torso and the suggestion by either N or G that it could have been closed
by the placing of the sticky holders of the electrical connections to the
hospital monitoring equipment was clearly fanciful.

23.             
This leads me
to the next question on the menu which I have constructed.� The experts agreed
it is in an unusual place and cannot easily or indeed at all be explained by
CPR given its positioning.� 

24.             
Are the
injuries non-accidental in nature?� It has been conceded by all the respondents
to the case brought by the local authority that they are not.� I do not propose
in this judgment to embark on a discussion as to the limitation or inadequacies
of language which have grown up around the term �non-accidental.�� I
acknowledge that it is unsatisfactory for a court to be faced with a binary
choice in such limited form.� There must, as I think has been acknowledged
within the Division, be a spectrum of insults to which an infant is exposed
ranging from accidental through unintentional to reckless and then to abusive
and then to intentional.� I will endeavour in this judgment to confine myself
to answering the question in this way.� Can the injuries which V suffered be
explained as accidental?� If not, then as a matter of logic they will be
classified as non-accidental.

25.             
Turning
therefore in similar order to the injuries which have been identified, the
brain injury.� The summary by Dr Morrell in his overview at E58 gives a very
clear analysis of the traumatic causes of subdural haematomas.� He gives a very
helpful analysis of the occurrence of bleeds at birth and, as a result, of
accidental trauma in infancy.� Whereas a substantial proportion of babies born
by normal delivery do have subdural haematomas (for they are seen on brain
scans after birth), they are small and all have resolved by three months after
birth.� There are no recorded cases of those haematomas developing or expanding
into larger, chronic subdural haematomas.� Baby V was almost exactly three
months when he was admitted to hospital.� It is unlikely, in his unchallenged
opinion on this issue, that the images on the CT scan or MRI scan could date
back to his birth.� Accidental injury was rejected by Dr Morrell.

26.             
N and G
referred to a possible injury to his brain when the baby might have bumped his
head on the edge of his pushchair and G spoke of some sort of roll on the sofa
when the infant descended a very short distance, measured presumably in inches,
into a fold between the sofa cushions.� Dr Morrell dismisses the reported
episodes as having insufficient force to cause or exacerbate subdural
haematomas.

27.             
He moves then
to the research and history of cases involving non-accidental injury and his
maintained view is that the mechanism is a shaking injury, a description which
I have already mentioned when addressing in part the remarks of Dr Stoodley.�
Both experts agree that the subdural haematomas which are seen in
non-accidental injury are usually multi-focal; that is that the bleeding occurs
in different parts of the brain and commonly also found in the posterior fossa
of the brain.� Both experts acknowledge that there were no retinal haemorrhages
found in the ophthalmic examination of the baby and while both acknowledge that
retinal haemorrhages are often associated with shaking injuries, the absence of
retinal haemorrhages is indicative only of the likelihood that the insult to V
was at the lower end of severity.� Dr Stoodley was firm in his presentation of
evidence and at the experts� meeting.� He reported that the investigation and
tests have not shown evidence of any naturally occurring medical condition
which might reasonably account for V�s clinical presentation - that is, his
seizures on the morning of 13th September when N and G observed that
he appeared to have stopped breathing and that he had become rigid - or the
appearances on the scans.� He agreed with Dr Morrell that there is no history
of accidental head trauma of sufficient severity to account for either, and all
of the features seen on the scans are well recognised and well reported in
cases of non-accidental head injury involving shaking mechanisms.� On balance
both clinicians believe that the intracranial abnormalities have been caused by
shaking; that is by a non-accidental mechanism.� With those opinions I
respectfully agree.

28.             
The
metaphyseal fractures.� The mechanism for these injuries is described by Dr
Chapman as being pulling and/or twisting forces applied to the limb beyond
rough handling.� V was non-ambulant and was incapable of inflicting these
injuries on himself.� In simple terms the doctor described these fractures as
being invariably the result of a good �yank� rather than any direct force or
fall.� The amount of force needed is not known, given that logically
experimentation on babies is not possible, but even really rough handling
would, this expert attested, be insufficient.� 

29.             
In his report
at E53 Dr Morrell again gives a helpful overview of the possible causes of
these bony injuries.� He reports that the classical metaphyseal corner fracture
is one of the more specific features seen in child abuse and is seen rarely in
accidental form.� Classic metaphyseal lesions are seen most frequently in the
areas in which fractures have been found in V�s skeletal survey.� He agreed
with Dr Chapman that the mechanism of causation is traction or twisting and
pulling.� Both clinicians mentioned that it is possible to exert these forces
by shaking in that fractures can occur if the limbs flail about while shaking
takes place.� However, both Dr Morrell and Dr Chapman were satisfied that it is
most likely that the fractures seen on V�s skeletal survey are the result of
pulling and twisting forces.� In Dr Morrell�s report from pages E54 through E60
he addresses and rejects any genetic explanation for the injuries revealed by
the scans and the skeletal survey.� He was not challenged at the witness stand
as to these findings and indeed none of the experts were deflected from their
view expressed in their experts� meeting and in their reports that V was likely
to have suffered non-accidental injury to his legs and his arm.� Little, if
any, argument was presented to the experts as to the existence and probable
cause of the injuries to the baby�s limbs.� The experts maintained their
expressed and agreed views.� 

30.             
Given the
quality of their respective reports and my assessment of their responses to
questions from the Bar, I conclude that their expert evidence cannot be
usefully challenged.� It is probable � and again I use the civil standard of
proof � that the fractures were non-accidental.� Again my conclusion rests very
high on the scale of probability.

31.             
The
bruising.� On admission to hospital there was no mention of the bruise on V�s
upper chest on the admission forms.� It is first described that afternoon when
it appears that it was� noted at 2.35 p.m. It is entirely probable that before
that time, the bruise would have been developing and is likely not to have been
noticeable when he was first admitted to hospital.� As I have said, the cause
of the bruise in that comparatively unusual area is likely, in the opinion of
Dr Morrell, to have been either firm pressure or a blow.� It is unlikely to have
been inflicted by an ECG sticker.� The presence of the bruise is wholly
unexplained and no history has been given by either G or N which could explain
it.� As before, there is no genetic explanation for its presence.� In my
judgment, since the baby certainly could not have inflicted the bruise on himself
and since it is unlikely that it could have been inflicted in hospital, then in
the absence of explanation it is non-accidental.

32.             
The timing of
the brain injury.� Dr Stoodley made a helpful contribution to the March meeting
with these comments:

�Assuming that the court accepts
that the darker subdural fluid is traumatic effusion rather than chronic
subdural haematoma and that all the subdural abnormalities occurred at the same
time, the timing of the shaking event is best assessed on the basis of the
clinical features of the case.� It is likely that there would have been a
change in behaviour at the time of the causative event.� The infant would not
have behaved normally after the causative event, which is likely therefore to
have occurred after the last time the court is able to find as a fact on the
basis of the factual evidence that he was behaving neurologically within the
bounds of normality.��� 

 

����������� He
went on to say that there would have been an obvious change in his neurological
behaviour at the time of the causative event.� 

33.             
Dr Morrell
was clear, both from what Dr Stoodley said and from his own reading of the
papers, there was no evidence that he could find of any encephalopathic injury
prior to the morning of the admission at hospital.� Dr Morrell was challenged
to accept the possibility of injury occurring before the morning of admission
to hospital, but his response was forthright.� The signs and symptoms on 13th
September are consistent with the findings of the brain scan, which does not
admit to earlier insults and delayed presentation.� That, he said, is not
feasible clinically.� 

�That an earlier injury causing a
haemorrhage was initially quiescent, but then emerged with the symptoms then
displayed does not fit with a clinical scenario that I would recognise.�

 

����������� Thus
whatever neurological insult occurred happened within hours of admission.� 

 

34.             
There was a
good deal of discussion about the possibility that the baby was struggling from
time to time with his breathing.� Dr Morrell was perfectly satisfied that the
child had not in his short life experienced difficulty of such severity as to
starve his brain, however temporarily, of oxygen.� Had there been an airway
obstruction of significance then the consequence would have been evident on the
scan, but there was nothing.� He said:

�Had there been for example
hypoxic ischaemic damage there would have been continuing symptoms, which did
not present themselves.��� 

 

����������� There
was no evidence put before the court which could challenge that expert
opinion.� As I have already recorded, in answer to the suggestion that the
chronic subdural haematomas were present and would explain the seizure on the
morning of 13th September, he had this to say:

�Chronic subdural haematomas can
cause raised pressure on the brain, but that will not cause a seizure without
pre-existing, significant symptoms.��� 

 

����������� I
asked Dr Morrell myself whether or not these symptoms would be observable to
the uninformed bystander.� His answer was plain.� They would.� Over how long a
period before a fit?� Within a few hours was his answer.� Thus, as he said, it
does not seem possible that chronic subdural haematomas were present for a
while and suddenly and spontaneously caused an acute phase.� He was firm in his
view.� Again, as he said, it is probable that the insult occurred within
minutes of the collapse.

35.             
Dr Stoodley
was equally plain.� Challenged to consider the possibility of a delayed crisis
he responded in evidence with these words:

�There is no evidence of
underlying brain damage.� Imaging does not reveal a bleed of such mass as to
cause distortion of and pressure to the brain.��� 

 

����������� From
his evidence I conclude that subdural haematomas are unlikely to persist in a
normal, rapidly growing brain unless there has been injury or some hypoxic
event, which plainly there had not been prior to 13th September.� He
was satisfied that the incidence of development from acute to chronic subdural
haematomas is unlikely unless there is an associated brain injury, but, as was
increasingly plain from his and his colleagues in evidence, subdural
haematomas, if they emerge, effectively dissolve in time and therefore
disappear from the scene.� He concluded with these words:

�I would expect a significant
change of behaviour at the moment of the event.� I cannot find on the scans an
earlier trauma and then a lucid interval.� Thus the causative event took place
after the last time that the child was observed to be behaving normally.�� 

 

36.             
It is plain
that the overall view of the meeting was that, subject to my conclusion that Dr
Stoodley�s explanation of the images on the scans is one which I accept, the
injury to V�s brain and his seizures arising from that injury occurred on the
morning of 13th September.� My short response is this.� Just as Dr
Shalala defers to Dr Stoodley, so also do I accept his expertise and his
evidence.� There is no or no adequate challenge to his findings and on the
requisite test I am satisfied that there was one effusion arising from one acute
insult, causing multiple bleeds on V�s brain.� Thus I find that the conclusion
of the meeting was correct and that it is more likely than not that the brain
injury occurred on the morning of 13th September and cannot be
explained by an occurrence on any other day.

37.             
The timing of
the fractures.� The opinion of Dr Chapman is overwhelming and, in my view,
unassailable.� There were two skeletal surveys, the first within three days of
the admission to hospital on 13th September and the second on 4th
October.� By the time of the second survey some three weeks later all the
fractures had healed.� Such fractures are known to take about five or six weeks
post-injury to heal and if therefore five weeks is accepted as the minimum time
then there is no possibility that the fractures occurred around 13th
September.� I remind myself that both legs had suffered fractures, two
fractures to the right leg and one to the left.� In addition his arm had
suffered a fracture.� While the doctor conceded that it was possible that the
fractures to the legs had occurred on the same occasion, it was not in his view
possible that the arm had suffered injury at the same time.� Thus these
fractures must have occurred on at least two separate dates.� The logic for
that assertion seems persuasive.

38.             
There is no
doubt, as he and Dr Morrell agreed, that it is notoriously difficult to date
metaphyseal fractures, but there is equally no doubt that the fractures were
not inflicted on the same occasion as the brain injury.� However, looking back
from the second scan on 4th October, Dr Chapman was reasonably
confident that the fractures occurred at the very end of August or the very
beginning of September.�� The further away, either into August or into
September, the less confident he could be.� Nonetheless, by the fifth day of
the hearing it had become plain to the parties and particularly to the local
authority that on the basis of the compelling evidence from the experts, the
timing of the injuries was such that it was not possible to maintain that K,
the child�s aunt, was in the likely pool of perpetrators given that it was
agreed that the last occasion that she had had contact with her nephew (to the
extent of having the opportunity to inflict damage on him) was 25th
August.� Thus it was not possible for her to have inflicted the injury to the
brain on the day which I have already accepted was the date of the insult,
namely 13th September.� Also, the likelihood of fractures occurring
to the boy�s limbs on that date was regarded by Dr Chapman as unlikely.� Again
there is no evidence to contradict that of the jointly instructed experts in
the field and therefore I accept that the local authority would not be
successful in establishing on the balance of probabilities that K was in the
pool of possible perpetrators, let alone the perpetrator herself.

39.             
The timing of
the bruise.� As Dr Morrell made plain in the experts� meeting, it is equally
difficult to judge the age of bruising from its appearance.� He noted however,
as I have already mentioned in this judgment, that there is no record of the
bruise when the child was admitted to hospital.� That being the case, then it
could imply a very recent injury, because a bruise could still be developing
during the period in which the child was being admitted to hospital.� It would
either be less noticeable or even missed.� However, it is reasonably obvious
that a bruise does not present itself at the moment of the insult to the flesh
and therefore one must conclude that either there was a blow or other
inappropriate use of force inflicted on the child�s chest at hospital, which in
my view is highly unlikely, or in a short period before his admission to
hospital on 13th September when the child suffered a forceful blow
or pressure and the evidence of trauma appeared within a short time of his
admission.� As I have already indicated, I proceed on the civil standard and
must be satisfied as to what is more likely than not.� On that basis I conclude
that it is highly unlikely that the medical personnel inflicted that injury
upon the child and that therefore the bruise is more likely than not to have
been caused by inappropriate force being used before admission to hospital at
some point on the morning of 13th September.

40.             
The lay
witnesses.� In addition to the medical experts whom I have identified, I heard
from a number of witnesses called on behalf of N and G.� I also received
evidence from Denise Levermore, the family nurse.� I did not derive the
greatest assistance from these witnesses.� In each case they were remarkably vague
when they might have been expected to be precise and yet on other occasions
they gave very detailed accounts of memories which one would have expected to
have faded.� Thus I was to hear from KB, a former boyfriend of K, V�s aunt, who
lurched from the vague, protesting that he had a bad memory, to belligerent
when he was challenged to the very detailed criticism of JW, when he appeared
to be sneering as he spoke.� His ability to remember anything at all seemed to
be something of a challenge if, as was frequently the case, he did not care for
the question.� He remembered for example with great clarity bouncing V on his
knee on the day before the hospital admission, describing a scene of absolutely
no consequence in minute detail.� Yet, having in his police interview recalled
that K and N were screaming at each other in Ikea on 7th September,
he claimed that that had not been the case and that their voices were simply
raised.� He became visibly irritated when he was asked to recall what it was
they were arguing about.� As it happens I regard the meeting at Ikea by most of
the lay personnel in the case save for G, who was not present, as being of no
great moment or indeed relevance.� I am used in these courts to hearing
evidence of screaming which is little more, on analysis, than hyperbole.� He
regarded V, he said, as his �nephew�, a surprising assertion, since although V
and his mother shared KB�s home as a result of his mother�s generosity, he was
self-evidently not related to him and he had only been in the child�s company
for a matter of weeks.� Why therefore he should present (as he described it) in
such an emotional state in the police interview, protesting it would not be
picture perfect because of his anxiety, is difficult to understand,
particularly since the interview itself records him as being in high spirits,
sharing laughs with the interviewer.� 

41.             
The only
evidence from this witness upon which I could safely rely was his inability to
detect any particularly alarming feature in V�s crying.� He, like his mother in
due course and as N was to say in her evidence, observed that V appeared to
suffer significantly from colic, but although uncomfortable was not exhibiting
any particularly alarming symptom which would concern the uninformed observer.�
I am persuaded, however, that he was telling the truth when he asserted that K
and her sister N both doted on V.

42.             
KB�s mother,
A, struck me as kind-hearted.� She had agreed without hesitation that N should
take up temporary accommodation in her home with V after N was thrown out of
her mother�s home when the baby was just three weeks old.� She knew little, if
anything, about N save that she was the sister of her son�s girlfriend.� She
gave helpful evidence about N�s relationship with her son.� A particularly striking
part of her evidence was that both mother and son would �light up� upon seeing
each other.� I found that evidence to be spontaneous and compelling.� She was
also helpful as a mother of some experience when she described V�s crying thus:

�Nothing in his presentation
alarmed me.� His cry was just an ordinary baby cry.� As for the colic, my
daughter had had colic and that caused pain until it was resolved and that
maybe caused me to identify a similar history in V.�

 

����������� She
was able to reassure N that a change in V�s food would very probably resolve
his discomfort, both from her own experience and from that of a neighbour whose
baby had exhibited similar symptoms.� It appeared from her evidence, which I
accepted, that her diagnosis and the outcome were both correct.� Unlike the
other lay witnesses, A did not attempt to demonise either G or N.� V�s mother
was, she said, like her sister, clearly very close to the baby whilst she
candidly accepted that she saw nothing in G�s interaction with V to concern
her.

43.             
The local
authority called M to the stand, supported by a manuscript statement which it
appears she had composed only a week beforehand.� Her evidence however came as
a surprise to no-one.� She is the mother of a little boy, R, now four.� She
described a curious relationship with G, which appears to have endured for some
five years, moving between friendship and a deeper relationship, which one
assumes was sexual and quite close.� She was not prepared to indicate why it
was that the relationship kept breaking down and she protested that when it did
she and G remained at a distance for only a few weeks before resuming their
friendship.� 

44.             
In the summer
of 2013, G had been left alone with her son whilst she visited the shops.� I
detected from her evidence that although G was well liked by R and although he
did mind the child from time to time she did not rely upon him as a regular
babysitter and she did not classify G as a father figure, no matter how close
he was to her and her son.� While she was at the shops G and R had a
confrontation and the boy was being rather naughty and had taken hold of a
television remote.� It appears that that irritated G, who was unable to control
the situation, and when the child refused to hand the remote over to him, but
kicked out with his bare feet, one of them coming into contact with G�s chin, G
reacted by striking the toddler across the face.� While no great physical
damage was done the child was clearly upset and later that afternoon, after G
had left, he reported the incident to his mother, describing how G had smacked
him across the head.� M was outraged and telephoned G for an explanation.� When
he initially failed to disclose what had happened, until he was challenged with
the specifics, M had said that she would �do� him and thereafter broadcast his
behaviour on Facebook.

45.             
Following
that confrontation G himself elected to visit the police and inform them as to
the occurrence and it seems that the police chose to warn him about his
behaviour, but to leave things as they were.� The incident was however logged
and although he was not charged, there is a record of unlawful chastisement on
the police logs.� 

46.             
The curious
way in which M gave her evidence and the issue of whether or not she was an
abusive parent were not wholly relevant to this case, but in passing one might
express some surprise at the manner in which G chose in his statement to
describe her parenting in less than complimentary terms.� Certainly his
endeavour, if endeavour it was, to deflect the observer�s attention from his
worrying behaviour to that of R�s mother was to entirely miss the point.�
Subsequent evidence suggested that she was not being entirely open or honest
either about the manner in which she treated G and their relationship or indeed
about her approaches to him last week, but although a little surprising, that
evidence did not detract from the primary issue, that of G�s assault upon her
infant son.�������������������������� 

47.             
G called AB
in support of his case that N was both violent and abusive.� AB however was not
a persuasive witness.� Describing himself as like a brother to G, he asserted
that he was extremely concerned about the relationship with N.� He deposed
about that which he claimed G had confided in him, asserting that N would use
physical force against him.� In fact his written statement on this issue is
impossible to decipher, speaking of �fingers using force� in language which
simply makes no sense.� Doing the best one can, it appears that AB was
attempting to describe how N would grip G�s arms, presumably hard.� At its
height his evidence went no further than that.� 

48.             
However, in
some puzzling way, AB had devised, he said, a code whereby instead of G having
to tell him that N had lost her temper and had been violent towards him, he
would instead utilise the term �presents,� so that should N overhear the two of
them talking she would not be alerted to the fact that G would be speaking of
her violence.� I confess that I found that evidence wholly unconvincing, both
because G and AB would not have to speak in her presence in any event given
that it was obvious that the two of them would spend a good deal of time
together without N being there and, secondly, because upon my inquiry, AB
conceded that the code had only been used once or, as he said, possibly twice
when he had telephoned G and asked him whether or not he had received any such
present, to which the answer had been yes, but no more.� It was wholly
unsatisfactory that AB then indicated that he �would have� spoken to G about
that later.� He was quite unable to give any particulars of any such subsequent
discussion, nor any description of the present to which he was referring.� 

49.             
He insisted
that G would never hurt the infant and protested that he was entirely innocent
of any of the blame for V�s various injuries.� One had to assume therefore, as
he clearly did, that the only person who could have injured the baby was his
mother.� During one particularly unsatisfactory interlude in his evidence, AB
suddenly blurted out that N was not as innocent as she looked.� I derived no
satisfaction from hearing about all or any other part of his evidence, which I
am afraid to say I found to be wholly unreliable.

50.             
G then called
AG in support of his case, a neighbour whom I found to be an unreliable
historian.� As questions developed it appeared that despite his denials, (for
he asserted that he had not discussed the case with G at all, let alone in any
detail), AG knew a very great deal more about the case than he first
suggested.� When he was pressed he gave a reasonably clear account of his
understanding of G�s movements on the morning of 13th September.� He
spoke of G laying V on the settee and the child being unable to breathe and of
G administering CPR.� It had all happened in a flash, it seemed from AG�s
evidence, yet despite the detail, which included G�s suggestion that N should
make a bottle for the child, nothing was said about attempts to keep a dummy in
V�s mouth, nor about the child being placed in the bouncing frame or the
supposed difficulty in settling him.� 

51.             
This witness
spoke in detail of 27th August, a date which he asserted he could
remember with greatest clarity.� It appears to be accepted by all parties that
this was likely to have been the first date when G was left alone with V.�
Indeed it was later to be confirmed by N that when she returned from her
expedition, G was then at his flat with V and AG.� By the time AG came on to
the scene it is plain that G had already changed V�s nappy.� He was holding it
in his hand when he answered the door.� G was to admit in due course that N had
left him to prepare a feed, then feed the child, then wind him and then change
him.� AG saw nothing to suggest that there had been any difficulty and he
remained talking to G until N returned.� That did not tell me a great deal.� I
do not know how long it was after the baby had been changed that AG came on to
the scene.� It appears however that when he did so the baby was settled.� Of
particular importance therefore is not whether or not in the time before that gentleman
came to the flat there had been something untoward, but if there had been,
would AG have known?

52.             
It will be
realised therefore that there are two particularly important issues arising
from the medical evidence which cannot be avoided.� First, the window or
timeframe in which V is taken to have been likely to have suffered the
fractures was opening at this time.� As Dr Chapman had said, it was entirely
likely that the fractures had been inflicted at the very end of August or the
very beginning of September, although the further away from those dates the
more uneasy he became.� It is for this reason, as I have said, that the local
authority had abandoned its assertion that K could have been responsible for
the fractures when she had the care of the child on 25th August.�
Secondly, the presentation of a baby suffering from metaphyseal fractures would
in all probability not be sufficient to alarm the uninformed observer after
some 10 minutes or so from the insult since the baby would very probably settle
within that period.

53.             
Therefore,
what could AG tell us?� On analysis not much.� The baby was settled when he saw
him and AG was satisfied in generality as to G�s own demeanour and his
suggested gentleness.� That particular assertion was a little surprising, since
he overlooked the behaviour of his young friend only months before when he was
awoken from his night-time slumbers by a serious commotion in the block of
flats in which they were neighbours, to which the police had been called.� G
was behaving in a worrying and indeed dangerous manner and had to be
restrained.� He was sectioned that night and was later assessed by a
psychiatrist, whose notes are found at G352.� It was suggested by AG, as if to
dismiss it, that it was alcohol fuelled and yet strangely, despite apparently
visiting his flat for several times a week, he had no recollection of or had
not noticed that G had smashed up his flat on another occasion, (whether
fuelled by depression or alcohol would therefore be something of which he
presumably would be unaware).� I found his evidence to be unpersuasive and
provable of very little, if anything.

54.             
On the third
day of the case JW emerged from the shadows, or should I say was drawn into the
case from the shadows as a result of an application by counsel on behalf of G.�
The court had permitted J, V�s father, to remain present as an observer, albeit
represented, given that he is the birth father.� During the months before the
case came to trial J had been the subject of a parenting assessment since he had
offered himself as a carer for his son after discovering that he had been
placed in foster care.� Counsel had had the wit to look at that parenting
assessment and had discovered that part way through J, in giving the history of
his relationship with N, had recorded that while he had not been violent to her
she had been violent to him and she had, he asserted, head-butted him during
one particularly violent argument.� Anticipating that the case against G would
include the record of his own loss of self-control when in 2013 he struck R
across the head, counsel sought to introduce this allegation against N and
could only do so on calling J.� After hearing argument on the issue I acceded
to the application and over the following 24 hours J�s solicitor prepared a
witness statement on his behalf and in due course he came to the stand.� 

55.             
I anticipated
that his appearance might have caused some trepidation at the Bar since, given
the outcome of the parenting assessment which disqualified him as a carer and
raised a particular issue about his use of cannabis and his difficulties with
anger management, he might have been regarded as something of a loose cannon,
but as it transpired his evidence revealed a young man who had reflected
carefully about his behaviour and who presented as thoroughly candid in his
evidence.� He left me in no doubt but that he was endeavouring to tell the
truth and that he was deeply ashamed of the thoroughly unpleasant way in which
he treated N, verbally abusing her and frightening her very significantly.� He
accepted that there were regular arguments in which he endeavoured to control N
to the extent of not permitting her to set foot outside their accommodation
without his approval or even his presence.� He would belittle her and insult
her and had by March 2013 become intensely jealous of her, not as a result of
her behaviour, but because of the paranoia induced by his increasing use of
cannabis, which she had endeavoured to persuade him to cease, with little
success.� He had smashed up one phone of hers and had run off with another.�
Ultimately he was to steal �40 from her purse.� At the very least he was
terribly unkind to her and there was little doubt but that she was the victim
of recurring domestic abuse.� When she alleged and it was put to him in
cross-examination that he had broken down the bathroom door when she took
refuge away from him, he initially denied it at the stand, but ultimately, upon
hearing her evidence, he reflected once more and recalled that he had after all
broken into the bathroom and he conceded as such through counsel when N was
part way through her oral evidence.

56.             
As I have
said, J�s evidence was refreshing in its candour, but there remained areas in
which there was nonetheless some uncertainty.� There was no doubt that many of
the arguments were fuelled by cannabis and probably by alcohol.� There is also
little doubt that even now some of J�s recollections remain hazy.� A prime
example is the bathroom incident, which he denied outright when first
challenged about it at the stand.� He did insist however that N had head-butted
him.� He insisted that his memory was quite clear on that issue as he described
how the last argument between them, which lasted into the small hours of the
morning and resulted eventually in his lying on his back on the bed effectively
challenging N to get him out of her flat, had continued.� He described how he
had goaded her and laughed at her, effectively showing her how powerless she
was.� He then described how she struck him on his nose with her head.� Whether
that can be described as a head-butt remains unclear since in popular
television or cinema drama typically one might observe the use of a head as a
weapon, striking the forehead of the victim with the forehead or the top of the
head of the assailant.� In this instance he revealed that her head struck his
nose, which itself had not bled.� It is doubtful that he gave the most serious
thought to that injury and if N had struck him in that way at all - and there
remains some doubt about that - I do not take the view that it should be
classified as an indication of a serious attack.� Although N denies the blow �
and she was only challenged repeatedly about a head-butt � I take the view that
in all probability she could well have been desperate enough to do anything to
fight back at her abuser and get him out of her accommodation and in her
desperation she might well have struck him in the face.� She conceded that she
had pushed him in the face with her outstretched hand.� The particularity however
is not easy to accept since the alleged victim was again fuelled by cannabis
and/or alcohol and I doubt that his recollection would have been as clear as he
imagines.� 

57.             
I anticipated
it would be said, and indeed in submissions beforehand it was argued, that
bringing J to the stand was to achieve balance.� If it were more than that and
if it was designed to show that N was an abuser or is prone to violent
outbursts, then it failed.� Instead it revealed that her abuser was remorseful
and, in answer to my own question, J said that he had not detected any
impatience in the way that N behaved with their son on the few occasions that
he saw them together.� Subject to my interpretation of the alleged head-butt,
in the very few instances where their evidence differed I preferred that of N,
although in the main I remain satisfied that J was endeavouring to tell me the
truth.

58.             
KH, N�s older
sister, was in fact the first lay witness to be called.� She had found herself
in the pool of possible perpetrators because of the few times in which she had
cared for V on her own.� There were three nights when she babysat overnight
with V.� As I have said, the dates were common ground and after receiving the
evidence of Dr Chapman the local authority conceded that K was outside the
timeframe in which the baby suffered the fractures, nor did she have contact
with the baby at the time it had become clear he suffered the brain injury.� K
could be of little more assistance.� Like a good number of the other witnesses
she struggled on numerous occasions with her� memory, but essentially I did not
detect that she was seeking to mislead the court in the primary focus of her
evidence, which, having disposed of the dates when she could have had any
unsupervised contact with V, the remainder of her evidence focused on her
admiration for her younger sister�s endeavours to care for her nephew and, when
asked, she sought with limited success to assist the court with her
understanding of the baby�s cries.

59.             
The baby
appeared to have something of a different cry ever since he was born, she
said.� It had been described by J as something akin to a squeak, explained he
thought by the child�s soft larynx.� Indeed it was noticed by the general
practitioner in the early part of September when J attended the surgery.� On
the one occasion, on 7th September, which I have described as
something of a gathering at Ikea when J had had contact with his son and was
returning with him, K noticed what she regarded as a particularly distressed
cry.� 

60.             
As I hope
will become plain from this judgment, I take the view that the baby was
probably giving out signals that from time to time he was indeed very
uncomfortable, but we must remember that he had fractures to four different
sites and from the expert evidence which I have heard, those fractures were no
more than seven to 14 days old.� When resting and still he would be
asymptomatic.� When disturbed however it is entirely probable, in my view, that
he would experience discomfort.� I therefore do not dismiss K�s recollection,
but I put it in context.

61.             
On the
morning of the tenth day of the hearing the court was presented with the second
of two manuscript statements, this time written by ST, who, it transpired, was
a friend of both N and G.� It appeared that she had accompanied N and given her
support for three of the ten days the hearing had lasted (I am giving judgment
on day 13).� She was, as I say and as was generally conceded, a friend of both
G and N and had known them both for some years.� N, she said, was like a sister
to her.� She had known G since college.� She was aware that V had been taken to
hospital and she knew that he had suffered a seizure and he had had bleeds to
his brain.� She also knew that V had been in foster care since September and
that N was understandably distressed at being parted from her baby.� 

62.             
She � that is
ST � had revealed to K or N � it matters not which � a few weeks after V had
been admitted to hospital that she had recalled an incident, now some four
years ago, when G and she had spent a short time together one morning when she
was babysitting for her infant nephew.� Nothing more had been made of that
incident until Friday of last week after G had concluded his evidence-in-chief
at the stand and when K recalled what it was that had been said to her and her
sister last autumn.� It appears that ST�s disclosure was discussed with K�s
legal team, one of whom was deputed to approach ST and asked her to give a
statement.� She was most reluctant to do so given that she was a friend of both
G and N and she became quite tearful and angry at the suggestion.� However,
despite her protests, she was prevailed upon and she elected to put a statement
before the court explaining that if she did not do so she feared that what she
had to report would perhaps be exaggerated.

63.             
In fact her
evidence was indeed important and the Bar conceded that she should be
interposed before G was cross-examined.� At the stand she maintained her
evidence, that being that during the hour or so that she and her nephew, JN,
then 18 months old, had spent with G he behaved inappropriately.� She had left
JN in his company for a short period while she, on her evidence, dashed to the
shops to get hold of some nappies for the child since none had been provided by
her sister.� When she returned she found that JN was particularly clingy and
would not let go of her.� It appeared that during her absence he had urinated
on the floor.� G took the view that the child should not be allowed to cling to
his aunt in that way and he took it upon himself to administer some form of
correction.� That, in ST�s evidence, took the form of his raising the child�s
arm above his head and then administering a sharp slap to the child�s thigh
below the recently placed nappy.� That, she told the court, left a red mark.� The
child was immediately distressed and cried, but G insisted that he should be
placed on a sofa and should not be comforted by his aunt.� He indicated to ST
that she should sit opposite the boy on the other sofa so that, to use my
words, the correction would not be watered down or excused.� ST found the
experience excruciating.� She realised that it did not last for an eternity,
but it seemed like that.� G, she said, was insistent.� She would be a bad
mother if she did not maintain the correction and if she gave in and cuddled
the child in those or similar circumstances.

64.             
If her
recollection is right, it bears an unhappy resemblance to the admonitions by G
to N of lazy parenthood during the arguments about V�s dummy.� This was
remarkable evidence and understandably ST was challenged at some length both as
to her presence in court at all and as to her recollection.� G did not, as it
transpired when he was recalled to the stand, deny that there had been the
meeting of which ST spoke, nor did he deny remembering placing the child on the
sofa and requiring ST to leave him and not immediately comfort him.� He did
however deny emphatically that he had ever struck the child, angrily insisting
that it would be quite wrong to strike a child.� The irony of that insistence
appeared to have been lost on him given that three years later he had lashed
out at R.� As counsel for the local authority pointed out to him, the incident
and its surrounding detail was, save for the slap, clearly not invented by ST.�
ST was a timid witness, who was clearly distressed at being called to the stand
and she was clearly unready for what she viewed as an ordeal.� It was suggested
that her evidence was fabricated and that her disclosure had been made up,
rather than forgotten about or overlooked in the months leading to the trial.�
However, without wishing to be unkind to her, I found her not to be the most
forthright or quick thinking of individuals.� She did not, in my judgment,
appear mischievous.� To the contrary, she was visibly uncomfortable at having
to be involved at all between two friends.

65.             
For his part
G accused her, when questioned, of lying and of being part of a conspiracy
against him.� I have considered his responses and the evidence given by ST most
carefully.� Where the two of them diverge � and they do so only in two areas,
one being the length of time that ST was out of JN�s presence buying nappies, G
claiming she was away for up to 40 minutes whilst she insisted it was no more
than 10 or 15, the other being his assault on the boy � I take the view that ST
was not lying and I prefer her evidence to G�s.

66.             
The family
nurse, Denise Levermore, gave evidence which in some respects was puzzling.�
Having lodged a statement at the request of the local authority confirming her
admiration for N, she came to the stand and initially repeated her positive
remarks.� N was, she said, an admirable young woman.� She had confronted and
overcome the difficulties presented by her childhood, parental mental
ill-health, the abuse suffered at the hands of J and her pregnancy at the age
of 16.� Her interaction with the baby caused her no anxiety.� She was, she
deposed, a resilient and determined young mother, delighted at the pregnancy
and the newborn baby.� Her notes, which were almost indecipherable, recorded
N�s pleasure at being pregnant and her adherence to all the necessary health
checks for the child in whom she clearly delighted.� 

67.             
It was not
immediately obvious therefore why the nurse thought it appropriate to then make
some curious and even disparaging remarks about N�s failure to disengage from
J, which on analysis was not true, as it became plain in the evidence that
despite her tender years and her vulnerability at the hands of her abusive
partner she did manage eventually to eject him from her flat and terminate the
relationship, and about her apparent disinterest in V�s medical report which
was disclosed to the child protection meeting, which again was inaccurate since
N had had the medical report disclosed to her some days previous to that by the
police.� It remains a mystery to me given that it is the local authority�s case
that N had failed to protect her unborn child and thereafter her baby why at
this front line stage, if I can call it that, the family nurse and indeed at
least one other social worker with whom N was clearly cooperating made no
effort to assist her either with alternative accommodation or over
disengagement from J, about whose abuse they were clearly aware, or perhaps
with an appropriate educational resource such as the Freedom Project.� None of
this was mentioned to N and it remained entirely unclear why it was that the
nurse during her evidence appeared to become increasingly critical of her.� I
found that aspect of her evidence unsatisfactory.

68.             
She referred
to her experience as a social worker and a health visitor of some 20 years.�
She was able to rely on her own sense that something was wrong about G�s
presentation.� She said that she found him controlling.� He was asking
inappropriate questions given the brevity of his relationship with N and her
baby.� She was concerned about his relationship with this young mother some
eight or nine years his junior and so recently out of an abusive relationship.�
He appeared, she said, to dominate discussions with the nurse to the extent
that N appeared to be excluded.� Of course N had not informed her of G�s
disclosure of his assault upon R.� Given the nurse�s inactivity thus far, it is
however not clear what she would have done with that information, because in
due course she did establish it for herself by making contact with the police
and discovering that the assault was on G�s record.� There is a suggestion on
the notes that she was about to follow the appropriate path for a referral to
child protection, but given that she had thus far not offered any relevant help
to N, who had in her own words been told by another social worker that she �
that is N � was doing her job for her, it remains unclear just how quickly, if
at all, the nurse would have ensured N was given the appropriate advice and
given the necessary help to extricate herself from a possibly further abusive
situation.

69.             
There was one
matter which remained unresolved and to which I shall return briefly in due
course.� The nurse saw a bruise on N�s face.� As it happens the nurse recorded
it, no doubt increasingly anxious about the abuse which N was reporting at the
hands of V�s father.� However she did not, as far as can be established,
challenge N about it.� If there was a failure to protect herself and her unborn
child, then at whom should the finger be pointed?� Perhaps at N, but perhaps
also at one of the first trip wires or advance guards of the statutory child
protection agency.

70.             
Finally, I
must turn to N and G, first to assess them as witnesses and then to examine the
question of the identity of the culprit, given that it is now generally
accepted by the Bar and the local authority that they are the only two
remaining occupants of the pool.

71.             
N.� We have
to remember that N was 16 when she conceived.� In the same year she left home
with little opposition from her mother, who, if she did not actively collude in
the abuse which N suffered as a child, was aware of it.� That lady suffered
from depression and gave no support to her daughter.� N was 17 when she gave
birth and although she returned home, she was to be assaulted and forcibly
ejected by her father with her three-week-old baby in the most disgraceful
fashion.� As a teenager, those who should have protected and cared for her
turned her backs on her, while the relationship with the father of her unborn
child, a young man of questionable record and two failed relationships behind
him, brought her literally out of the frying pan and into the fire.� Yet she
was emerging from this perfectly dreadful background determined to better
herself and had managed to secure a place against significant competition with
the National Stud, in Cambridge and was on the path to a rewarding career.�
Then she became pregnant, a development which might have caused a lesser person
to have descended into self-pity or to seek a termination of her pregnancy.�
She did neither.� From the evidence which I have heard and which I accept, far
from resenting it, she delighted in her pregnancy.� I shall come to my
assessment of the evidence against her and against G in due course, but my
assessment of her as a witness is that, notwithstanding areas where she
candidly admitted that a number of her responses either in that which appears
in her written evidence or in her police interviews were mistaken, I can rely
on her as a witness of truth.� 

72.             
Again I must
remember that at a very young age she suddenly found herself in a maelstrom.�
Her baby had been taken to hospital with, as it initially appeared, the most
worrying symptoms.� In short order she was then told that her baby, on whom she
clearly doted, had an injury to his brain and then late at night and for the
first time in her life she was to spend hours under close questioning in a
police interview room facing two police officers and a tape machine into the small
hours of the morning.� Her situation was not just daunting; it must have been
frightening.� Therefore, I can forgive her for laxness in coherent narrative
and for errors in time or sequence.

73.             
Two matters,
perhaps minor but important in my assessment, struck me.� One was her general
presentation, the other an example of truthfulness.� The first was the manner
of her demeanour at the stand over the best part of two days.� She was obliged
to endure firm, although courteous, questioning sometimes repeated, from no
less than six inquisitors learned in the law.� If it were anticipated that she
was quick to anger or impatient with the questions, she was neither.� She
described herself at one point in response to a suggestion that she would lose
control as being quite the opposite and I believe her.� Her self-control was
admirable and in distinct contrast to that of, for example, K.� She was
certainly distressed and there were moments when she had to be given a
breathing space, but those moments were rare.� Given the enormity of the
allegations against her, I found her composure to be compelling rather than
pretended.

74.             
The example
of which I speak was but a small part of her cross-examination, but a telling
one.� Towards the conclusion of her evidence she was asked about the bruise to
her face.� It was, as the nurse had noted, just below the eye.� Had J caused
that, she was asked.� She reflected and had to do so more than once, but
repeated that she simply could not remember the bruise.� A witness of less
character, indeed a dishonest witness, having been challenged to describe her
experiences at the hands of J, whom she did not immediately trust to have any
unsupervised contact with V, contact which she initially opposed until being
talked round by her sister, might very well have taken the opportunity to build
on the suspicion of the nurse and use this one obvious and objectively provable
indication of physical abuse in an attack on J.� She did not.� Indeed she
denied that the bruise was caused by his hand.� 

75.             
Again, I find
her honesty to be compelling and when challenged to accept that only she and G
now occupied the pool and when presented point blank by counsel for V with the
challenge that she harmed him or knew of the harm to which he had been exposed,
she was visibly appalled.� �He�s my boy,� she protested.� I found it impossible
to ignore the depth of unspoken emotion behind that response.

76.             
G.� That
causes me to turn to the emotional response of G.� We know that on several
occasions in his police interview he was in tears.� Again, I accept that having
to endure questioning in the police station would have been almost as
distressing for him as it was for N, although it was not the first time that G
had ever been to a police station and indeed only a few months before G had
spent an entire night in police cells, having been detained at his flat
following his troubling behaviour, which had resulted in his being taken into
custody.� But why, I wondered, was he again tearful within moments of coming to
the stand in his evidence-in-chief?� Because, he said when he had composed
himself, he had lost his family.� I found that to be not the most convincing of
answers given that he had only had the most fleeting of relationships with N
and her son.� They had met on 5th July 2013 and within a few days of
V�s admission to hospital on 13th September the relationship had
ended.� Plainly, he viewed the relationship far more intensely than N and
equally plainly they became close very quickly and by early August N was a
frequent overnight visitor to his flat, but his emotional reaction explained by
that answer was not the most persuasive.� That alone of course was not
sufficient to provide an overview of his presentation as a witness but there
are other equally troubling areas in which he failed to convince me of his
reliability.

77.             
It is
appropriate therefore to remind myself of the standard direction which is given
to juries in appropriate cases arising from the case of R v Lucas 73 Cr
App R.� This is a direction, as I say, given to juries and I remind myself that
in this instance at this stage of proceedings I am trying jury questions and
the direction to which I refer is a direction which has been drawn from that
case and it is now used frequently in the Crown Court by judges directing juries
within the scope of standard directions prepared by the Judicial Studies
Board.� The test of that standard direction reads as follows:

�The mere fact that a defendant
tells a lie is not in itself evidence of guilt.� A defendant may lie for many
reasons and they may possibly be innocent ones in the sense that they do not
denote guilt.� For example, they could be lies to bolster a true defence, to
protect somebody else, to conceal some disgraceful conduct other than the
commission of the offence, or out of panic, distress or confusion. If the jury
thinks that there is or may be an innocent explanation for the lies then the
jury should take no notice of them.� Only if the jury are satisfied that he has
not lied for an innocent reason then his lies could be regarded by the jury as
evidence going to prove guilt.





78.             
As his
evidence developed I became less persuaded that G was a witness of truth.� He
contradicted himself on numerous occasions to the extent that eventually it was
not possible to establish whether he had told the truth to the police in
interview, or to the court in his written evidence, or finally to the court in
his oral evidence.� He rounded on counsel in one angry outburst and he came to
the point of almost refusing to answer questions at all when Mr Varter on
behalf of N was seeking to establish why he had not immediately called an
ambulance.� Was it not the case, Mr Varter asked, that G feared that V was
dead?� How dare counsel ask him that question, he demanded.� He had never said
any such thing.� On this occasion � and it was not the only one � instead of
tears there was fury on G�s face, fury that was wholly misplaced because, as Mr
Varter subsequently pointed out, G had on three separate occasions in his
police interview indicated he had feared that V had died.

79.             
Naturally,
evidence does not stand or fall on the outcome of one exchange, but it was
significant, and his denials and changes of mind and contradictions built one
on the other until eventually I could place little reliance on his evidence.�
Out of fairness, I should give more examples.� Thus he insisted he had visited
the police after his assault on R as an indication of his immediate remorse and
recognition of his inappropriate behaviour.� I do not accept that.� He visited
the police only after he had been telephoned by M, the child�s mother, who
promised in her angry exchange to have him �done� for it.� Before that
telephone call he had said nothing to R�s mother on her return from her
expedition and had then gone to the gym.� When later she telephoned him he did
not volunteer what had happened until she challenged him.� In his written
evidence he sought to explain his silence by suggesting that he was in fact
protecting the boy from further physical admonitions by his mother, who would,
he suggested, punish him once more for fooling around with the television
remote.� That assertion was wholly unpersuasive.

80.             
He insisted
as his cross-examination opened that he had never had treatment for anger
issues.� He was pressed on the subject.� He maintained his denial.� That was
patently untrue, given that he was then shown his medical records from 1998
revealing an appointment with his general practitioner which recorded that he
had been suffering from anger issues for the previous two years and a very much
more recent letter from the City College seeking to refer him for similar and
indeed more troubling issues, which included his assertion that he was
reporting, at times of stress, the existence of and his awareness of another
person within him.� If that report of his own admissions and anxieties is at
all accurate, then one must feel the greatest concern and indeed sympathy for
him, for it reveals a very troubled soul indeed.� Quite why then he should
assert, as he did in answer to questioning, that he does not get stressed
continued to escape me, for, quite to the contrary, it is perfectly evident
from his record that in May 2013 he was detained by the police, as has already
been said, for behaviour which was not only inappropriate but even dangerous at
his flat, as also was his tension and anxiety very obvious from his demeanour
at the stand.� His initial tearfulness, about which I have remarked, was
repeated until eventually it appeared that upon being faced with an
uncomfortable question or questions which he did not care for he was reduced
very quickly either to ill-concealed annoyance or tears, some of which could be
explained by anxiety, but others which could only have been caused by his
unsuccessful search for a sensible or, in my judgment, an honest explanation.

81.             
I felt
obliged to stop proceedings on a number of occasions and on another, G sought a
break himself when he was not for once in tears after his confrontation with Mr
Varter, when his emotions clearly got the better of him.� His presentation was
rarely better than his first tearful assertion that he had lost his family and
was frequently worse, and counsel for the child asked him patiently and kindly
to reflect carefully on the recording by the psychiatrist who examined him
after his being sectioned in May 2013 that he clearly needed help.� In tears
and barely able to collect himself, G insisted that he did not propose to seek
help from anybody and he could deal with his problems himself.� In direct
contradiction to that assertion, I found his presentation so troubling as he
attempted to respond to that invitation that I called yet a further halt to the
proceedings so that he could recover.

82.             
Returning to
his evidence, it was not possible to establish whether what he said to the
police was more accurate than that which he eventually deposed under
cross-examination.� Thus, although in his statement and in evidence he made
something of an apparent blow to V�s head in a child�s pushchair, he made no
mention of it in his interview to the police.� Yet having told the police that
V had struck his head � he used the term smacked his head � on a wooden part of
the sofa � it transpired that he actually meant the frame of the sofa, which he
asserted had not been particularly well covered � he had mentioned nothing of
that to N.� He claimed that V had a red mark as a result of that blow, but that
it had disappeared after a few minutes and indeed before he left for college,
yet subsequently he claimed that it had not disappeared at all and indeed he had
noticed that in its place when he returned was a bruise.� He was to assert that
that may have been derived from contact between the baby�s head and the nappy
box when N was changing the child, but, as he muttered almost as an aside, he
did not want to get N into trouble.� In his written evidence he asserted that
he had told her of the sofa incident.� In his oral evidence he said that he had
not.� To the police he said that the child pretty much smacked his head on the
sofa.� To the court he said it was not really that bad.� To the police he said
that N had seen a mark on V�s head and that he had pointed it out and mentioned
it to her, but in court he said that he had not.� 

83.             
His
description of the moments between his getting up on the morning of 13th
September to attend to the infant and his eventual calling 999 and speaking to
the ambulance personnel became more and more confusing as his contradictions
mounted.� It was wholly unclear whether the child was crying persistently
throughout, as he asserted part way through his cross-examination, or whether
he settled and resumed crying from time to time, or whether he was not crying
at all, but simply �whinging� most of the time, whether from discomfort or
hunger, since G�s evidence continued to be contradictory, moving from the child
being dopey to being inconsolable.� At one stage he suggested that he put the
child in the cot because he was concerned about his back, although he insisted
in answer to my questions that he could not recall saying that, while on another
he asserted that the child arched his back only immediately before he took him
out of the cot as a result of his scream, when at that moment he became rigid.�


84.             
G insisted
that he did not get stressed, as I have already said, and, as I have already said,
that is an assertion which simply did not withstand the merest scrutiny of his
demeanour.� He insisted that he was a happy soul who liked nothing better than
to make others happy, a statement which he volunteered to counsel for the child
in the face of the similarly unprompted remark in his interview with the police
when he asserted that he enjoyed annoying people.� None of these assertions
assisted me in my endeavours to establish whether he was at all reliable.� 

85.             
The balance
of G�s evidence was equally unhelpful, as was his attack on N in his second
statement when he contradicted his assertions to the police about N�s good
qualities and their loving relationship, choosing then to describe her as
hateful and violent.� He justified his about-turn by his discovery, he said, of
�39 lies� in N�s second statement.� When asked by his counsel in
re-examination, he was unable to give any example save for his insistence that
when she demanded that he telephone for help on 13th September she
did not, as her statement attested, identify the ambulance service.� Another
lie, he said, was that he had never called her �babe�.� 

86.             
I found it
particularly troubling that within moments of the child�s seizure G was
questioning everyone and anyone whom he could address for reassurance that he
had not caused the insult which had befallen the baby.� He asked the ambulance
coordinator, various medical staff at the hospital and even the police for that
reassurance.� He made curious and irrelevant disclosures to the police in interview
about perfectly innocuous details on the sofa and later in his written evidence
he described two incidents which he had not revealed to N until later, one
involving the pushchair and the other the bouncer, advancing in the latter
disclosure in his second, January statement a description of lurching and
jolting, which might fit the shaking mechanism described in the medical
evidence which had been produced in the previous month.� From almost the
commencement of his police interviews it is recorded that he had dissolved into
tears.� This is a man of some nine years senior to N behaving in a way which
has continued to trouble me throughout the case.

87.             
The local
authority puts it succinctly in its closing submissions.� G�s reaction to the
events of the morning of 13th September was suggestive of profound
shock and remorse as he questioned what he might have done, albeit
accidentally, to produce V�s symptoms.� For my part I found it distinctly
unattractive for G in the closing moments of his evidence to assert that N had
herself become exasperated with her son, saying, �Fuck it, let him scream,�
evidence which I found as unpersuasive as that which I did upon hearing AB,
who, as the local authority suggest, concocted with G the assertion that N was
violent to him.

88.             
Opportunity, presentation and identification
of the perpetrator.��� It has become clear that the evidence has identified two
timelines, one for each of the sets of injuries suffered by the baby.� The
first timeline relates to the fractures of his legs and arm, fractures which
are most likely to have occurred in the last days of August or the first day or
so of September. That evidence, as I have already said, is perfectly clear from
that of Dr Chapman.� The second timeline relates to the bruise and the brain
injury.� Again, from the medical evidence before the court, which I have
accepted, that timeline commences from the last moment that V was presenting
normally from a neurological perspective.� To establish that, I am obliged to
examine the evidence I received from those who were last in contact with the
infant.

89.             
I shall
firstly address the second of the two timelines given that we have a greater
degree of certainty as to the date and time of the assault since, having
accepted the medical evidence as to the probable moment of the insult, it is
more likely than not that the injury was inflicted on 13th September
within hours of admission to hospital.� Thus of the two occupants of the pool,
which of them had the opportunity to injure the baby?� There is of course no
independent evidence other than the expert opinion as to timing of which I have
spoken. Whatever happened occurred behind the flat door.� I am obliged
therefore to examine the areas where the two witnesses agree and where they do
not.

90.             
They agree that
on 12th September V was presenting normally.� He was not
particularly comfortable, but there was nothing to suggest that this discomfort
was anything more than colic.� At nine p.m. he took his feed and was put down
to sleep.� G volunteered for the first time in the closing moments of
cross-examination by counsel for the child that N was angry with him and would
not let him near V.� I reject that assertion since it had appeared nowhere
hitherto either in writing or in interview or in evidence.� Other than that,
neither of them suggested that there was anything unusual about the evening or,
therefore, V�s presentation.� N deposed that she remained awake, finding it
hard to sleep.� She said that she passed the time texting on her mobile phone.�
In fact neither of them set out with any great clarity in their written
statements the chronology over the 12 hours between the child�s 9p.m. feed and
the calamity which befell the child at about 9a.m. on the morning of the 13th.�
G appears to in generality speak of getting up at 4 a.m. and then 6.30 a.m. in
answer to the suggestion that he was being caused stress generally by being
late for his work placement.� Under cross-examination that appears to have been
translated into the occurrences of that morning.� N does not in fact give a
timeline herself save under cross-examination, given that again, times do not
appear in her written statements.� 

91.             
To the police
N said this at Fl03:

�After his nine o�clock feed we
put him straight into the cot.� We didn�t like touch him after that, so, you
know, he was in the cot and then � then I found it hard to sleep, so I was up
and stuff.� I picked him up and took him into the living room because he was
crying.� I didn�t want to wake G, because he does like get up with him quite a lot,
so I thought I would let him sleep and stuff.� So I picked him up and took him
into the front room and lay down on the sofa with him and then he fell asleep
and I was just texting my mates on my phone. I thought, �I will try and put him
into the cot,� so I picked him up, went into the bedroom and tried to put him
in and he started stirring again like he didn�t want to be put down, so I
picked him up and took him back, not wanting to wake up G, to try and settle
him again.� Then eventually I put him in and then he started crying and then G
woke up and put a dummy in his mouth and I think he settled again and then we
both went to bed and then, if he cried during the night or slept through it, I
woke up with him in the morning.�� 

 

����������� Thus
no times are given in that interview.���� 

92.             
At the
witness stand she said this:

�I was up in the night with V.�
He started to cry.� We had the habit of swaddling him.� I asked G to re-swaddle
him, but V wriggled and G started to get stressed, so I picked him up and took
him into the living room with me and put him on the sofa and I saw to my
Facebook.� When he�d fallen asleep I took him back to the cot, but that woke
him up and he started crying again, so I woke G to have him rewrapped.� This
time he did and he settled.�� 

 

����������� It
appears to have been generally accepted that this was about 4 o�clock in the
morning, but G�s account appears not to have been on all fours with N�s.� At
F11 he says, as I have already mentioned, in what appears to be the historical
present tense:

�I have just started this course
and obviously, you know, I�m trying my hardest to be there on time, but, you
know, he cries in the morning about four o�clock, so I had to get up, wrap him
up and make sure he�s alright, see to him, go to bed and everything and then
get up at half past six again.� He�s not hungry or anything, because he�s just
started sleeping through.� He�s just, you know, getting a bit � and then he
just needs something to know that people are there.� 

 

93.             
In his first
statement at paragraph 33 he writes this:

 

�V slept a lot that evening.� N
put him to bed at about 9 to 10 p.m. and he slept through until he woke at 4
a.m.� There was nothing that happened on 12th September that caused
me any concern.� My interactions with him that day were limited.�

 

����������� In
his second statement at C236 he writes:

 

�I woke up to V�s stirring at
around 4.10 a.m.� I gave V his dummy and waited until he had settled before
getting back into bed.�

 

Thus he makes no reference to N
getting up.� Then he continues:

 

�I was woken up again by V
whinging about 6.30.� This time I gave him his dummy, but he did not settle.� I
picked V up to comfort him until he had settled.� I then lay him back in his
cot and tucked him up and snuggled up to N in bed.� I woke up at 8.20 a.m. by
my sister texting me.� I replied at about 8.37 a.m.� I stayed in bed and tried
to get a little more sleep, cuddling up to N, but then V started 15 minutes
later.� I figured that since it was close to his morning feed V must have been
hungry.� I got up and picked V up out of his cot and carried him into the front
room.�

 

����������� However,
in evidence G retracted that statement and said that after all he had not got
up at 4 o�clock in the morning.� He said his statement was wrong and he had
instead only got up at 6.30.� When he asserted that he had got up at that time
he said the baby was fine and settled perfectly well after being comforted.�
When further examined, this time by counsel for the child, he changed his mind
once more, indicating that he might after all have got up at 4 o�clock, but
that N had not been awake and she had herself not got up.� 

94.             
It was not
possible to establish from his evidence whether or not the baby was crying or,
as he put it, whinging.� As I have said, he moved between crying a lot (to the
police) to settling in (in his evidence) to whinging (in answer to my
questions).� However, I am satisfied as best I can be that up to 8.37 a.m. that
morning V was not behaving in any unusual fashion.� He was, in my judgment,
stirring and was ready for his morning feed.� 

95.             
I pause.� It
appears to be common ground that N is a heavy sleeper.� Whereas she would wake
up when her baby cried in his cot close to her bed, she would not awaken when
the baby was not in the room, whether he cried or not, nor would the Television
wake her.� At F37, G said this to the police in answer to the question, �Why is
it that you do a lot of the care in the morning?� How�s that?�� He replied:

�Oh, that�s nothing to do with
N.� It�s just I wake up a lot quicker, so I wake up if he moans.� I wake up if
he whinges just once.� I wake up four o�clock in the morning.� It�s just like
having a little whinge.� It�s best if I wake up because she�s a bit of a heavy
sleeper.� She told me many times just to wake her up, but I think obviously
when I started our relationship I still want to be able to get up with him and
help her a little bit and stuff and then obviously wake her up.���� 

 

����������� N
was not best pleased that G would frequently get up and tend to V without
telling her.� She was already becoming slightly anxious that he appeared to be
taking on a role for which she was not ready, but she was quite satisfied that
she had been awake earlier on the morning of 13th September, because
she, rather than V, had not settled.

96.             
Given that
her evidence was maintained and given also that G indicated that his statement
was not correct I prefer her evidence on that particular timeline.� At least
however they both appeared to agree that although V appeared to have woken up
from time to time he was not particularly out of sorts and, on N�s evidence,
fell asleep on her and, on G�s evidence, settled easily with his dummy.

97.             
We then move
to the moment that G got up.� Although I remain dissatisfied with G�s
chronology thereafter � that is from when he picked up the child � it does
appear probable that N remained asleep as G got out of bed.� This, it seems,
was not unusual given the heavy sleeping of which I speak and given her
reported dissatisfaction that he would frequently get up and see to the boy
without waking her.� As I have said, she had complained about that.� It is
reasonably clear therefore that the child was not making a particularly
noticeable complaint, notwithstanding that he might have been hungry and ready
for his food.� N remained asleep and appears by then to have at least
subconsciously accepted that G might feed the baby in the morning.� I am
satisfied that it is entirely probable that had the child been making an
unusual noise or had been crying loudly she would have woken.� She did not.

98.             
G then took
the child into the living room.� At my suggestion a sketch was made of the
floor plan of the flat, from which it is clear that the living room and the
bedroom do not face each other.� There is a wall between them.� G went into the
living room and sat with the child with the television on.� From that moment we
only have his own testimony as to what happened since, as he agrees, N remained
asleep in the bedroom.� For her part N heard or saw nothing until G returned to
the bedroom and placed the baby in his cot.

99.             
In her first
statement at paragraph 94, N says this:

�I woke up to V crying, I presume
for his nine o�clock feed as he was due a bottle.� He was becoming more
distressed and I sat up in bed.� I could see G was leaning over the cot.� I
assumed he was tucking V into his blanket.� Then his crying became louder and
louder.� G picked him up and took him into the living room away from me.� G
then shouted, �Babe, babe,� in a panic.� I rushed out of bed into the living
room to see what was going on.� G was holding V and V couldn�t hold himself and
was flopping in G�s arms.� G seemed panicky and upset.� 

 

����������� N�s
second statement does not touch on the morning of 13th September.�
In her police interview at F85 she says this:

�I woke up.� G was at the cot.�
He was just whinging kind of thing and then he was like tucking him in through
the bars.� I could see he was tucking him in.� He was crying a bit more.� He
took him out of the room and I thought he�s probably crying for a feed kind of
thing.� G said, �Oh, babe,� shouting, kind of worried, so I went running in.�
He was like, �I don�t know what�s happened.�� So he�s like just there and I
leant over him.� He was on the sofa while G was holding him and like trying to
see what�s wrong with him.� He was floppy like he was unconscious.� 

 

����������� In
the interview at F88 N recalls the change in her son�s cry.� �I can just see
him taking him kind of thing and then he�s just freaked out.�� She was asked,
�What do you mean, freaked out?�� �Like he went from a whinge to a kind of very
like ...�� Then she appears to imitate the sound.� �Do you know what I mean?��
Then the questioner: �What, screaming do you mean, or ...� to which N replies,
�It was like more an upbeat cry.� Do you know what I mean, and then all the
rest happened.�� She was asked, �So at the point where you see him tucking him
in and then V starts crying and screaming, what happens then?� What does G
do?�� She replied that G picked him up, went into the living room and in effect
began panicking.� Her responses appeared consistent with the evidence which she
gave to this court.� She said:

�His crying changed.� I checked
the crying on my phone to see if he still needed feeding.� Then he screamed.�
I�ve never heard that cry before.� He was still in his cot.� Then G picked him
up and took him into the living room and then he shouted for me to come.�� 

 

100.         
I am
satisfied that something had happened to the boy to cause that scream.� Within
moments the child appears to have had a seizure and to have then gone floppy,
appearing then to lose consciousness.� I am satisfied certainly to the required
standard that between G picking him up and taking the child from his cot and
then returning the child to his cot the baby was injured.� I quite accept that
I do not know how the injury occurred, save that I have accepted the medical
evidence that there is little doubt that the baby was shaken and the head,
without the baby being able to control it, shook from side to side, rotating
and causing the brain to move within the subdural space, causing vessels to
sheer and bleeds to emerge.� Nor do I know exactly how long the child spent
with G in the living room or, other than that which G has deposed, how the
child moved from place to place in that room, or the manner in which he was
moved.� G asserts that he placed him first on the sofa, then in the baby
bouncer and then back on the sofa before returning him to his cot.� There can
be little doubt save that during the moves he was handled in such a way as to
cause the injuries.� I am satisfied also that the bruise was inflicted at the
same time.� It is entirely likely that it came from a poke or pressure which
was entirely inappropriate.� 

101.         
I consider
that I am entitled to infer a momentary loss of control on G�s part.� There is
ample evidence that he is a young man who is deeply troubled, deeply stressed
and unable from time to time to restrain his outbursts.� That was plain from
his demeanour at the stand and also from the history of the case.� He has, in
my judgment, behaved inappropriately towards two other children, both of tender
years.� He assaulted JN, in my judgment because of his exasperation that the
child had been demanding attention from his aunt.� Thereafter he behaved in the
most cruel fashion both to her and more particularly to the child, obliging the
two of them to remain apart when the child needed comfort.� He assaulted R by
hitting him across the head in a momentary loss of control because of his
irritation that R would not hand over a television remote.� In neither of those
two instances can I find any justification or indeed mitigation for his
behaviour.� He denies the first and excuses his behaviour in relation to the
second.� He revealed to me as his evidence closed that he had been involved in
fist fights, one in which he and his opponent ended up falling over a wall and
the other when he came to blows with a stranger on the street.� Despite his
denials, he clearly has anger issues which are wholly unaddressed, despite
admitting them to his general practitioner and his college counsellor.� 

102.         
It is
entirely probable, in my judgment, on the morning of 13th September
his emotions got the better of him.� He became impatient or exasperated and V
was injured as a result.� The local authority now confidently asserts that he
was the perpetrator and with that submission I respectfully agree.

103.         
This brings
me to the first timeline, which progresses through the two weeks preceding 13th
September when V was presented to hospital and again I have to call once more
on the evidence of the uninformed bystander or parent to inform me as I examine
the child�s presentation.� As we know, the medical witnesses and Dr Chapman in
particular were asked about the presentation of any infant who has suffered
fractures of the nature seen in this case.� What, in simple terms, would be the
consequence of the fractures?� Would he be in pain?� Would he cry out?� Would
that be obvious to the uninformed observer?

104.         
In the joint
meeting Dr Chapman described how the child would have been upset and distressed
and crying, but he added this: �it is possible of course that he was already
distressed and crying and screaming and that may be the thing that actually
caused the perpetrator to commit whatever they did commit�.� All the experts
accepted that the pain would subside in a comparatively short period.� In his
report at E61 Dr Morrell suggested that although the child would continue to
cry for some time, probably up to 30 minutes, (in his evidence before the court
he refined that estimate to closer to 10 minutes), thereafter the distress
would gradually settle.� However, there may be, as he said: �some swelling or
tenderness around the site of the fracture for several days until the fracture
starts to heal�.

105.         
In my
judgment, that is of particular relevance, notwithstanding that none of the
clinicians were pressed on this point, possibly because the lay evidence came
after they had presented their reports to the court.� Some considerable
attention was paid by the advocates to V not settling as well as he had done
hitherto in the two weeks leading up to the admission.� It may be that
initially and until the experts had comprehensively dismissed the assertion,
that it was thought by one or more advocates that a latent brain injury and
consequent irritation was the cause.� I have already found that that was not
the case.� N asserted it was more likely to have been colic and in that she was
supported at least by A and her sister and K.� For my part, having carefully
considered the lay responses and there being no direct medical evidence on the point,
I consider that it is entirely likely that V was suffering from colic, but that
the distress from that discomfort was combining with discomfort from the three
fracture sites each time that he was moved about.� It does not surprise me at
all that �jiggling� the child on K�s knee for example would have not been
calming for the child but uncomfortable, explaining why his efforts to console
the child were unsuccessful.� Whereas the expert analysis of the fractures
accepted that the mechanism of a yank or a twist might be replicated by a child
being pulled up from his cot by an arm, it was also accepted that even the
perpetrator might not recognise immediately that he or she had caused an
injury.� It was also plain from the expert evidence that the leg � that is to
the knee and thigh � injuries would not have occurred on the same occasion as
the shoulder injury, let alone on the same occasion as the head injury; so also
the bruise cannot relate to the same occasion as the metaphyseal fractures.

106.         
The local authority
in its final submissions properly identifies the possibility of both occupants
of the pool being responsible for V�s injuries, which of course would require
one of them to be responsible for the head injury and probably also the bruise
while the other would have caused the metaphyseal fractures.� I regard that, as
both the local authority and the other parties now concede, as being inherently
improbable.� As I have said, the local authority now concludes that the
perpetrator of both injuries was G. �Both G and N did have opportunity to cause
the fractures, but given that I had already found that G was the perpetrator of
the injury to V�s brain and given that in so doing I recorded my anxiety about
G�s lack of control, it appears to be inherently improbable that V has been the
victim of assaults by both of the adults closest to him and that the
perpetrator is likely to be the same in respect of both sets of injury.� There
is no doubt but that G has had the opportunity and in particular had the opportunity
for example on 27th August when AG arrived in his doorway and
observed that he had just completed the task of changing the baby.� According
to AG, the baby was presenting normally.� Given the medical evidence which I
have heard it is possible that, firstly, the injuries could well have occurred
at around that date and, secondly, that after initial severe discomfort the
child would settle and, as a result, not only would the perpetrator possibly be
not aware of the insult, but an uninformed bystander equally would not be aware
that anything was amiss.

107.         
I cannot be
certain that any of the fractures were inflicted on 27th August, but
on the balance of probability I am satisfied that the perpetrator was not N.� 

108.         
Therefore, in
summary I accede to and record the local authority�s submission that K could
not be identified as a perpetrator of any of V�s injuries, nor did she fail to
protect the child from the hands of the perpetrator.� I also accept the local
authority�s submission that N was not the perpetrator. �I find that the local
authority has made out its case to the required standard that the perpetrator
was G.

109.         
I therefore
have to move on to the closing submission of the local authority that N failed
to protect her child from the risk of harm presented by G.� I consider that
this can be dealt with shortly.� I have not been invited by the local authority
to consider the parenting assessment undertaken by Alison Johnson and therefore
at this stage I am unaware of the strength or contents of that untested assessment.�
However, it was put to N compellingly that she has a blind spot when it comes
to relationships.� With that assertion I agree.� The fact of the matter is that
she was and remains a vulnerable young woman.� She has had the grave misfortune
to have been abused horribly by the baby�s father, but she, like he, has
candidly accepted that she should have parted from him earlier than she did.�
Nonetheless it must be accepted that she did part from him and indeed that she
ejected him from her accommodation. �She should, however, have been more alert
to G�s behaviour.� It was, as ST said in her evidence, controlling.� K also
recognised that, as did the family nurse, but N, while seeing the signals, did
not read them.� She did not recognise just how unhealthy were the obsessive
demands of G or how troubling were his headlong attempts to secure her within a
tight family unit.� At the stand, in her words, she accepted that she should
have run for the hills.� However, she did not.� What was it that she could identify?�
Certainly G�s obsessive behaviour was unhealthy and was increasingly
uncomfortable.� Nonetheless she was carrying through her intention to move to
Valley House.� Also from the medical evidence it was plain that she might not
have known about the fractures to her child�s limbs and indeed in my judgment
she did not since I have found that she was not the perpetrator.� I am quite
satisfied that had she seen G behaving inappropriately she would have acted
immediately.� Naturally, as soon as the baby went to hospital she knew or ought
to have known that the child had suffered a calamity and it should not have
taken her very long to conclude that by a process of elimination the
perpetrator had to be G, but on objective analysis, she did not thereafter fail
to protect her baby since he had, from his arrival in hospital, not been in her
care.

110.         
Therefore, I
am a little troubled at the suggestion that I should find that she has actively
failed to protect the baby despite her unwise continuation of her relationship with
G for a matter of some days after the hospital admission is made out.� Whether
or not she should be forgiven for not realising what was in fact inevitable
until the passage of the following weeks rather than the hours following the
admission to hospital, there is little doubt that at the very least she does
require assistance and education to avoid a similar calamity occurring in the
future.� However, as this case proceeds and as the local authority offers the
assistance which N clearly does need, I doubt that she should be parted from
her baby during that exercise.

End of judgment.���

IMPORTANT NOTICE





HHJ Wildblood QC : 

This is an extremely sad case. Ten months ago a now sixteen year old mother with an IQ of 68 gave birth to a son whilst living at home with her dysfunctional family following the separation of her parents. She says that the birth arose from an act of rape by a lodger, the father of the child (who denies rape and has absented himself from the child's life). The mother, who was aged 14 at the time of the conception, loves her son with all the natural love that any parent could hold and he has remained in her care since birth, most recently under interim care orders. However, despite a truly exceptional level of services that the Local Authority has provided, the view of all those who have assessed the mother is that she cannot offer her son the care that he needs, even with an exceptional level of support, and that the only solution for the child is adoption. 

 

Recognising as I do the intense pain that that solution would cause to this mother and her family and also the natural and legal need of a child to be brought up within a natural family unless there is genuinely no other solution (supported or otherwise) to meet his welfare, I have spent a long time examining this case to see if a thread can be weaved through it which, consistent with the child's paramount welfare, would allow for a solution that would leave this boy in the care of his mother. In this long judgment I set out the background to the case, the evidence that I have heard, the agreed legal considerations, my analysis and then my conclusions.

 

Introduction � The Local Authority is Gloucestershire County Council. It seeks care and placement orders in relation to the boy concerned. He is C, who is ten months old, having been born on 3rd May 2013. The mother of C, 'MM' (born on 30th December 1997 and therefore now aged 16), opposes the Local Authority's applications and wishes to continue to care for C; she and C currently live at the home of her father, DM, in 'Town', Gloucestershire. 

 

C's father, FF (born on 6th July 1994 and therefore aged 19) has filed a position statement in which he acknowledges that he cannot care for C and expresses his support for the position of Ms M; he has not taken up available contact with C (saying that he could not travel from his home in City to 'Another Town' for that contact), has not attended previous court hearings (and only attended this hearing on the first day) but hopes that he would be able to arrange for contact to take place by arrangement with Ms M. He says that C was born as a result of consensual intercourse between himself and Ms M. The issue of the rape allegation was not litigated before me. 

 

The guardian, Pravina Gulabivala, supports the Local Authority and, in her final report dated 19th February 2014 [E16], recommends that care and placement orders should be made. At E25 she said that 'Ms M is not able to care for her son to a good enough standard. C would therefore continue to experience physical and emotional neglect, he is likely to continue to experience developmental delay. The cumulative impact of this would be that C would not be able to reach his developmental milestones and fulfil his potential'.

 

A clinical psychologist, Ms Beverley Fidell, assessed Ms M as having a Full Scale IQ of 68 [E9] but concluded that she does have mental capacity to instruct her solicitor [E13]. At E12 she suggested that Ms M's 'abilities are likely to remain within the exceptionally low or borderline range of intelligence'.

 

Another clinical psychologist, Dr Grace Tantam, was instructed on the mother's application and does not support the mother's position. Dr Tantam says: 'her difficulties mean that her relationships are complex and generally unsatisfactory, and she has a very limited capacity to reflect upon and understand emotions, especially as they occur within relationship dynamics. Her limited capacity to reflect, as well as her na�ve and often concrete thinking, limit her capacity to protect C from the very real risks in his current environment. There is also a significant impact upon her capacity to engage with professionals and to take the advice that they give and implement it in a variety of situations over time'. Dr Tantam gave sensitive, firm and clear oral evidence to the effect that Ms M could not care for C adequately.

 

This is a case where every assessment that has been conducted within a wide range of professionals has concluded that C cannot remain with this mother consistently with his welfare despite there having been an exceptionally high level of support for the family. The two social workers (Ms Coward and Ms Gilder, both of whom gave professional and considered evidence), the guardian and Dr Tantam have all carried out separate assessments and are all of the same view. Ms HV, who has been the health visitor for C since shortly after his birth and who was involved in discussions about the orders sought by the Local Authority, supports it in its applications. Her evidence was professional, carefully considered and kind. Ms CS (who carried out a 'PAMs' assessment of Ms M and also gave careful and considered evidence), identified very basic areas in which Ms M could not provide adequate care for C [C80].

 

The Local Authority contends that Ms M is an 'immature, vulnerable and na�ve' mother of exceptionally low or borderline range of intelligence who has not been able to demonstrate an ability to care for C since his birth either with or without the support of her family and who has not been able to develop her parenting abilities despite the large amount of professional input. The social worker's statement at C134 suggests that: i) C is living in cluttered and unhygienic home; ii) Ms M 'struggles' to adhere to advice and, for instance,  gives C junk food; iii) Ms M 'struggles' to provide emotional warmth and stimulation to C; iv) Ms M does not meet C's health needs consistently (for instance, did not attend some follow up appointments for his lactose intolerance); v) Ms M's family members are hostile to and aggressive towards social workers, making it difficult to engage with them (Ms M herself says at C153 that she has found the social workers and the health visitor difficult to get on with suggesting that they 'talk down to her'; vi)  assessments suggest that she is unable to sustain the care of C; vii) there are no family members who can care for C or sufficiently support Ms M in her care of him; viii) despite a very high level of support offered to the family during the interim period of this case 'the concerns of the Local Authority have not been mitigated'.

 

After C's birth Ms M and C lived together in a mother and baby foster home of XX (whose statement is at C244) but, the Local Authority contends, the mother did not maintain her initial co-operation with that arrangement, began to leave C with the foster carers for an inappropriate amount of time and decided not to remain after 12 weeks (although it has to be said that the foster carer's statement does not read as being particularly critical of the mother, which is perhaps not surprising given the mother's age and the foster carer's knowledge of the diffcilties that she has faced). 

 

On 30th July 2013 Ms M moved with C to live with her cousin, YY but, the Local Authority contends, did not care for C adequately and, in particular, demonstrated aggressive resentment towards him. The relationship between Ms M and YY broke down for reasons that were not litigated before me. The Local Authority intended to carry out a viability assessment of whether YY could care for C; however, before the assessment could be completed, Ms Y withdrew her request to be considered as a carer for C [C135].

 

On 2nd September 2013 Ms M left the home of YY and went to live with C at the home of her father, D M. A written agreement was drawn up about the arrangements that would be in place there and a high level of supervision by the Local Authority was provided (involving visits on 1 to 3 times a day by safeguarding workers). The original agreement is at C42; the terms of the agreement were tightened up in January 2014 and are at C104. That later agreement was made after the Local Authority had applied at an interim hearing to remove C from Ms M but, faced with the guardian suggesting that the issues should be litigated at a proximate final hearing, did not proceed to argue for interim removal. However, the Local Authority contends that the agreements were not respected by the mother and that her care of C was inadequate. 

 

Options � At the outset of this hearing I asked that the contended options for disposal should be identified. With the help of the advocates, for which I am grateful, it was made clear that each of the parties (including the guardian) agreed that there are only two realistic options before the court:

 

i)	That C should continue in the care of Ms M with the help of her family and, if thought appropriate, a supervision order;

ii)	That C should be made subject to care and placement orders.

Thus there is no suggestion that, in relation to this ten month old child, long term fostering represents a sensible or realistic option. Further, there is no suggestion that any third party (e.g. a member of either family or a friend) might care for C in the event that Ms M does not; thus there is no suggestion of what is sometimes called 'kinship' care. There was no suggestion that the case might be adjourned for further assessment (since there is an abundance of evidence that is now available).

 

These proceedings - These proceedings were started on 10th September 2013 by which time C was four months old. Interim care orders, under which C has remained with Ms M, have been in place since 17th September 2013, which is the date upon which District Judge Watkins conducted the case management hearing. On 15th January 2014 HHJ Marston gave directions at a hearing in which the Local Authority sought to remove C from the mother's care against the recommendation of the guardian; the guardian recommended that the case needed to be listed for an urgent final hearing. It is following this hearing that the second agreement was made. The agreement contains 16 paragraphs which include that '�GGMH and/or A M to be present at all times when D M is at work�B M is not to have any contact with C M nor to be in the same property as C M�M is not to be left alone with C at any time�.C is not to be left in the care of anyone (including GGMH) other than MM, DM or appropriate professionals�FF is not to have any direct or indirect contact with C M, save as arranged and supervised by the Local Authority�The unannounced visits are to continue and will consist of between 1 and 3 visits per day�'.  The fact that Ms M could not be left alone with C under that agreement reinforces the exceptional level of supervision and monitoring that has been in place.

 

HHJ Marston listed the case before HHJ Rutherford on 24th February 2014 for an IRH and on 27th February 2014 for final hearing with a time estimate of two days.

 

At that IRH on 24th February 2014 HHJ Rutherford adjourned the final hearing until 20th March 2014 on the basis that the time estimate of two days was inadequate due to the proposed number of witnesses [B113C]. He gave further directions on 27th February 2014 in which he recorded that threshold was in dispute and there needed to be a more particularised threshold document [B113B]. He recorded that the Local Authority and guardian both recommended that care and placement orders should be made, a course of action that the mother disputed (the father did not appear and was not represented). He also recorded that a number of family members had been identified as potential carers and that 'the court explained to [the parents] that any persons identified�may not be assessed due to the delay not being consistent with the timetable for the child. The persons identified by the mother are YY (maternal cousin), D M (maternal grandfather) and GM M (maternal grandmother). The person identified by the father is Jacqueline F (paternal great aunt)'. He also gave the mother permission to obtain a report from Dr Grace Tantam, clinical psychologist. He gave various other directions.

 

The suggestion that there were other potential carers who wished to be assessed had also evaporated by the time of this hearing. So, too, had the perceived issues about threshold. Nothing like the suggested number of witnesses gave evidence before me. Far from narrowing the issues, the IRH expanded them dramatically in a way that proved unnecessary.

 

Threshold � Following the hearing before HHJ Rutherford the Local Authority filed particularised threshold criteria, as ordered by the court and requested by the other parties, in a document that extended to seven pages and contained ten main paragraphs and 38 sub paragraphs [A22]. That hardly represents the sort of document that was intended by the 'new Public Law Outline' and the less said about it now the better (I do not criticise the Local Authority or author of the document in any way since they were ordered to file it). At the start of this hearing counsel helpfully produced a much shorter document which records the agreed terms in which the criteria in section 31(2) of The Children Act 1989 are fulfilled. I approved that document.

 

The essential part of the current threshold document read: 'The parents agree that the threshold for making public law orders in this case is met pursuant to Section 31 (2) Children Act 1989. The agreed threshold criteria are as set out below. Agreed Threshold Criteria: At the time when protective measures were taken the child C M (born 03:05:2014) was suffering or was likely to suffer significant harm and that harm, or likelihood of harm, was attributable to the care given to him, or likely to be given to him if an order were not made, not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give him.

 

i)	M is a vulnerable young mother (aged 15 at the time of C's birth) who has herself had a difficult upbringing and was the subject of a child protection plan as a child.

ii)	Before proceedings were issued C had been in 3 different placements.

iii)	M alleges she was raped by C's father F F yet there is evidence to suggest that she maintained contact with him.

iv)	M and C live with maternal grandfather and professionals have observed the home at times to be cluttered and unhygienic.

v)	M's relationship with her family can be volatile at times and M's brother B has physically harmed M in the past and presents a risk to C.

vi)	M's care of C can be inconsistent as a result of her immaturity and lack of parenting experience and she sometimes needs prompting to meet his needs.

vii)	Professionals have at times observed a lack of interaction between C and M and also expressed concern about her handling of C.

viii)	M has struggled to engage with certain professionals and M and became angry and frustrated, and sometimes in front of C.

ix)	The psychologist Dr. Grace Tantam has reported on 14:03:2014 (at E27) and as part of her executive summary described mother as a "very vulnerable parent and she experienced a range of difficulties both cognitive and emotional" and Dr. Tantam concluded (para 1.4) that mother could not provide for C's need for permanence and safety within his timescales.

x)	The father, FF, does not put himself forward as a carer for C neither has he attended any contact with C.

I approved that threshold document and so the focus of this hearing has been on welfare issues alone. Governing the welfare issues is the jurisprudence of Re B [2013] UKSC 33 that C should not be deprived of the right to an upbringing with his mother unless, as a last resort, there are exceptional circumstances demonstrating that no other solution compatible with his welfare is available. Of the dicta in Re B the President said in Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146: 'The language used in Re B is striking. Different words and phrases are used, but the message is clear. Orders contemplating non-consensual adoption � care orders with a plan for adoption, placement orders and adoption orders � are "a very extreme thing, a last resort", only to be made where "nothing else will do", where "no other course [is] possible in [the child's] interests", they are "the most extreme option", a "last resort � when all else fails", to be made "only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare, in short, where nothing else will do": see Re B paras 74, 76, 77, 82, 104, 130, 135, 145, 198, 215 [22]'.

 

The care plan is at D16 and proposes that C should be placed with prospective adopters. It suggests that the parents should have letterbox contact [D18]. At C140 the Local Authority social worker, Joanne Gilder, proposes that C should move from the mother's care to a 'bridging placement'  whilst prospective adopters are found.

 

Services � This is a case where there has been a truly exceptional level of interim services and assessment. The interim services have included the following:

 

i)	Ms Gilder (social worker) � weekly visits;

ii)	HH, health visitor, fortnightly visits;

iii)	KK, nursery nurse � fortnightly;

iv)	'CJ, youth support worker � weekly;

v)	RR, Family Support worker of the Z Centre � weekly.

vi)	MM, Family Support worker � each Monday and alternate Wednesdays;

vii)	X Nursery (Tuesdays);

viii)	Welfare visits by the Countywide Contact team � between once and three-times a day. 

The unanimous view of all professionals who have assessed this young mother is that she is unable to care for C adequately even with that very high level of support and the support of her family. Ms M loves C and desperately wants to care for him but, it is said, is simply unable to do so. This is, therefore, an utterly miserable case to hear. There is no doubt whatsoever that Gloucestershire County Council has provided as many services as it could possibly be expected to offer. Those services having been available in the past, there is no reason to suppose that they could not be provided in the future. I do not think that I could be more fully informed about services. The point that is made by the Local Authority witnesses and by the guardian is that, notwithstanding the array of services that have been and could be made available, there is no realistic prospect of this mother being able to care for C in a way that is consistent with his welfare. There is no issue about the availability of services.

 

The Local Authority � It was first involved with Ms M from 17th December 2007 until 11th March 2008 when she was subject to a child protection plan as it was considered her welfare was being neglected. Her brother B had been subject to a similar plan for 9 months in 2006 and again from 27th December 2007 until 26th February 2009; B received support from learning disability services, is said to have been neglected by his family and has behavioural difficulties that cause him to become agitated and volatile [e.g. H125].

 

On the 26th September 2012 a referral was made to Children's Services by Ms M's school, LB School, after she had complained that her brother B had hurt her physically and also because of her poor school attendance (she had not been to school since term started). She was then aged 14 and must have been pregnant by then also. She had apparently posted on Facebook a photograph of bruises that she alleged had been caused by B. It is about this time that her parents separated and, of course, Mr F came to live with the family. 

 

As a result of the referral from the school, the Local Authority became involved with Ms M and created a child protection plan for her which was in existence from December 2012 until March 2013.

 

The Local Authority planned for the birth by holding a case conference on 4th February 2013 and a child protection plan was made due to  concerns that C would be neglected [C6]. Arrangements were made in April 2013 (a month before the birth) for C and Ms M to move to the mother and baby foster placement after the birth. 

 

In August 2013, prior to the issue of proceedings, the Local Authority social worker, Jennifer Coward, carried out a core assessment of the mother [C11]; it concluded as follows:

 



'M is a fifteen year old girl who is the mother of a three month old baby. M presents as immature, and has been observed to demonstrate immature behaviours � such as stomping off and locking herself in the bedroom when given advice or asked to do something. Numerous concerns have been raised by various professionals such as health visitor, nursery nurse, children's centre, and children's services. Concerns have also been raised by both foster carers. These concerns all relate to M's care of C and include M's rough handling of C, not communicating with him whilst feeding, dressing or changing, not ensuring his head is supported, even after advice and leavings C to prop feed himself.





�.M appears not to be interacting with C and does not appear to be aware of how important it is that she does interact with C. M has not been talking to C when feeding him or changing his nappy. It is concerning that even after being prompted by the nursery nurse and health visitor, M still did not interact with C and how important it is, however M does not appear to be putting this knowledge in to her care of C.





Concerns have also been raised regarding M's ability to ensure C's safety, this was demonstrated as M allowed C to be taken to her grandmother's by a ten year old female.





..Concerns have also been raised in relation to M being quite verbally aggressive towards C, shouting at him and even on occasions swearing at him.





�.Given the seriousness of these recent concerns and that C is only three months old, a legal planning meeting will be arranged with a view to securing a long term placement for C'.



However, in September an agreement was entered into between Ms M, DM and the Local Authority by which Mr M reduced his work hours and Ms M lived at his home with C. It was at that point that the very heavy level of supervision began as, indeed, did these proceedings. 

 

The social worker, Ms Coward, filed a further statement in October 2013 in which she said at C29: 'In conclusion the Local Authority remains very concerned about C's emotional presentation. He has presented as detached and avoiding eye contact due to both M and her father raising their voices and being verbally aggressive, as detailed in the health visitor's records'.

 

The health visitor, HH, had started visiting Ms M on 10th June 2013. In her statement at C38J she said: 'My analysis, based on my observations of Ms M' care of C is that Miss M is inconsistent in her ability to meet C's physical and emotional needs. At times she is so overwhelmed by her own emotions that she appears unaware of limited skills of containment (the ability to receive and understand the needs of C) or reciprocity (the ability to actively develop her interactions and become more attuned with C). It is possible that Miss M could develop these skills but her inconsistent engagement with professionals and the lack of positive role models around her, make this less likely'.

 

A 'PAMs' assessment of the mother was carried out by a social worker, Ms CS and was written on 19th December 2013 [C68]. 'PAMs' stands for an assessment based on the parenting assessment manual developed by the clinical psychologist, Dr Sue McGaw (who often used to give respected evidence in proceedings in Truro when I was at the bar); it is used nationally. The results are summarised by Ms CS at C80 and by the guardian at E21 where she says: 'The PAMS assessment concluded that Ms M needs immediate high priority work to be undertaken across 25% of 135 skills assessed. The priority work which needs to be undertaken immediately is in the area of feeding, stimulation, parental responsiveness, general household cleanliness, hygiene and so on. The assessment also highlighted 26% of skills identified as medium priority to be undertaken in the next four to eight weeks. Overall it was concluded that Ms M needed input either immediately or in the next four to eight weeks in 51% of skills. The assessment concluded that the level of need was high especially as it came after eight months of intensive support, guidance and advice. The assessment concluded that further work be undertaken with Ms M within tight time constraints, and if the work is not competed then alternative plans would have to be made for C'.

 

The report of Ms CS included the following passages at C80 and C81:

 



'Across the total 135 worksheets skills which have been assessed and described in this report, 25% are identified as High Priority Rating 3 (teaching required immediately). These skills are in the areas of 'feeding, child's healthcare hygiene, child's healthcare warmth, parental responsiveness, development: stimulation visual, development: stimulation language, household routines, shopping, cooking, washing, hygiene in the kitchen/living room, hygiene in the bathroom, general safety, safety in the kitchen/living room, environment and community. There are 26% of skills identified as being of medium priority rating 2 (teaching recommended in 4 � 8 weeks). Also there are 29% of skills identified as being of low priority rating 1 (teaching required in the future). Finally 20% of skills were assessed as criterion reached. Overall, M M requires 51% of skills to be taught either immediately or in the next 4-8 weeks across all the areas assessed.





M is a lone parent that has been assessed by a clinical psychologist. The assessment found that M's literacy skills as limited due to her poor school attendance; her reading age was seven years and nine months, although her numeracy skills were sound. Her IQ score falls exceptionally law and her verbal score was also exceptionally low, there was some variation in her subtexts scores and her weakest score point is measure and non-verbal reasoning. It was found that M could communicate clearly and effectively [but] her verbal reasoning skills are restricted.





When on task M is a loving mother but becomes quite distracted very easily. Her organisational skills are poor and she will need support around this and the importance of keeping appointments with health professionals. M is currently living at home with her father who provides the majority of support, alongside her Nan�.





Recommendations - Out of 13 areas M has scored a priority rating 3 in 9 of them, this is a high level of need. M has already had 8 months of intensive support including a foster placement. The work that is recommended in the teaching points needs to be prioritised and have tight time constraints in which they are completed for C's safety and emotional wellbeing. If the work is not completed then social care need to re-consider where C should live to ensure that his needs are met, not just in the immediate future.





In the past M has not made a good attitude towards taking advice from professionals this will have to change for her to make any progress. M needs to realise that to provide C with an environment that is conducive to his development and emotional needs she needs to listen to professionals and act upon their advice. M's family need to support her with this...The Health Visitor and Family Support worker to continue to monitor C's development and to provide guidance with regard to feeding, general health and symptom recognition / responses. M also needs to understand the importance of looking after herself emotionally as well as physically'.



In oral evidence Ms CS said that areas identified as being within high priority rating number 3 are very important to parenting. If one looks at the list of areas identified it is not surprising that Ms CS said this.

 

An example of the difficulties suggested in the report of Ms CS is at C74 where she said: 'M could not describe the right order for preparing a bottle, during the observation she complained about the bottle being greasy. M seems very distracted when feeding C and often loses interest with what she is doing early on in the process; she does not encourage C to eat his food and often leaves half a bowl of food because she has not persevered�.[C75]�M mentioned that the bottles were greasy and tried to clean it off with a wet wipe. In the parent booklet M was able to describe that she knew how to change a nappy, when being observed she was not able to follow this and did not wash her hands or dispose of the nappy in a safe way�Most of the time M did not raise her voice, although in one observation she became quite cross and shouted while C was in front of her. There are other adults in the home who have raised voices quite loud around C'. As to the raised voices, Ms CS said that her experience was that it is not that the family members shouted at each other but that they had loud voices and the television was turned up to a high volume; it is a very noisy household, she said. 

 

What I did not hear from any of the questioning of Ms CS during oral evidence was how the 'rating' that was given to this mother as part of this PAMs assessment transported into the questions that I have to consider in accordance with Re B [2013] UKSC 33 and Re W [2013] EWCA Civ 1227. I therefore raised this with the advocates.

 

The social worker, Ms Gilder, therefore returned to the witness box to say how the assessment was considered by the Local Authority. Not surprisingly, she said that the PAMs assessment highlighted the concerns that the Local Authority already had. She said that she had considered the PAMs assessment when making her recommendations. Although Ms M has made some improvements on the issues raised in the assessment, they have not been consistent and the advice that the mother has been given has not been implemented. The assessment 'was a case of confirming what the Local Authority already knew', she said.

 

In December 2013 the Local Authority continued to express its concerns about the care that C was receiving. Ms Coward filed a statement contending that Ms M was not co operating with professional involvement. Further, there were particular concerns about the presence of B, Ms M's brother, at the house. During a visit by the social worker on 11th December 2013, B was seen to be behaving aggressively towards his grandmother and to be agitated. He had been arrested on 5th December 2013 for assaulting his grandmother (she had gone to hit him with a pan, apparently and he responded to her violently in what was referred to at this hearing as the 'pan incident'). At C74 there is an account of B having thrown a glass bottle at his sister A.  At H89 there is this description of B in the home on the day in question, 18th November 2013: 'B was talking to M very loudly as he sat on the floor rolling himself a cigarette. He was talking about 'beating up' someone and 'breaking their neck'. GGM told him several times to stop but he just laughed and carried on. GGM commented, 'He's been like it all day'. A said B had thrown a glass bottle at her earlier 'messing about'. No one was engaging with C'.

 

Ms Coward said, at C63, that C was living in an environment in which there was a lot of verbal aggression within the family as a whole. At C65 she suggested that C should be removed from Ms M and placed with foster carers.

 

However that application was not pursued and the tighter family agreement was made, which included that B was not to be present in the home and was not to have contact with C. Following the hearing before HHJ Rutherford the report of Dr Grace Tantam was received which also mirrored the Local Authority's reasoning as to why C cannot remain with his mother.

 

Enclosure H  - This enclosure of the court bundle contains the many pages of documentation prepared by the Countywide Contact team. I have read that enclosure and summarise its contents in this way:

 

i)	Countywide workers were accepted into the house.

ii)	Their work involved recording observations of C, the condition of the house and the interaction between family members. This was safeguarding work and not assessment. It was no part of the team to challenge or advise the family.

iii)	C was generally smiling, adequately dressed and gave the appearance of being happy.

iv)	The condition of the house was often cluttered and grubby but not squalid.

v)	There was no consistent observation of poor interaction within the family although there were times when there was obvious tension.

vi)	On occasions there were outbursts of ill-temper by D M (e.g. H3, H30, H60, H162, H166 and H207) but, on the whole, he co-operated with Countywide.

vii)	There were some reports of positive interaction between the mother and C (e.g. H7, H31, H69, H238, H241, H243, etc) and also some negative (e.g. H9, H89, H105, H141, H152). In the main, however, the recordings do not purport to asses the quality of interaction between the mother and C. 

The guardian gives her summary of that evidence from Countywide in this way: 'Daily welfare checks were also undertaken of Ms M and C. The welfare checks reveal at times, positive observations of Ms M and her care of C. When on task, she is observed to be focussed and attuned to the needs of C. The observations also highlight the erratic nature of Ms M's care of C. Ms M can become easily distracted and lose focus with C. She does not persist with feeding him. Although she offers him toys, she does not follow this through with actively engaging in playing with him. C therefore does not know what to do with the toys and loses interest. Ms M is also not able to consistently stimulate C by talking and singing to him; this is a critical aspect of language development'. 

 

Ms M - There is a very helpful genogram of her family at C1. The family lives in close proximity in Local Authority housing on 'A' Road in Town (Gloucestershire); her sister, brother and grandmother (GGM H) live two doors away from the home where Ms M, D M and C live. Apparently A is the carer of GGM H [C156]. 

 

A more distant figure in this case is the mother of Ms M, GMM. There is a 'viability assessment' of her at C106. She and D M separated in October 2012, at which time FF was living in the house.  She lives with a PP in a one bedroom council flat on a busy road and is trying to arrange for a move to a different property in Gloucester. She and Mr P receive benefits, smoke and have two kittens in the flat [C107]. The assessment includes, in the penultimate paragraph: 'Although Mrs M has shown a willingness to care for C, it is concerning that Mrs M has not played an active part in supporting her daughter since the birth of C. Mrs M did not engage with children's services and was not available for pre arranged visits at the beginning of the year when it was identified that M was pregnant. Mrs M own children have all been made subject to child protection plans under the category of neglect'.

 

MM's sister, AM, was born on 13th September 1992 and has filed a statement at C243A. A says that she sees Ms M nearly every day and supports her in her wish to care for C. A says that she would work with professionals and thinks that M M (the mother) is a good mum [C243b].

 

The case began on the understanding that Ms M and Mr F had severed their relationship and were on poor terms. The disputed allegation of rape was symbolic of that understanding. However, on the second day of the hearing Mr Farquarson informed the court, as he was duty bound to do, of instructions that he had received from his client. They were that Ms M had informed him that she and Mr F had met recently, had come to City together with C and had spent time together there with Mr F's parents that day before she and C returned to Town. Ms M accepted that she had concealed this information from her father. Not surprisingly, I was told that this information was distressing for D M to hear. Further, that contact amounted to a clear breach of both agreements (at C104 and C42).

 

B M, M's brother, was born on 6th January 1996. The guardian says as follows about him at E22: 'The Local Authority has been also concerned about the presence of B; Ms M's older brother. B has a learning disability and his behaviour has been of concern; he can be aggressive and volatile. His presence in the home became even more of a concern after he was arrested on 5th December 2013 for assaulting Ms H; maternal grandmother. He was advised to reside at his mother's address but he has not done this. Although discussions have been undertaken about the risks of B being around C, the family have failed to take on board concerns; Ms M left C with Ms H and B on 11th December 2013; B was observed to be agitated and aggressive'. 

 

The Local Authority alleges that the agreement of 9th January (which provided that 'B M is not to have any contact with C M nor to be in the same property as C M') was not respected by the family and that B was present in the home with C on a number of occasions after it; Ms M denies that he has been. The evidence is insufficient to substantiate the Local Authority's case on this point and, since the burden of proof rests on the Local Authority, the allegation falls by the wayside as being without substance. The evidence would certainly not survive a direction given in accordance with R v Turnbull [1977] Q.B. 224.

 

Ms M's last statement is at C152. In it she said that she would intend that she and C should remain living with her father. However, her brief oral evidence was not to the same effect. Initially, she said that her relationship with her dad was alright and that they sometimes fall out and do not speak to each other - sometimes he shouts at her and it makes her really upset. She then said that she does not have a good relationship with her dad and that she is not sure where she will live in the future. She just wants to 'live on her own with C as far away from everyone as she can; with her sister or someone like that'.

 

She is working with a CJ on the 'Parents with Prospects Programme'. She began to work with CJ before the birth, there was then a gap for a few months and then (from December 2013) weekly visits were arranged at the Z Centre; this work is still continuing. In her statement CJ says at C122: 'Whenever I have seen C, he has been appropriately and well dressed and of clean appearance�[C123]�M obviously cares for C and enthusiastically shows items of clothing she has brought for C. I have witnessed her hold C, however the majority of time within my visits, M has been comfortable to leave C within his bouncer chair or perhaps move to his walker, although I acknowledge it would be difficult for M to care for C and complete written tasks�.on some visits to the family home, the environment has felt cold, although C has been dressed well. The general condition of the home environment has varied, generally appearing very untidy and cluttered with limited space. Family members have been friendly, although on occasions heated discussions between family members and opinions of social care have been voiced making it difficult to engage M in planned tasks and perhaps detrimental to my efforts to encourage M to engage with services and support offered. ..M remains happy to engage on a regular basis and continue to complete Parents with Prospects training on 1 : 1 basis and give further consideration to joining the group help at the Z Centre with support'. I was told that, initially after the PAMs assessment Ms M did not wish to participate with the support of the Children's Centre.

 

Ms M says that she would like to continue to work with KK (who is a community nursery nurse working under the supervision of the heath visitor, HH and who has filed a statement at C193). She attended a Young Mum's to be course before C's birth and continued to attend after the birth but did so only sporadically; there is a statement from a LL at C148 which, for the purpose of this hearing, has little evidential value. Her involvement with that course ended in October 2013 [C151] when Ms M began to work with Ms RR from the Town Children's centre. 

 

Ms RR has filed two statements (C65a and C124) which are not well drafted (as they do not give any overall summary) but read as though they are not critical of the mother's general care of C (she refers to C being clean and of Ms M being engaged); she also refers to one incident when C banged his head and Ms M was prompted to give him a cuddle [C187].

 

Ms M says that she has found the current social worker Jo Gilder and the previous social worker Jennifer Coward very difficult to work with. She says that she and her father have ensured that her disruptive brother, B (born on 6th January 1996), is not allowed to come to her father's home [C154] and that she and her father have worked hard to improve the conditions within the home. The picture emerged very clearly that when people simply observe Ms M or her father, there is no sustained hostility from Ms or Mr M; however if advice is given or if either Ms M or D M are challenged, they find it very difficult indeed to accept the advice or challenge and resentment emerges.

 

Ms M ends her statement by saying at C156: 'I ideally want C to be able to remain at home living with me. I understand that I will need to have ongoing support both from my family and also other people and I am prepared to accept this. My father is willing to continue with his part time hours so that he can be at home to support me as he has done during these proceedings. My Nan is really helpful and someone I can talk to and get support emotionally. She has a wealth of experience and similarly I am able to talk to my mother. My sister A comes round every day. She lives with my Nan and is her carer. She is 21 years old and has no children of her own. She is also able to continue to support me. I do not believe that it is right for C to be removed from my care. I am a young mum and I know that I do have things still to learn. My relationship with my father is good and there have been times when we have not seen eye to eye but we are managing much better and if we do not agree on something or say something that the other does not like we do not shout at each other�I very much want to be able to continue to look after C and bring him up within my family and believe that with the support that be put in place and continue, I am able to do this'. Her oral evidence, as I have stated, was somewhat different to this.

 

Mr F � He lives in City with his parents, S F and K T and his younger sister KKF. Arrangements were made for him to have supervised contact with C but he did not keep to them [C116]. There is a very poor relationship between Mr F and the members of Ms M's family (which is not surprising given that the allegation of rape arises from a time when Mr F had been given a home with the M).

 

A report by Anglia DNA, dated 28th November 2013, confirmed that Mr F is C's father. The Local Authority carried out an assessment of Mr F and in the resultant report dated 16th January 2014, it concluded that it would not support Mr F being considered as a carer of C [C115-119].

 

He has appeared before the magistrates court on three occasions (all during the past six months � i.e. since 5th September 2013). On the 5th September 2013 he appeared for two public order offences and received a community sentence. On 6th December 2013 he appeared for racially/ religiously aggravated harassment and a further public order offence; he received a further community sentence which was made more onerous on 2nd January 2014 for breach.

 

Mr F's father, S F, and his partner Mrs K T initially put themselves forward as potential carers of C but then withdrew, apparently stating that they 'did not want anything to do with C' [C133]. On 10th January 2014 Ms T told Ms Coward (social worker) that 'no family members wanted anything to do with C' and, further, Ms T expressed surprise that, at the time, Mr F was expressing a wish to care for C himself [C116]. Other family members have been assessed but are not supported by the Local Authority as carers of C; none of them have put themselves forward as carers of C.

 

D M:  D M, the maternal grandfather of C, is aged 46 having been born on 11th November 1967. He used to be married to Ms M's mother, GM M. He works as a coach driver for 25 - 30 hours each week (he was working 55 hours a week prior to the time when M and C came to live with him). He filed a statement at C157 and gave oral evidence. He stresses the support that he would wish to offer Ms M. He says that the conditions within the home have improved as a result of their 'huge effort to tidy the home and de-clutter it'.

 

The Local Authority carried out an assessment of whether he should be considered as a separate carer for C. The assessment at C35 by Ms Jennifer Coward, concluded at C37 that 'It is recommended that Mr M is not suitable to be further assessed as an alternative carer for C. Mr M own child have all themselves been subject to child protection plans in the past. Mr M allowed a male whom he thought was in a relationship with M (then aged 14) to live in his home which resulted in M making the allegation that this male raped her resulting in this pregnancy. Mr M has also demonstrated inappropriate behaviour in front of C, this is by shouting and swearing in an aggressive manner in front of C, even after being advised not to'.

 

The guardian summarises her contentions, and those of the Local Authority, in relation to him at E22 in these terms:  'Mr D M has striven to support Ms M to the best of his abilities. He has clearly found it hard to reduce his working hours with the consequent impact on family finances. Mr M is a provider for his family and the loss of work and income has impacted on him. He has expressed his frustration with his daughter's behaviour when she has not cooperated and tried to get Ms M to see the error of her ways. Their relationship has been noted to be conflicted and difficult at times. Alongside this, he has expressed his anger and hostility at the professionals involved in managing Ms M. Although at times he has been able to acknowledge the concerns of the Local Authority; this has not been consistent. This has not been in Ms M's interest; she is an immature, young adolescent who needs adult guidance and role modelling. As her father has struggled to appreciate the concerns and engage with the professionals, so she has likewise'.

 

DM himself says at C158: 'I have found the attitude of some of the professionals very condescending and it has made it quite difficult to work with them. I recognise that at times I have probably been hostile and I also recognise that I need to be prepared to work co-operatively with people. It has been tremendously challenging to have different people coming in and out of our property, observing us, commenting on what they see and on a lot of occasions been quite critical in a very unconstructive way rather than trying to encourage and support us'.

 

In my opinion a good insight into the difficulties within this family can be seen at C114b where the health visitor, HH says: 'On the 28th November 2013 at 9.10 a.m. I sent a text message to Miss MM to remind her of my visit that day at 10 a.m�..When I visited the family home at 10.10 a.m. neither Miss M nor C were at home. I spoke for a while to Mr DM, who expressed frustration at M's lack of engagement with professionals. He swore a lot about Ms M and said that she was going to lose C. Mr M said it would teach Ms M a lesson if she did lose C. Mr M was getting really fed up with Ms M attitude, and that they had argued a couple of days go because of this. Mr M said that he was fine with people, if they kept on the right side of him, but they would see a different side of him if they did not. He said 'that applies to everyone, even my own kids, and especially M'.

 

C � the health visitor says at C114e that there is evidence of  some developmental delay 'in the areas of manipulative skills, speech and language skills, hearing and cognitive skills'. When HH, the health visitor tested his development in January 2014 (at 8 months) these latter skills were at the six month level. However, that delay is only two months and it would certainly not be possible to exclude genetic factors (e.g. the mother's low IQ) being the cause of any delay. Further, C has been wearing glasses since the beginning of January 2014 and this may also assist with his development. The 'concerns' about development have not been substantiated before me.

 

C has been attending nursery on each Tuesday for five hours. CC Aoun, of the nursery, has filed a statement in which she says that Ms M has 'engaged with staff at X nursery, she gave good eye contact when listening to C's key worker when they were commenting on C's morning but Ms M did not say much in response'. There is little of evidential value to this case from the nursery.

 

Welfare considerations � I now turn to the legal considerations relating to welfare. I handed a copy these proposed legal directions at an early stage of this hearing and it was agreed by all legal representatives that were correct and sufficient.

 

Where, on applications for care orders such as this, the threshold criteria are fulfilled in relation to any given child (as is the case here), it is necessary to consider the provisions of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and section 1 of the Children Act 1989 when deciding whether to make the care order sought. Where there is an application for a placement order before the court the court must conduct a global, holistic approach to welfare issues weighing up the various available options before it. As part of that holistic approach the court must conduct the welfare analysis in relation to the placement application by considering the terms of section 52 (1)(b) and section 1 of the Adoption and Child Act 2002. The welfare checklist in the 1989 Act is not the same as the checklist in the 2002 Act. Article 8, of course, is also further and significantly engaged in relation to the placement application.

 

In Re G (A Child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, paras 49-50 MacFarlane LJ said: "In most child care cases a choice will fall to be made between two or more options. The judicial exercise should not be a linear process whereby each option, other than the most draconian, is looked at in isolation and then rejected because of internal deficits that may be identified, with the result that, at the end of the line, the only option left standing is the most draconian and that is therefore chosen without any particular consideration of whether there are internal deficits within that option�The linear approach � is not apt where the judicial task is to undertake a global, holistic evaluation of each of the options available for the child's future upbringing before deciding which of those options best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to the child's welfare."

 

The Court of Appeal has given guidance about the importance of applying the statutory factors in the 1989 and 2002 Acts. The guidance is to be found, for instance, in the case of EH v Greenwich [2010] EWCA Civ 344. I set out in full the relevant passage from the judgment of the late Baron J:

 





61. The judge was making a very draconian order. As such, he was required to balance each factor within the checklist in order to justify his conclusions and determine whether the final outcome was appropriate. Accordingly, because this analysis is entirely absent, his failure to mention the provisions of the Children Act and deal with each part of Section 1 (3) undermines his conclusions and his orders.







The Judge did not mention Article 8 of the ECHR. The terms of that Article provide that[ Baron J then set out Article 8 which I will set out below] 







67. In the case of Re P [2008] EWCA Civ 535 Wall LJ stated: -There is, perhaps, no more important or far-reaching decision for a child than to be adopted by strangers" �"Judges approaching the question of dispensation under the section must, it seems to us, ask themselves the question to which section 52 (1) (b) of the 2002 Act gives rise, and answer it by reference to section 1 of the same Act, and in particular by a careful consideration of all matters identified in section 1(4)�.. 







"�the best guidance which in our judgment this court can give is to advise Judges to apply the statutory language with care to the facts of the particular case. The message is no doubt, prosaic, but the best guidance, we think, is as simple and as straightforward as that."







68. The precise terms of the section which provides [the learned Judge then set out the provisions of section 1(4) of the Act, which I cite in full later];







69. The judge should have turned his mind to each of these provisions and not truncated his considerations as set out above. By so doing he specifically failed to address these children's particular needs and the likely effect on them (throughout their lives) of their ceasing to be a member of their original family. They have an established attachment to a loving mother who, with targeted assistance, might be able to provide some form of future mothering'.



Compliant with that case, I cite Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides. It states that: '1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society �for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.' 

 

Care orders amount to a very significant invasion of the rights encapsulated within Article 8(1). Placement orders amount to an even more significant invasion of that right than care orders. For such orders to be justified they must satisfy the provisions of Article 8(2) and therefore must be: a) in accordance with the law (here the Convention compliant Children Act 1989); b) necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms (i.e. welfare) of others (i.e. the child) and c) proportionate. There is no conflict between Article 8 and Section 1 of the 1989 Act � Dawson v Wearmouth [1999] 2 AC 308 and Payne v Payne [2001] 1 FCR 425.

 

The determination of whether the threshold criteria are fulfilled involves considering the position at the time that protective measures were taken (here, when the proceedings started). By contrast, welfare issues must be based on the totality of information available to the court and, unlike threshold issues, it is necessary to conduct a contemporary evaluation of what is best for the child concerned. 

 

Thus, in making welfare decisions I have to apply section 1 (1) of the Children Act 1989 in relation to the care application and section 1(2) of The Adoption and Children Act 2002 in relation to the placement application as well as section 52(1) (b). 

 

By section 1(1) of the 1989 Act the welfare of LJ is the court's paramount consideration. 

 

Section 1(3) of the Act contains the welfare checklist. It provides that, in making welfare decisions in a case such as this, a court must have regard in particular to �

 

(a)	the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of her age and understanding);



(b)	her physical, emotional and educational needs;



(c)	the likely effect on her of any change in her circumstances;



(d)	her age, sex, background and any characteristics of hers which the court considers relevant;



(e)	any harm which she has suffered or is at risk of suffering;



(f)	how capable each of her parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting her needs;



(g)	The range of powers available to the court under the Act.

The 2002 Act � Children may not be placed for adoption under placement orders without the consent of the parents unless "the welfare of the child requires the consent to be dispensed with" (section 52(1) (b) Adoption and Children Act 2002). The core statutory provisions in relation to placement orders are therefore sections 52 and 1 for the purposes of this judgment (although there are of course many other provisions in the Act relating to such orders).

 

The case of Re P (children) (adoption: parental consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2FCR 185 provides useful guidance in relation to applications for placement orders. The main and relevant principles for these purposes are set out in paragraphs 119 to 154 of the judgment of Wall LJ. Those principles are summarised in the case of EH v Greenwich [2010] EWCA Civ 344. I wish to mention the following three points that arise from Re P (although I have considered the case as a whole):

 



i)	In considering the provisions of section 52 I must consider section 1(4) of the 2002 Act (as explained in EH v Greenwich);



ii)	The word 'requires' in section 52 is 'plainly chosen as best conveying the essence of the Strasbourg jurisprudence'. That is, it implies an imperative rather than something that is merely optional or desirable;



iii)	Section 1(4) of the 2002 Act is not the same as section 1(3) of the 1989 Act. The welfare checklists are different in several important respects, especially s 1(4)(c) and (f). The court should therefore work through section 1(4) of the 2002 Act when considering whether to make a placement order.



Ryder LJ summarised the position in the case of Re R [2013] EWCA Civ 1018: 'So far as section 52 of the 2002 Act is concerned, the judge had to be satisfied that the welfare of each of the children required their parents' consent to be dispensed with. In other words, their welfare necessitates adoption and nothing else short of that will do. That formulation is derived from the terms of section 52 as explained by this court in Re P (Placement Orders: Parental Consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535, [2008] 2 FLR 625 CA at paragraphs 113 to 119 inclusive and, most recently as reiterated by the Supreme Court In the matter of B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33'.

 



The relevant parts of Section 1 of the 2002 Act provide as follows (I have not included ss 5):

 

(1)	This section applies whenever a court or adoption agency is coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child.



(2)	The paramount consideration of the court or adoption agency must be the child's welfare, throughout his life.



(3)	The court or adoption agency must at all times bear in mind that, in general, any delay in coming to the decision is likely to prejudice the child's welfare.



(4)	The court or adoption agency must have regard to the following matters (among others)�



(a)	the child's ascertainable wishes and feelings regarding the decision (considered in the light of the child's age and understanding),



(b)	the child's particular needs,



(c)	the likely effect on the child (throughout her life) of having ceased to be a member of the original family and become an adopted person,



(d)	the child's age, sex, background and any of the child's characteristics which the court or agency considers relevant,



(e)	any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of suffering,



(f)	the relationship which the child has with relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency considers the relationship to be relevant, including�



(i)	the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child of its doing so,



(ii)	the ability and willingness of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, to provide the child with a secure environment in which the child can develop, and otherwise to meet the child's needs,



(iii)	the wishes and feelings of any of the child's relatives, or of any such person, regarding the child.

(5)	�

(6)	The court or adoption agency must always consider the whole range of powers available to it in the child's case (whether under this Act or the Children Act 1989); and the court must not make any order under this Act unless it considers that making the order would be better for the child than not doing so.

(7)	In this section, "coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child", in relation to a court, includes�

(a)	coming to a decision in any proceedings where the orders that might be made by the court include an adoption order (or the revocation of such an order), a placement order (or the revocation of such an order) or an order under section 26 (or the revocation or variation of such an order),

(b)	coming to a decision about granting leave in respect of any action (other than the initiation of proceedings in any court) which may be taken by an adoption agency or individual under this Act,

but does not include coming to a decision about granting leave in any other circumstances.

(8) 	For the purposes of this section�

(a)	references to relationships are not confined to legal relationships,

(b)	references to a relative, in relation to a child, include the child's mother and father.

It is of fundamental importance that there is discipline in the approach to welfare issues in care and placement proceedings. The court is not a court of social engineering. The court does not decide welfare issues by considering whether, on an individual judge's analysis, a child might be considered to be 'better off' in care or adoption. Nor does the court apply a test of whether a child will receive 'optimal care' with a given parent since there would be many parents who would fail that test. Thus the court must not approach a case such as this by asking whether, on balance, a given child would be better off with adopters or with a parent. 

 

The dicta that I have already set out from Re B-S (and which have their basis in the judgments of Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Neuberger in Re B [2013] UKSC 33) must be applied. For myself I find the passages from the judgment of Lord Neuberger in paragraphs 77 and 78 of particular assistance. They include the following at paragraph 77:  'It seems to me to be inherent in section 1(1) that a care order should be a last resort, because the interests of a child would self-evidently require her relationship with her natural parents to be maintained unless no other course was possible in her interests. That is reinforced by the requirement in section 1 (3)(g) that the court must consider all options, which carries with it the clear implication that the most extreme option should only be adopted if others would not be in her interests'. 

 

Although care proceedings are quasi inquisitorial (see Re W [2013] EWCA Civ 1227), it is for the Local Authority to justify its applications and to substantiate its proposed care measures on evidence � P, C and S v United Kingdom [2002] 2 FLR 631. 

 

Fostering / adoption � No party suggests that long term fostering presents itself as an option for C. I agree that that is so. Black LJ said as follows in the case of Re V [2013] EWCA Civ 913:

 



[95] My difficulty with that is that I do not think that fostering and adoption can, in fact, be equated in terms of what they offer by way of security. I do not intend to embark on a comprehensive comparison of the two arrangements, merely to highlight some of the material differences. What I say should not be taken as a substitute for professional advice to the court from social services and/or the guardian in any case in which this is a significant issue. 





[96].�With that caveat, I make the following observations:



i)	Adoption makes the child a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he or she fully belongs. To the child, it is likely therefore to "feel" different from fostering. Adoptions do, of course, fail but the commitment of the adoptive family is of a different nature to that of a local authority foster carer whose circumstances may change, however devoted he or she is, and who is free to determine the caring arrangement. 



ii)	Whereas the parents may apply for the discharge of a care order with a view to getting the child back to live with them, once an adoption order is made, it is made for all time. 



iii)	Contact in the adoption context is also a different matter from contact in the context of a fostering arrangement. Where a child is in the care of a local authority, the starting point is that the authority is obliged to allow the child reasonable contact with his parents (section 34(1) Children Act 1989). The contact position can, of course, be regulated by alternative orders under section 34 but the situation still contrasts markedly with that of an adoptive child. There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the adoption order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.� 



iv)	Routine life is different for the adopted child in that once he or she is adopted, the local authority have no further role in his or her life (no local authority medicals, no local authority reviews, no need to consult the social worker over school trips abroad, for example).

Oral evidence � During the course of this hearing I have heard oral evidence from the following:

 

i)	Ms Gilder, the social worker - C128 and C189.

ii)	Dr Grace Tantam, the psychologist, whose report is at E27;

iii)	Mr S S, of the Countywide Contact Support Services;

iv)	Jennifer Coward, C2, C11, C27 and C59.

v)	Ms CS (who conducted the 'PAMS assessment � C68 with a list of dates of assessment sessions appearing at C33).

vi)	HH, the health visitor, whose statements are at C38a and at C114a.

vii)	M M, whose statements are at C23 and C152.

viii)	D M whose statement is at C157. 

ix)	The guardian, Ms Pravina Gulabivala whose report is at E16.

Ms Gilder - she said that she had seen the report of Dr Tantam and thought that it confirmed her own views. She has seen C once a week since she was allocated to the case in December. She said that D M has been hostile to her and has advised Ms M not to tell her anything and that Ms M is inconsistent about whether she wishes to speak to her. 

 

She said that, when she visits, there is always floor space for C but there is always a lot of clutter around the edges of the room. The impression she and other witnesses gave is that the house is sub optimal but was not such as to be any worse than might be encountered in many homes � cluttered and grubby rather than squalid. There are photographs that I was shown.

 

She said that she cannot think of any alternative to adoption as a means of meeting C's welfare and had considered every possibility when considering whether C can remain with his mother. She acknowledged the pressure that had existed for this mother during the currency of this case and that something like 23 professionals have been involved with the family. 

 

Ms Gilder said that she accepts that the family regards her as hostile to them and not supportive of their wish to retain the care of C. She agreed with Mr Farquarson that the family had the same impression of Ms Coward, the previous social worker. An example of the family's hostility to her is given at H166 when Ms Gilder visited on 10th January 2014 and wrote at H167: 'The family clearly do not want to work with the Local Authority'. She said that, on that occasion, D M kept coming into the room in which Ms Gilder was speaking to Ms M and repeatedly told Ms M that she did not need to speak to Ms Gilder. At H166 she describes D M as 'huffing and puffing'. 

 

She said that B's behaviour is unpredictable and intolerant and so the Local Authority was genuinely concerned about any involvement between him and C. She said that Ms M can try to protect C from B but, due to B's unpredictability (such as the incident at H125 when he became frustrated with his mobile), she could not say that Ms M can protect C from him. 

 

She said that, when she has seen C, he is always very well presented. Ms M interacts with C in the house and she accepted that there are many reports of two way interaction between mother and child in enclosure H. C appears to be a 'happy, content child' and 'smiles at everyone'. However, there are very basic deficiencies in the care that Ms M can offer to C and the help of her family cannot make up for them. 

 

She stressed the difficulty that she has encountered when trying to work with Ms M and her father.  She said that she is afraid of D M because of the way that he speaks. It is very difficult to speak to him because he is flippant and dismissive; for instance he rang the local council on one occasion when she was there and was speaking in a loud voice about his negative views of social workers.

 

I was impressed by the evidence of Ms Gilder. She has worked hard on this case and has ensured that there is a very high level of support for this family, notwithstanding the difficulties that they present. I accept that she has been met with hostility and rejection from the family when she has attempted to work with them and I also accept that she is genuinely afraid of Mr M (who is a tall and strongly spoken man).

 

Dr Grace Tantam � She learnt about the meeting between Ms M and Mr F just before giving evidence. She said that Ms M is a very vulnerable mother who has difficulty understanding risk and how to behave protectively. Due to the mother's cognitive limitations it is very difficult for her to identify risk and how to avoid it.  One of the themes in the report is Ms M difficulty in generalising, she said � thus Ms M does not learn from experience. She thought that Ms M would understand that professionals would get very upset about her meeting with C but she would have difficulty understanding why this was so and also carrying that lesson forward in her approach to other men. Dr Tantam stressed the level of the mother's vulnerability to pressure from others � thus, how could she meet up with Mr F given her allegation that he raped her?

 

She said that Ms M needs nurturing herself. Dr Tantam said that Ms M did not appear to have received nurturing from her family in a way that would allow her to develop; this is apparent from E32 -33 of Dr Tantam's report. Ms M described an up bringing in which 'everyone was shouting at each other'; the one time that Ms M 'lit up' in the meeting with Dr Tantam was when there was discussion about the time that Ms M spent living with her grandmother (who, later, sadly died). 

 

In her report Dr Tantam said at E33: 'M also told me about the level of shouting and conflict between her parents and how this had caused her to be very upset, and that her parents did not stop fighting even when others, such as her grandparents, intervened and said it was having an effect on M�[E37]�there are significant concerns with regard to M's capacity to provide safe care. She has very limited understanding of risk and the nature of harm that C might sustain and what she might need to do as his parent to act protectively�[E38]�M's exposure to extremely high levels of conflict in her childhood have led to her having difficulties in regulating her own emotions and it is likely that her threshold for her 'fight or flight' system being triggered is lower than most people'. 

 

Dr Tantam said that she had approached the case on the basis that, if the extended family was able to act protectively to make up the limitations in the abilities of Ms M, that might provide a solution but, she considered, that that protective element is not present. Ms M presents demands as a child herself (and so her own emotional needs conflict with those of C).

 

Dr Tantam also said that Ms M visibly withdrew when discussion moved on to her experience of emotional provision by her parents. Dr Tantam tried to gather an understanding of the mother's relationship with her parents but once the conversation moved away from very concrete matters Ms M disengaged (for instance, Ms M yawned when there was discussion about her father). Dr Tantam said that Ms M would have great difficulties when things were not 'OK' and she had to set aside her own difficulties to care for C. There is a significant and unsurprising body of evidence that poor emotional care of the mother would impact upon her abilities to provide emotional care for her child.

 

Whilst C is a baby it is relatively easy to provide for his emotional care. Dr Tantam foresaw increasing difficulties in Ms M's ability to care for C as he gets older.

 

Dr Tantam made the obvious point that a particularly strong feature of this case is just how much support has been provide by the Local Authority over the last ten months. She said that she did not think that any involvement could provide the type of 'wrap around protection' that would be needed to keep C safe. Ms M's ability to work with professionals is limited by her cognitive limitations. She said that Ms M is herself very much in need of support. She said that she hoped the process of maturation would allow Ms M to ameliorate some of her vulnerabilities but that is a medium to long term process and would require individual work with Ms M due to the complexities of her limitations.

 

The evidence that Dr Tantam gave was very well presented and thoroughly convincing. She had investigated this case well.

 

SS � He is employed by Gloucestershire as part of the Countywide Contact Support Services. Between November 2013 and March 2014 he visited the family about 34 times. He is not a social worker but is experienced in his job and, he said, is also a foster carer. 

 

He said that Ms M and D M have always been welcoming to him. D has sometimes said that he is 'pissed off' when there have been difficulties with the social workers, however SS has never experienced any displays of anger from Ms M. He said that the condition of the home has improved over time and there is always a pathway for C to crawl along. It is now consistently in that improved condition.

 

He has never seen D M raising his voice and frightening C. He has never seen Ms M raising her voice either. C is a smiling and happy child. M stimulates and plays with C. D is very good with C and has a strong bond with C. The family is strongly committed to C.

 

B used to be in the house and was always polite to SS.  More recently, SS has seen B outside the house. SS has not had any difficulty with B and he has not seen any animosity amongst the family members.

 

Jennifer Coward � She said that she saw D M's house being inappropriate with clutter and dogs (the dogs were later removed). She saw B being quite intimidating and arguing with GGM H whilst walking around the room with C on the floor. 

 

At H125 there is a record of an incident that Ms Coward witnessed where B became agitated, swore and threw his mobile phone; Ms Coward said that she left soon afterwards. She said that she was genuinely concerned about B being around in the house. She said that D M was verbally aggressive to her and to the family support worker. D M was not happy with her going to the home at all and did not like that she gave him advice about what he should be doing and also that she wrote reports about the family. 

 

Ms Coward said that her experience is that Ms M would speak aggressively to her � saying loudly that she hated social workers and never wanted them to come back. Further, there were a number of occasions when she visited and D was shouting and swearing in front of C; she said that in the majority of times that she visited in the last ten weeks that was working on this case she was shouted at by Mr M � he would raise his voice and swear. For example on an occasion in January when Ms Coward said the Local Authority would apply to the court for C's removal, he called her a cunt in front of C. 

 

D M himself says at C158: 'I have found the attitude of the professionals very condescending and it has made it quite difficult to work with them. I recognise that at times I have probably been hostile and I also recognise that I need to be prepared to work co-operatively with people. It has been tremendously challenging to have different people coming and 

 

She said that she was visiting once or twice a week and most of the time C was stuck in his car seat. There were times when she saw interaction between the mother and C but this decreased in time. She accepted that there was interaction but said that it was not consistent. 

 

She said that Ms M would switch off when advice was given. She would begin by getting upset and angry, say that she was being criticised and then not engage in the conversation. I note that Dr Tantam gave similar evidence.

 

Ms CS - she said that Ms M was sometimes co operative with the work of assessment, sometimes not (e.g. she refused to participate in as session on 8th November, there were two days when Ms M was not present when Ms CS attended and there was a day when the guardian was present and the mother was distressed and not able to participate in assessment work). She said that a mother who has needs such as this is of concern because she required training in one-third of the domains that were identified. 

 

She said that the first time that she went to the house D M was pointing fingers at her (and her service manager) and made it plain that he did not want her there. On other occasions D M was around and on two of those occasions he was grumbling and quite agitated (saying that he was going to ring a solicitor 'or somebody').

 

She said that a parent who had the ratings recorded in the PAMs report would need a high degree of support to understand the developmental needs of the child.  She thinks that the mother needs a lot of teaching at a level that would require frequent intervention. Without that the child would suffer. She thought that the mother will sometimes take things on board but would not manage C on her own. 

 

HH - She said that she is still the health visitor for C. She visits once a fortnight and KK visits on the intervening week � thus there is a visit each week either by herself or by KK. She said that the house is variable as to its condition; the photographs that have been produced show the house at its best, she said. The house was not very clean but one would not call it squalid � she agreed that 'grubby and cluttered' would describe it.

 

At times the family has expressed resentment and frustration about her being in the house � this happens on about 30 to 50% of the times that she visits and tends to arise quite quickly. D M has a particularly short fuse; there has been a variety of things that have frustrated him when she visits such as money and the involvement of social workers. The level of support is at a much, much higher level than most young mothers would be getting.

 

She said that she had been dealing with Ms M since June 2013 and has not noticed very much progress at all in Ms M's understanding about how to care for C. Sometimes it seems as though things have improved but then, on a later occasion, it becomes apparent that things have taken a step backwards. HH said that she felt that Ms M has been given lots of support in a positive way and that there is nothing else that could have been done.

 

She said that she has continued to have concerns about Ms M's care of C. She gave examples of Ms M leaving C unattended on a sofa, giving him dairy foods despite his lactose intolerance and, on another recent occasion when HH asked to see C bottom due to his persistent nappy rash, Ms M 'yanked' C out of the baby walker roughly and then removed his nappy roughly, she said.

 

She said that she supports the Local Authority's actions and application. She does not think that Ms M has the ability to meet C's needs as they develop and become more complex. Ms M can meet his basic needs most of the time but, as he grows older, will be unable to do so. When she first became involved she was more optimistic about Ms M's ability to care for C than she is now. Now, she said, she is more concerned than she was then.

 

Ms M � She was very distressed when giving evidence (as she did, bravely, by video link). She explained that she does not still give C dairy food. She follows a written food chart. She said that she gave him toast for breakfast that morning. When I asked what she put on the toast she said 'butter' but said that it was not dairy butter (although she could not say what sort of butter it was). She said that she is confident about handling C and did not accept the account of Ms Force that she had handled C roughly. She found it really hard working with Ms Coward and Ms Gilder; they talked down to her as if she was a bad person.

 

She spoke of the day that she spent with F F recently. She said that she had not wanted to go but F persuaded her do so. His mum sent her a text message saying that, if Ms M did not go, it would mean that she was stopping F from seeing his son. F had been speaking to Ms M by Facebook; she tried to block him, but he found her new Facebook address. She did not know why she had not blocked him again. Before she left Town that day she was in the house with C and just her Dad and possibly her Nan. She told them that she was just going out for the day; her Dad did not ask her where � she and her dad were not on speaking terms that day. 

 

She said that she caught a bus to Gloucester and met C at Gloucester station. She was scared and, she said, 'so was C'. She had not wanted F to come to her own house because there would have been a fight. She thought that F would have done so if she had not agreed to meet with him. When she went to his parents' house she felt worried and scared because she did not want to be there. She got back home in the evening having left at about 9 o'clock in the morning. She said that she knew that it was on the written agreement that she should not go and that she had not wanted to. She did not tell her dad about having gone to see F until she came to court at the start of this hearing.

 

She said that she knows that she is not supposed to go out with C at all on her own. Her father had told her off the day that she went out to see F with C (the evidence of D M was somewhat different).

 

D M � He said that reducing his hours of work has been a huge issue because of the financial impact. It has meant that he could not pay his rent and it has created some difficulties within the home. He could not afford to continue with the current arrangement and might have to give up work altogether to claim benefits. He would do whatever he could to support M. He has done a lot of work on the house to get it into the current better shape; he and M now have to rota to do the housework. He said that he does not intend to stay at this property if he can help it and has started to look to rent privately.

 

He said that he and M get on pretty well now and have bonded. They had not really bonded before she and C came to live at the house in September. He thought that it was a realistic prospect that M might live on her own with C. He would be on the end of a phone to help if needed. He said that, if C is with M, he thinks that M will look for a place on her own when the council can offer her somewhere. 

 

He said that the social workers have talked down to M and he finds that difficult. In his opinion, the Local Authority has not helped at all and he does not believe in asking for help anyway; if he cannot do it himself he leaves it. He later acknowledged that KK, RR and CJ had helped M. 

 

He did not accept that he has lost his temper with the social workers since, if he does lose his temper, he goes 'off the wall'. If social workers spoke nicely to M he would get on with them. He denied swearing at the social workers or using the word 'cunt' to describe any of them; he did not accept that he called the social worker a 'fucking cunt' as recorded at H109C. I did not believe his evidence on this issue; I am sure that he did use that language.

 

He said that B has not been in the house since the second agreement was put in place. Surprisingly, he said that M cannot [sic] stand up to B, although she is very protective of C. B is tall and of big build.

 

He said that F F came as a lodger for four months at the insistence of GM M and he did not want F in the house.  He knew nothing about F F before he came. He thought that M was going out to see her mum on the day that M and F met up recently. He rang GM M that afternoon and learnt that M had not gone to her mother's. However, when she returned home, he did not ask M where she had been and just asked her whether she had had a good day. Asked how he could prevent her behaving like that again, he said that he did not know. He and M have not spoken about this. 

 

He said that he has a very poor opinion of F; F pinned M up against the wall on two occasions when living with them. If F came to the house he would hit him. It was not safe for C to be with M and C since F can be nice one minute and then mistreat M the next. There is no knowing how he would treat her.

 

He thinks that M is a very good mother; she is a much better parent that he ever was, he said.

 

Ms Gulabivala � She said that she adheres to her recommendations and conclusions. She agreed with the report and evidence of Dr Tantam. She did not think that Ms M can meet C needs within his timescales. 

 

When she was first appointed she was concerned that there should be a parenting assessment and thought that a PAMs assessment was the most suitable form for it. The PAMs assessment was delayed as Ms M made it very plain in a meeting on 8th November that the assessment was not necessary and was 'babyish' [E20]; thus it was decided that Ms M needed more time to do the session. When she saw that report she thought that the Local Authority had put in an extensive package of support and monitoring.

 

She did not think that C's needs would be met by him remaining with Ms M even with a package of support. She did not think that the support package would be successful. She did not think that it would be accepted and did not think that the family sees the need for it.

 

She said that she has discussed with Ms Gilder whether prospective adopters are available and said that she had been told that a possible family had already been identified.

 

Mr Farquarson's submissions � Mr Farquarson submitted that this is not a case where it can be said that nothing other than adoption will do. Ms M has shown strong commitment and love for C. She has met his physical care needs by keeping him warm, fed, clothed and clean. His health needs have been met to a reasonable standard and she has taken him to the doctor. There have been over 200 visits by Countywide and there has been no suggestion of any emergency or risk of immediate harm arising that might have led to C's removal. There is no suggestion of any physical mistreatment of C. Physically he is a healthy child; there is no suggestion that he is under-weight or over-weight.

 

The fact that he is a happy child suggests that he is receiving appropriate emotional care from a mother who is attuned to his emotional needs. A removal of C from his mother and natural family would be a huge change in his circumstances. The family history of learning disability, which would have to be made known to any prospective adopters, may make it more difficult to find adopters for him. C has been in three different placements in his life so far and has seen tension within the home in which he lives. Home hygiene is certainly not at a level that would justify intervention but it is noteworthy that Ms CS said that this was her principle concern.

 

The suggestions that B has been in the house after the second agreement are not substantiated by evidence. Ms M has co operated with some professionals such as RR, KK and CJ and is capable of working with some of them. There are 24 professionals who have worked with Ms M and, in the main and besides HH, Ms Coward and Ms Gilder, there has been a reasonable relationship with them. The tensions within the home are understandable given the 'goldfish bowl' effect of being observed by so many professionals and also the financial pressures that they have been under.

 

As to Dr Tantam's evidence that Ms M does not have the cognitive and emotional ability to care for C in the long term, the past ten months suggest otherwise.

 

Ms Knapp's submissions - She advanced submissions that were supportive of those advanced by Mr Farquarson. Due the mother's young age and own need for parenting the state should provide services that would allow the mother to maintain her role as C's parent and develop her parenting as she matures.

 

Mr Norris's submissions � The Local Authority has worked very hard to try to help this mother to be given the opportunity to be brought up by his family. However, despite the exceptionally high level of support and services Ms M is not able to care for C adequately. She does not get support from her mother and herself says that she has a poor relationship with her father (as Dr Tantam reported). She has a complex relationship with her volatile brother and has been unable to resist Mr F despite her stated fear of him. There is no one within the family to protect C or her. There is no alternative to adoption.

 

If C remains with Ms M she and her father suggest that she will move to live on her own with C. No package of support can be put in place that would meet C's welfare demands.

 

Ms MacMillan Scott's submissions � The mother has struggled, is brave and loves her little boy. It is agreed that there are only two options � C remains with C or C is placed for adoption. Initially the guardian had some optimism. However, that optimism has not been maintained. The PAMs assessment raises very basic gaps in the mother's parenting ability. The people with whom the family have had difficulties are the important ones � the health visitor and the social workers. For the health visitor to be afraid to go into the house is very unusual.

 

The evidence of Dr Tantam is correct. As Dr Tantam said, if the parents of Ms M were a 'safe pair of hands' the case would be different; however they are not.

 

Analysis of welfare checklist � Since there are only two options that are available for consideration I analyse them together by reference to the welfare checklists in the 1989 and 2002 Act.

 

C is plainly too young for his current wishes and feelings to be ascertained. He has the needs of a ten month child. Ms M could not meet them on her own. Even his basic needs of feeding, hygiene, warmth, stimulation, washing and safety (the points identified in the PAMs report) are beyond her without an exceptionally high level of supervision and help. Even with the exceptional level of supervision there are still significant lapses in her care of him (such as when she went with C to visit F F). 

 

If, contrary to her evidence, she were to remain within her family home and if she and her family members were to be offered and were to accept a continuing exceptional level of support from a wide range of professionals C's basic needs would be met most of the time as they have been. However:

 

i)	It is highly unlikely that she would accept that level of long-term support ;

ii)	It is highly unlikely that her family would accept it either;

iii)	The tensions within her own family make it unrealistic to think that the current arrangement of family support would continue in the long-term either;

iv)	Even if the family and professional support could remain at the present level, for C to live in an environment where that level of support is necessary for even his basic needs to be met would be extremely limiting.

v)	Both Ms M and D M spoke of Ms M's intention to find accommodation elsewhere.

vi)	There would still be significant lapses due to the underlying cognitive limitations of Ms M and her inability to retain things that she has been taught.

Anything beyond C's basic needs would not be met in her care even if C and Ms M did continue to have that exceptional level of support. It is inconceivable that Ms M could arrange for his education, social development, emotional development, nutrition or daily organisation either or on her own or with help from others. It is simply a matter of her not being equipped to provide what C needs. One only has to try to picture a toddler in the household at 'A' Rd that has been so clearly described to see how impossible an arrangement that would be. If one then tries to imagine Ms M living on her own with C, it is even more apparent that such an arrangement would be unachievable in a way that is consistent with C's welfare. In response to Ms Knapp's skilful submission, no end of services provided by the state could make up for those deficiencies.

 

Thus, in relation to C's needs, they will not be met if he remains with his mother. If he moves to an adoptive placement there is every reason to suppose that they will be met. I recognise the power of Mr Farquarson's submission that his family background (including Ms M's intellectual limitations) may render it more difficult to find adopters but I heard no evidence to suggest that this would be insurmountable (and my own experience as a judge who deals frequently with adoption work would be contrary to Mr Farquarson's well presented argument).

 

The effect of C changing his circumstances so that he moves from his mother's care to an adoptive placement in which he ceases to be a member of his natural family for the rest of his life is plainly of the utmost significance to him. He is now ten months old and has spent the whole of his life so far being cared for by her. By now he has developed obvious attachments to those that surround him and care for him, especially his mother. Further, he is a much loved baby who attracts the natural affection of his natural family. Therefore separation from his mother will cause him the distress and anxiety that any child of his age would suffer by being separated from his primary carer, known environment and extended family. Those are all very significant features of his circumstances that have to be taken firmly into account, as I do. It is another extremely painful aspect of this desperately sad case. 

 

Further, in the long term he will know that he had a natural loving family that wanted to care for him and which he has lost through adoption. That sense of loss may leave him with emotional difficulties in the medium and long term in a way that also must be considered now, as I do also. There is a magnetic connection that exists between any individual and his natural background that may exert its influence over C's emotional welfare at any stage throughout his life (e.g. I often receive requests for adoption files to be inspected by people who were adopted many years ago because they want to trace their background in order to help them understand their own identities and what has happened to them). Adoption is not a panacea.

 

Against that, however, must be the recognition that a change of circumstances that leads to C becoming an adopted person will at least offer him the chance of an upbringing in which he has his needs met and in which he is parented adequately. Unfortunately, because of Ms M's own age, circumstances and intellectual limitations she cannot offer him that. I agree that she is still at a level where she has the needs of a child herself in a way that ill equips her for parenthood. In adoption C would have the benefit of an upbringing by an adopter or by adopters who had been carefully selected and who had chosen to parent him. He would also be looked after by people who were able to do so adequately, which will not be the case if he remains with his mother. Further C would be protected from the conflicted environment in which he is currently living and would have the chance of an adequate childhood all of which would be denied to him if he remained with his natural family.

 

At ten months C is now of an age where he must have his future finally decided. There cannot be any further period of assessment; in any event, there is now such a wealth of evidence that further assessment would serve no purpose. His background is that he was born to a fifteen year old mother with exceptionally low cognitive abilities and a conflicted family. For ten months every effort has been made to try to keep him within that family but those efforts have not succeeded. The same problems kept emerging and are not going to alter since they have their origins in the mother's own difficulties and limitations as well the dysfunction within her family. 

 

As to that family dysfunction I give these examples (and there are many more that could be given): i) the fact that Mr F, who the father says was unknown to him and was violent, came to lodge at the house at all and then remained for four months; ii) the complications that B has posed; iii) the family response to social workers; iv) the apparent lack of involvement from Ms M's mother when Ms M gave birth as a teenager and her absence from court; v) the response of D M when he learnt that Ms M had gone out for the day and was not with her mother as he thought (i.e. he did not ask her where she had been despite the terms of the agreement at C104).

 

The harm of leaving C within this environment is that his emotional, physical, social and educational needs would not be met. I think that it is highly likely that if he were to be left in his mother's care now it would be a matter of only a few months before that arrangement broke down entirely, leading to C having to be found an alternative home at an even later stage. It is inconceivable in my opinion that Ms M would be able to manage his care, with or without her family's help, for more than that short further period. She has been unable to adhere to agreements made with the Local Authority and would be likely to expose C to the risks of emotional harm from the conflict within her family and also from her conflict with F F. If she does remain at 'A' Road it would be na�ve to think that B (who lives two doors away with other family members) would not visit in the future.

 

C has developed a relationship of attachment with his mother and his natural family. His family want to care for him and love him. However, if they do so it will lead to the consequences that I have outlined above.

 

Conclusion - Under the Children Act 1989 the range of available orders is limited to making no order, making a supervision order or making a care order. The most interventionist order is the care order. However, on the facts of this case and the evidence that I have heard a care order is the only order that can be made consistently with the welfare of C. Nothing short of such an order of last resort will do. Thus a care order is necessary and proportionate and I am driven to make one.

 

That decision means that, of the two identified possible options, the option of C remaining with his mother is not available. In the light of the matters that I have set out above and consistent with all of the professional evidence, I find that the only available order that will meet the paramount welfare of C is a placement order. Thus I conclude that the welfare of C requires that I must dispense with the consent of M M (and, insofar as may be necessary, his father F F) to C being placed for adoption. I make a placement order and approve the care plan of the Local Authority.

 

Conclusion - I therefore make a care order in relation to C M. Having dispensed with the requisite consents in the terms set out above, I make a placement order.

 

Finally - I would wish to recognise the excellence of the legal representation that has been provided to Ms M by her counsel and her solicitors. This is a heart breaking case for all concerned but most particularly for this young mother. I have no doubt at all that that highly distressing impact will be felt by those have supported Ms M, including her legal team and I can only express my own regret that this judgment, for which I am solely responsible, should be the instrument of so much pain.

JUDGE SWINDELLS:



	This is a very sad case involving the welfare of M, who was born on [a date in] 2013.  His mother is JD, who is herself a young woman, having been born on [a date in] 1994.  His father is CB, who was born on [a date in]  1991.  The father has not played a part in these proceedings.  I say it is a sad case because JD, as a young girl, came before this court and was herself the subject of a care order. So this court has a detailed knowledge of the difficulties that JD has faced already in her very young life. What is truly positive in this case is that it is clear from the wealth of material that, notwithstanding her hugely difficult background, she herself has made progress in her individual life.

 

  

    I, therefore, want to set out at the forefront of this judgment that this is a young mother who has shown her love and commitment for M. She was a committed participant in a mother and baby foster placement where she showed gentle loving care for M.  Notwithstanding all her difficult care history, she was committed and cooperated with the local authority during the mother and baby placement and I am fully satisfied that she did all that she possibly could within her personal resources to place herself in a position to be able to care for M. 

 

 

 	The sadness is that the court has before it a report by the Consultant Forensic Psychologist, Dr David Briggs, which is a pessimistic report as to the mother's abilities to be able to care safely for M.  There was a detailed assessment by the Independent Social Worker, Nick Wale, which also reached a negative conclusion but in the course of the assessment, a number of positives were highlighted in aspects of this young mother's care of M.

 

 

    So it is against this somewhat daunting background that the court has to consider and

 

         carry out the welfare evaluation and the placement option evaluation in this case.



     As the local authority's plan is for a care order and a placement order it is necessary for

 

         the court to consider the first principles which a court must always have in mind at every stage of the process.  The starting point is Article 8 of the European Convention, the right to respect for private and family life; the key principle of which is that 'the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that, and effort should be devoted towards that end.  Cutting off contact and the relationship between a child and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child'.  The Supreme Court in the matter of Re B (A Child, Care Proceedings) [2013] UKSC 33 emphasised that orders contemplating non-consensual adoption are a very extreme thing, a last resort, only to be made where nothing else will do and to be made only in exceptional circumstances and where motivated by the overriding requirements pertaining to the child's welfare.  



	My paramount consideration has to be the welfare of M.  In determining where his best interests lie I have to have regard to the welfare checklist in Section 1(3) Children Act 1989 and, in particular in this case, Section 1(4) Adoption and Children Act 2002.  This is a case where there are positives in terms of the mother's parenting and there is evidence that she has built a strong attachment with M.  The court always has to weigh very carefully in the balance the incalculable benefit to a child in being cared for by a member of the family and, in this case, particularly his mother.  She urges upon me to give her an opportunity to care for M in the future in the home of her aunt, who lives   away from the difficulties which her extended family have presented her with over the years including in her efforts to care for M.  There are positives in the mother's favour but the court cannot ignore the assessment by Dr Briggs, which I have to say was stark reading, and also the assessments of Mr Wale.  The court has also weighed very carefully in the balance the final evidence of the allocated social worker and the thorough analysis by the Children's Guardian, who supports the making of care and placement orders.  

 



	M is not of an age or understanding where his wishes or feelings could be a determinative factor but I am sure that if he had a voice he would say that he would wish to stay with his mother and the court takes that into account.  But M's particular needs require  a permanent and settled home which provides him with a safe and secure environment which meets all of his needs and which will provide a solid foundation for him to be able to meet his full potential.  This is a welfare need that is 'here and now' and cannot wait.  There will of course be lifelong losses resulting from him ceasing to be a member of his original family and becoming an adoptive child if ultimately an adoption order is made, and those include the impact upon his sense of identity and esteem. On the other hand a plan of permanency by way of adoption brings the advantage of a lifelong committed and enduring relationship with prospective adoptive family members.  The court has to take account of the potential for harm were M return to either parent's care, and the risk would be that he would suffer significant harm in terms of neglect.  This is something that the court cannot ignore but must be weighed very, very carefully in the balance.

 



	Looking at the wishes of the mother, I fully understand, given her commitment to M, her heartfelt wish to be able to care for him in the future because there is no doubt that she loves him very dearly. Given the risks, however, the court has to say that the value of the relationship which his parents can bring to him is something that can be sustained through the proposed contact and the important lifestory work. The mother, prioritising M's interests, has dedicated herself to providing the relevant material for his life story book.

 



	Sadly the court has to conclude that there are deficiencies in the mother's parenting ability and it is not really possible that changes can be effected in her ability within the welfare timescales of this little baby. I have, therefore, with regret to conclude that the welfare balance strikes down in favour of making the care order and the placement order.

 



	Turning to the placement option evaluation, neither a residence order to the mother, even if supported by a supervision order, or a placement with her under the auspices of a care order with the local authority sharing parental responsibility, would, in my judgment, provide M with a safe placement which provides those benefits I have identified that he requires in his environment for him to grow and develop as an individual.  The court has, however, carefully to consider the differences between long-term fostering and adoption.  Fostering is a less interventionist option in that it falls short of severing the legal ties with the birth family and is more likely to provide a vehicle for maintaining contact with the natural family.  A placement order, however, would ultimately make M a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he would belong throughout his life.  Adoption would be likely to feel very different to M from fostering; the commitment of the adoptive family being of a different nature to that of local authority foster carers. Also it would free M from the statutory intrusion which a care order entails.  

 



	Accordingly, with a sense of deep sadness, carrying out the holistic evaluation of the benefits and detriments of each of the options I can only conclude that a care order and a placement order would be in M's interests in providing him with that sense of permanency, which I am satisfied is his overriding welfare need and, therefore, justifies intervention in the family.

 



	I have to go on to consider the issue of dispensing with consent.  Section 52(1)(b) of the 2002 Act provides that the consent of the parent with capacity can only be dispensed with if the welfare of the child requires this, and 'require' has that strong Strasbourg meaning of 'necessity'.  This is a stringent test but for all the sad reasons that I have already outlined I am satisfied that that test is met in this case and that the welfare of M does require dispensation of his parents' consent. 

 



   I cannot but feel personally a sense of tragedy having been involved with JD for so          many years.  She has made brave decisions today but she could not, for understandable reasons, bring herself to consent to either of the orders. As a result of the hearing today there are some improved prospects in terms of the direct contact that she will have �sadly for only a limited period � with M. It is hoped that the sessions of contact that she has, which are so precious to this young mother, can be extended to four hours, and I endorse those carefully thought out proposals for contact.  I very much hope that this can be achieved for this young mother.  

 



	I make the care order and the placement order. Additionally, I will make an order for the transcript of the judgment at public expense.

See:  Baby H (the outcome hearing) [2014] EWFC B156 (31 July 2014)

 

JUDGE ROBERTS:

 

1�������� (At this point the recording machine was
switched on):� � Ipswich County Court on the 8th November 2014 in
the case of baby H, a little girl born on the 6th July 2013.� Hallet
DJ made a care order and a placement order for baby H and her Mother, appeals
against both of these orders.� I have read Hallet DJ�s judgment and much of the
transcript of the oral evidence which he heard.� I have read the transcript of
the hearing and the judgment before Holt HHJ where permission was given for
this appeal.� I have read skeleton arguments by Miss Fottrell, who represents
the Mother, by Mr. Jenkins for Suffolk County Council, and from Ms. Miller for
the Guardian, and I have heard submissions from each of these advocates.� I
gave permission for the Mother to file and serve a further statement which was
mainly important for the exhibits, and I have read that statement with
exhibits.� The Mother had asked for permission to appeal in person and was
granted that permission by Holt HHJ on the 19th December last year.�
Today the local authority opposes the appeal.� The Guardian opposed the appeal
until she had heard Miss Fottrell�s submissions, at which point she withdrew
her opposition.� Baby H�s Father plays no part in the appeal - he is in prison
- but I note that he was supportive of the Mother�s case at the final hearing.

 

2�������� The context of the appeal is that baby H was
made the subject of an interim care order within a few days of her birth, and
she has therefore been in foster care for virtually her whole life.� The local
authority had become involved, as I understand it, because baby H�s Father
was being investigated for a serious sexual offence, and indeed he pleaded
guilty to that charge shortly before baby H was born.� The local authority
considered that the Mother�s reaction to these matters was inadequate and
during their pre-birth assessment Suffolk arranged for the Mother to be
assessed by a psychologist, Bisbey, and that assessment and their own at led to
the issue of proceedings and a threshold document which referred to the Mother
as being vulnerable to being controlled within relationships and her having
mental health issues, including one or more suicide attempts.� The local
authority�s case was that baby H would be at risk of emotional harm from her
Mother if the Mother was under stress in the future, either from relationships
or otherwise.� The local authority criticise the Mother for failing to engage
with any mental health services in the past and submitted that her family did
not consider that she currently had any issues.

 

3�������� I note that the local authority�s final
evidence, other than a cursory addendum to deal with the factors raised in the
case of Re BS, was dated the 31st August last year.� I have
to say that although we are all working towards a 26-week timetable it seems to
me that this case has been dealt with unreasonably fast by the local authority,
therefore not allowing the Mother proper time to adjust to her new
circumstances of being a mother and to react to the local authority�s evidence
and to reflect on what steps she might need to take or sufficient time to show
what steps she was taking to allay the local authority�s concerns.� The final
hearing was at the four month point.� I have to be a critical of a process
which meant that this case was dealt with at such speed.

 

4�������� The law I have to apply when dealing with an
appeal is that I must allow the appeal if I find that the decision of the
District Judge was either wrong or unjust because of a serious procedural or
other irregularity, and in this case it is submitted that the decision was
wrong.� Miss Fottrell has rightly referred me to various recent cases emanating
from the Court of Appeal, starting with Re BS and culminating in Re
BS, and indeed the later decision in the matter of W.� I have
reminded myself of the most relevant paragraphs in all these cases and I note
that of course there is no disagreement at the bar as to what the law is.

 

5�������� I shall allow the appeal as I consider that
the decision of Hallet DJ was wrong.� There has been very little time for me to
prepare this judgment because I have been reading up to the last possible
minute, but I shall set out the key points where I have found the District
Judge to be wrong, and if I fail to deal with some of the matters in Miss
Fottrell�s skeleton argument it does not mean that I do not find them also to
be good points.� I should preface my remarks by saying that I will know that it
is easier to pick holes in a judgment than to prepare it at the end of a hard
fought case, but in this case, in summary, I do not think that the Judge had
sufficient material to find that the only option for baby H was adoption away
from her family.

 

6�������� This is a case in which the local authority
submitted, and the District Judge found, that the child was likely to suffer
emotional harm in the future.� The District Judge discounted the risk of
physical harm on the evidence but found that there was a risk of emotional
harm.� It has been very difficult for me to identify what that risk exactly
was;� it certainly is not clear from the judgment.� Although there was material
before the District Judge to find that the Mother had difficulties I could find
little analysis of how these difficulties would affect baby H if the Mother had
care of baby H, and no analysis of how such difficulties could be managed if
baby H was at home with her Mother.� The key issue is whether the Mother was
doing enough to deal with her difficulties and whether the court should either
return baby H to her care or keep baby H in foster care until there could be a
further assessment of how the Mother was doing.� 

 

7�������� Unlike most cases where therapy is advised,
in this case Bisbey advised it pre-birth, in this case the Mother was fortunate
enough to have begun therapy in July 2013.� This is because her father was in a
position to pay for it and because the Mother and her father considered it was
something she should do.� This fact led Bisbey to change her prognosis about
whether the Mother could parent from poor to moderate at the final hearing.�
Bisbey said that by March, by which time the Mother would have been in therapy
for some nine months, an assessment could be done to see if the Mother would be
in a position to have baby H in her care whilst completing her therapy.� The
circumstances were therefore quite unusual.� I cannot think of a case I have
done where at final hearing a Mother has already completed four months of
intense therapy where that requirement is the main issue remaining in the
case.� In my judgment that fact and the evidence from the Mother, her father and
Bisbey, who had spoken to the therapist, was enough for the District Judge to
have to conclude that the risk to baby H of being placed back with her Mother
was not made out, or at least not sufficiently made out, to justify the
draconian step of a care order and a placement order.� 

 

8�������� That of course leads me on to the other main
deficiencies of the judgment.� There is no proper analysis of the disadvantages
to baby H of being removed permanently from her Mother, and certainly no
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of the various options
available to the court.� The local authority had not properly analysed this
either to assist the court, and although in August they may have been unaware
of what BS was saying, as Miss Fottrell has pointed out, Re B had
already appeared and contained much of the same guidance.� The addendum
statement which Mr. Jenkins has referred me to failed to do a proper analysis
of what either would be gained or lost by the various options.� The other main
deficiency is that there is no consideration of the proportionality of the
decision to remove baby H permanently from her family.� The word
�proportionate� appears at the very end of the judgment but not in the context
of any consideration of the evidence or the options.� 

 

9�������� But this is a clear case where it was
necessary for the Judge to stand back and consider all the evidence in what
McFarlane LJ had described as a global holistic valuation.� If he had done so I
do not think he would have concluded that it was proportionate to sever baby
H�s connection with her birth family.

 

10������ As I have said, there is a great deal of
pressure on courts to complete care cases in a timely manner.� However, the
system does allow for the case which does not fit in the timescale.� In this
case when the issue was risk of future emotional harm and there was evidence of
the Mother not only doing all that anyone could expect of her to improve
herself but of doing so with success it was necessary for the court to conclude
that delaying the final decision was in baby H�s interests, especially bearing
in mind that for a baby born in July it was thought that a proper assessment
could be done in March.

 

11������ So I shall set aside the care order and the
placement order and I shall make an interim care order.� It seems to me right
that Bisbey is asked to assess how the Mother is doing in her therapy on the
same basis as before, which will involve Bisbey speaking to the therapist and
to advise on whether baby H can be returned to the Mother�s care at this point
or, if not, at which point, if at all.� That work must be carried out within, I
would hope, the next three weeks, so I will hear any submissions on that.� I
would then propose that a hearing takes place before Newton HHJ at Ipswich
County Court before the expiry of the interim care order, if at all possible,
to consider either a rehabilitation plan or otherwise how the case should
proceed.

 

12������ In the meantime clearly contact must be
reintroduced.� I cannot see why the Mother should have the support of one of
her parents during the contact, but I will leave that to be considered with the
input of the Guardian.� Clearly any contact must be set at a level to prepare
for rehabilitation but not at too high a level in case that does not happen.

 

13������ As for costs, I shall order the local
authority to pay a contribution towards the Mother�s costs.� It is the case
that the Mother�s original grounds did not make too much sense.� However, once
the local authority had heard the views of Holt HHJ they should have given very
serious consideration to conceding the appeal.� It is the case that they would
only have received the skeleton argument of Miss Fottrell last week and
perhaps, being generous, only then realised the weight of the Mother�s case.� I
have also pointed out the failure to address BS guidelines sufficiently
in the addendum.� In such circumstances, it seems to me that the local
authority should pay 50 percent of the Mother�s costs of the appeal.

JUDGMENTAPPROVED








 

HIS HONOUR JUDGE
TYZACK QC:

1.    
This
court has been dealing with a case involving a boy, A, who is 14, and a girl,
B, who is 11, The court has been asked to decide whether serious allegations
which the mother makes against the father are true. The allegations made by the
mother are, without needing to go into all of the details, that the father
physically, sexually and emotionally abused her during their 23 year
relationship, during most of which they were married. She also alleges that as
each of their five children were bom, he similarly abused them.

2.    
No
allegations of any kind were made by the mother, for example, to the police or
social services prior to the separation in 2011, however, after the separation
the mother sought help from agencies that specialise in helping and advising
people, mostly women, who are the victims of domestic violence. These included
the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and the Domestic
Violence and Abuse Service (DVAS).

3.    
Both
organisations of course do invaluable work in the context of assisting children
and vulnerable people, but it has been a consistent feature of the evidence
that this court has heard that certain professionals working in those agencies
habitually accepted, without question, the allegations made against this father
by the mother. They invariably accepted what she told them, uncritically and
without any attempt to examine or investigate the other side of the coin.

4.    
Exactly
the same applies to teachers at schools attended by A and B. Safeguarding
procedures were put in place at their schools which were completely
unnecessary. Had anyone from the children�s schools bothered to contact the
father, they would have almost certainly realised that he presented no risk or
danger, but inevitably the children were caught up in this hysterical and
paranoiac atmosphere.

5.    
There
is a very real danger, in my judgment, of professionals treating the alleged
victim�s allegations as being completely truthful and the alleged perpetrator
as a sort of pariah. All the allegations made by the mother in this case have
been found to be completely untrue, She, herself, has, since the separation,
been suffering from mental ill-health. She has been found to have influenced
the younger children and has caused them to be caught up in her hysterical
reaction to the father. The children have been seriously damaged in this
process and currently have no relationship with their father.

6.    
It
is not the purpose of this judgment, which is being delivered in open court and
may be reported, to have the particular workers involved and named. The purpose
is to cause all those who work in the area covered by this Care Centre, that is
Exeter, North and East Devon, with people who allege that they arc the victims
of domestic violence, to examine with care the way they work.

7.    
The
following points are offered as guidance;

(1)       
It
is essential at all times for professionals to keep an open mind. Allegations
of domestic violence are not proved simply by a person, however seemingly credible,
making an allegation or indeed several allegations.

(2)                
�Allegations
of domestic violence are usually proved, either

(a)                
�by
the alleged perpetrator's credible confession or

(b)                
�by
a competent court�s decision.

(3)                
�It
may be unhelpful to award praise when disclosures of abusive behaviour are
made, either by adults or children, because there is always the danger that
such disclosures are not true.

(4)                
�It
may also be unhelpful to children to carry out therapeutic work on them based
on unproved allegations of domestic violence. The first task should always be,
if possible, to establish the truth.

(5)                
�Professionals
need to be vigilant in dealing with an alleged victim of domestic violence to
ascertain whether he or she is suffering from mental ill-health and, if so, to
recommend immediate referral to a suitably qualified doctor;

(6)                
�It
is of course understood that agencies dealing with alleged victims of domestic
violence are in no position to carry out any forensic investigation into the
allegations, however, that does not mean that all allegations can simply be
accepted at face value, uncritically, as if the alleged victim is speaking the
truth. An appropriate examination of the allegations should always be carried
out, with appropriate challenge to the implausible or the incredible, the
far-fetched or the doubtful, and even after such a process an open mind should
still be retained;

(7)                
�This
court regards domestic violence, when proved, as being of the utmost
seriousness. Often it involves the exploitation of the vulnerable by a dominant
person. Often, when proved, it amounts to criminal behaviour. It causes massive
distress, often injury, and when children are involved they too often suffer
horrible abuse. Nothing that I have said above in any way diminishes the
seriousness of this kind of behaviour and the court's attitude to it, however,
it is almost as serious, in my judgment, for a person to invent allegations of
domestic violence and still worse for a parent to influence children that abuse
has occurred when it has not. This part of the judgment in this case is being
delivered in open court because that is what I have found has happened in this
case. The children involved have been so caught up in the toxic combination of
the mother�s false allegations, her hysterical reaction to the father and her
mental ill-health that the children have been completely estranged from their
father. It is going to require very skilled work to heal and restore;

(8)                
�Finally,
this must not happen again in the area covered by this Care Centre.

APPROVED JUDGMENT

 

 

 

Her
Honour Judge Katharine Marshall : 








 

1.     
This is a fact-finding hearing in care proceedings concerning K, a
little boy born on 11 July 2012, now aged 19 months.� His mother is (M) and his
father (F).� Both parents are parties to the proceedings.

 

2.     
M lives with the maternal great grandparents (MGGP) who have played a significant
role in her life, at times as her main carer.� The maternal grandmother is
(MGM).� F lives with his mother (PGM).�� 

 

3.     
M and F were in a relationship but separated very soon after K was
born.� They did not plan to have a child together, indeed M was not aware she
was pregnant for the first 3 months.� K was born prematurely, at 29 weeks
gestation.� He weighed 1.12kg at birth, and spent 7 weeks in the special care
baby unit.� He was discharged on 26 August 2012, having nearly doubled his
birth weight.

 

4.     
Following his discharge from hospital, K had regular follow up visits
from the health visitor and nursery nurse.� He was also seen on 3 occasions in
the neonatal clinic at Cirencester Hospital including on 21 March 2013.� On
that day, K presented at clinic as well with no concerns noted.� The consultant
paediatrician felt that K was making good progress; weight and development were
appropriate.� It is important to record that there have been no concerns raised
by any of the agencies about the care K was receiving throughout this period.� 

� 

5.     
In February 2013, M began a relationship with R.� R lives with his
mother.� M, at 24 years old, is some 5� years older than R who turned 19 earlier
this month.� M already knew R as he had been going out with F�s sister.� In
December 2012, they began to spend more time together.� Their friendship
developed to the point where F asked M to be his girlfriend in early to mid
February 2013.� The relationship ended as a result of these proceedings.� M
told the court that she had accepted the social worker�s advice that it would
be better if they were no longer together.� R had agreed.� Neither she nor R
saw the relationship being rekindled in the future.

 

6.     
R has been given permission to intervene in the fact-finding hearing.� He
is diagnosed as having ADHD and a psychological assessment has provided helpful
recommendations and guidance in working with him.� Permission was given for R
to be assisted by an intermediary provided by Communicourt. �The intermediary
has worked extremely hard to explain this very complex case to R. �I am told
she has formed the essential trusting rapport that has enabled him to
participate fairly and follow the issues in the trial, process information and
provide instructions.� She has also provided her expertise and advice to the
advocates and the court as to how best to meet R�s needs within these
proceedings, for which I am most grateful.

 

The precipitating events

 

7.     
On 21 March 2013, after K�s clinic visit, MGGM left the home to join
MGGF in Scotland for two weeks.� M had been anxious not to be on her own
throughout that period, and had asked F if he would like to spend time at
MGGP�s home, keeping her company and helping her with K.� It is not in dispute
that F had previously stayed with M when the MGGP�s were away at the end of
November 2012.� When F declined, M invited R instead.� R stayed with M and K at
MGGP�s house from 21 March until 7 April, with the exception of a few days when
they were all together at R�s home between 27-30 March and 2-3 April.� There
was an earlier period in 2013 when the MGGP�s were away, between 17 February
and 4 March 2013, when R may have spent some time with M and K at the MGGP�s,
possibly including overnight. �This is a matter the court may need to determine.

�

8.     
On 22 March, K was irritable and unsettled and failed to finish his
feed.� He was seen at Cirencester Hospital and M was advised he may have a
viral infection and to keep him hydrated.� The following day, K continued to
cry more than usual, did not want to be put down and was still not feeding well.�
M was concerned and took K back to the hospital.�� The diagnosis was a possible
tummy bug, virus, or teething.� It was noted that K had a high temperature and
again the advice was to keep K hydrated and administer calpol or ibuprofen.� M
gave K calpol.

 

9.     
Over the next two days, K was not seen to improve much, except briefly
after being given calpol, which seemed to make him sleepy.� On 26 March, K was
still no better, and M took him to her GP.� The GP suggested K might have
gastroenteritis and recommended ibuprofen rather than calpol.� M followed this
advice and K seemed better that night and the following day.� By 30 March, M
was no longer giving K ibuprofen.

� 

10.  K remained
improved, albeit not completely back to his usual self, until overnight between
2 and 3 April when K was crying and his condition appeared to have
deteriorated.� K was taken to be seen by the out of hours duty doctor, who
checked him over and indicated that K was fine.� At this visit, M mentioned
that K had been �rolling his eyes� in the previous week, something that he had
not done previously.� However, there is mention in the evidence that the MGGM
had also seen this, which suggests K may have been doing this before 22 March.�
The doctor did not consider this unusual.

 

11.  K was not
presented again to any health professionals until 7 April.� On this day, K was
at home with M and R.� The MGGP�s were due to return from Scotland, having been away, and M was tidying the house.� R was looking after K in another room
while M was busy with the housework, including hoovering.� At about midday, R
brought K to her, saying that there was something wrong with him.� M described
K as having turned grey, his hands were cold and he was floppy.� Although he
was looking at her, he seemed unable to focus.� M rang family members for
advice and help, and as K was still not responding, an ambulance was called.

 

12.  K was
taken to Great Western hospital in Swindon.� The paediatricians were ready to
meet him as the paramedics considered him sufficiently unwell to require a
�pre-alert�.� 

 

13.  On
admission to Great Western hospital, K was described as looking very unwell.�
His temperature, heart and breathing rate were all found to be low, his hands
and feet felt cool and he looked pale.� He was floppy, unresponsive and showed
a reduced level of consciousness.� Dr Bates considered him to be
�encephalopathic�, exhibiting brain dysfunction.� He was given fluids and
warmed, but although his temperature improved, his heart rate remained low.��
He was also given antibiotics and antiviral drugs in view of his presentation.�
His neurological status briefly improved.� However, this was short-lived and
his condition continued to be of concern.� 

 

14.  A CT scan of K�s head was carried out and revealed several areas of bleeding into and around
the brain.� K�s blood clotting profile was immediately checked but the tests
were normal.� K was given anti-convulsant medication in case the staring
episodes were seizure activity.

 

15.  Due to K
having a significant brain injury, arrangements were made for him to be
transferred to the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford into the care of the
Oxford Neurosurgical and Paediatric Intensive Care Team.� K arrived there in
the early hours of 8 April 2013.� The referral letter was written by Dr Mullett
and noted findings of the CT scan being �in keeping with acute on chronic
subdural haemorrhages�. A non-accidental injury was being considered within the
range possible causes.

�

16.  I pause at this stage to record my understanding from the medical
evidence of what is meant by acute and chronic subdural haematomas.� An �acute�
subdural haematoma occurs when there is fresh bleeding into the subdural spaces
in the brain. The blood is normally reabsorbed and disappears without trace.
However, in some cases the acute blood breaks down and becomes more watery,
exciting an inflammatory response within the subdural space which leads to the
development of fragile subdural membranes. Instead of the blood disappearing
the subdural space fills up with progressively more watery fluid.� There may be
episodes of spontaneous re-bleeding which may lead to the volume of fluid in
the subdural space becoming greater over time. This �chronic� subdural
haematoma develops over a period of at least two weeks.� An �acute on chronic�
haematoma indicates the presence of both fresh and old blood.

�

17.  On arrival
at the John Radcliffe hospital, K was noted to be alert with normal muscle
tone, and reacting appropriately.� K was reviewed by the paediatric
neurosurgical team later in the morning and his presentation remained good.�
Ophthalmological examination revealed no abnormalities.� An MRI scan reported
on by Dr K�ker confirmed the presence of bilateral subdural fluid collections,
the right side showing imaging characteristics that could indicate both acute
and chronic components.

� 

18.  Unfortunately,
K�s condition deteriorated overnight, he was drowsier, his heart rate was
dipping and he had vomited repeatedly.� The treating neurosurgeon, Dr Gatscher,
was concerned that K was suffering from raised intracranial pressure and
decided to operate to drain the fluid from the right side.� The operation took
place later that day and involved making a small hole in K�s skull.� Dr
Gatscher described how a medium sized solid blood clot evacuated itself, under
moderate to high pressure, followed by what she later described as �chronic
subdural fluid of engine oil colour�.� She irrigated the subdural space until
the fluid was clearer.� Following his operation, K recovered quickly and by the
next morning was feeding well, reacting and moving his limbs appropriately.

�

19.  A sample
of cerebrospinal fluid was sent for examination for pathogens, but nothing was
detected.� No pictures were taken or tests were requested or carried out to
confirm the presence or absence of chronic blood.

� 

20.  While K
remained in hospital, a sample of urine was analysed to check for glutaric
aciduria, and a full skeletal survey was carried out.� No abnormalities were
found.

 

21.  M and R
were both interviewed by the police on 11 April, but criminal proceedings were
not pursued.

Council (LA) commenced care proceedings in relation to K on 14 June 2013, over
2 months after they became involved.� It has taken some 8 months to get this
matter to a fact-finding hearing, two previous listings having been vacated due
to the complexity of the evidence and a need for additional expert evidence.�
As a result, the court is hearing evidence in relation to matters that occurred
nearly a year ago.

�

23.  This
hearing is to determine the most likely cause of the bleeding in K�s brain.�
The LA has set out the factual findings it seeks in its amended threshold
statement, a copy of which accompanies this judgment. 

�

24.  In summary, the issues for determination are:

 

a.       The nature
and extent of injuries sustained by K;

b.      Whether
the injuries, or any of them, were inflicted non-accidentally;

c.       If so,
whether there was one or more than one incident of inflicted non-accidental
injury;

d.      Whether
it is possible to identify the perpetrator(s) of any inflicted injury or
injuries;

e.       Failing
identification of perpetrator(s), the pool of potential perpetrators of any
inflicted injury or injuries;

f.       Consequential consideration of threshold criteria.

25.  The
respondent parties leave it to the court to determine the exact nature of the
injuries to K, and their likely cause.� Both M and R deny having caused K any
harm and M does not accept that she failed to protect K. �F has
no real active part to play in this hearing but hopes that the court will
provide some answers as to how his son came to suffer the injuries he did.� He does not take any position. The Children�s
Guardian�s role at this stage remains active exploration of the evidence and the
questioning of any anomalies or ambiguities within it.

 

The medical evidence

 

26.  In this
case I have been assisted by a number of expert witnesses covering a range of
disciplines; Dr Sprigg (Consultant Paediatric Radiologist), Mr Richards
(Consultant Paediatric Neurosurgeon), Dr Ward (Consultant Paediatrician) and Dr
Stoodley (Consultant Neuroradiologist).� They are all experienced practitioners
in their particular fields and seasoned expert witnesses in this type of case.�
I have also been provided with statements from treating clinicians including Dr
Bates (Specialist Registrar in Paediatrics), Dr Imam (Consultant Radiologist),
Dr K�ker (Consultant Neuroradiologist), Miss Gatscher (Consultant Paediatric
Neurosurgeon).� With the exception of Dr Imam, I heard oral evidence from all
of these witnesses.

� 

27.  In addition
I heard from Dr Mullett, who was a Registrar in his 5th year of
training in paediatrics at the time of K�s admission.� His evidence was
required to ascertain the origin of information in a note he had made on 7
April.� Having heard his evidence, I am not sure why it was necessary to call
this young man as a witness. In future, this sort of issue should be resolved
by way of correspondence.

 

28.  There have
been two experts meetings in this case, and a document setting out areas of
agreement and disagreement was prepared following the second meeting and
appears in the bundle at E297.� 

 

29.  Dr Sprigg
was instructed at the outset as a paediatric radiologist to report on the CT
and MRI imaging.� He has a special interest in paediatric neuro and skeletal
imaging.� When Dr Sprigg first reported on 26 August 2013, he identified recent
bleeding and fluid collections in the subdural area.� The recent or �acute�
blood was on both sides, but dominant on the right.� He also identified a small
volume of acute subarachnoid blood present on the right side. �He specifically
stated that there is no posterior fossa or spinal blood. 

� 

30.  He advised
that the bilateral fluid collections could be either acute traumatic effusions
or chronic subdural haematomas; imaging alone is unable to differentiate
between the two. �He observed that there were no positive imaging features to
confirm a chronic subdural haemorrhage.� There was no discernable change in the
size of the fluid space between CT and MRI scans, which is what usually
confirms an acute effusion. 

�

31.  He
confirmed that even if the acute subdural blood might be due to a re-bleed from
pre-existing chronic subdural haemorrhages, which he doubted due to the amount
and distribution, this cannot apply to the subarachnoid blood. The presence of
subarachnoid blood indicated that there must have been a recent traumatic
event. �He noted that all the imaging findings can be explained as the result
of a single recent forceful event.� 

�

32.  Dr Sprigg
had been able to review the ultrasound scans taken of K�s head at Gloucester
Royal Infirmary in July 2012 following his birth.� There was no evidence of
acute bleeding at that time that might have later presented as a chronic
subdural haematoma.

 

33.  At the
second experts meeting in January 2014, a note of which appears in the bundle
at E274 and having had the benefit of reading Dr Stoodley�s report, Dr Sprigg
amended his opinion, accepting Dr Stoodley�s conclusions in relation to the
presence of acute subdural bleeding in the posterior fossa, and also in the
area of the spine.� He was less convinced about some other areas of
subarachnoid bleeding that Dr Stoodley had identified including on the side of
K�s head, but they were both in agreement about the areas at the top of K�s
head.� It was put to Dr Sprigg in cross-examination that he had done a �volte-face�
in his evidence about bleeding over the posterior fossa and spine.� Dr Sprigg accepted
that he had changed his opinion, but said the evidence in relation to the spinal
imaging was �subtle but there�.

 

34.  Dr Sprigg
maintained his view that K�s injuries could be explained as originating from
just one recent event, but he could not exclude there having been two.� He was
willing to defer to the neuro-surgical team in relation to the identification
of the chronic subdural haematoma.�� 

 

35.  Mr
Richards also reported on 26 August 2013.� Mr Richards is currently employed by
the Oxford University Hospitals Trust, and unusually for an expert witness, had
some limited involvement in K�s care while in the John Radcliffe.� It seems
inevitable that this will happen from time to time, given the speciality and
the shortage of available expert witnesses.� K�s treatment was carried out
under the main supervision of another paediatric neurosurgeon but Mr Richards
would have seen K during routine ward rounds as part of the team.� He told the
court he has no specific memory of K.

 

36.  Mr
Richards reviewed the CT and MRI scans taken in April 2013, and the medical
notes of K�s treatment at both hospitals. In his report he noted that the fluid
removed during the operation was confirmed to be partially fresh blood, but
that it was unclear whether what had been seen on the scans was an acute
traumatic effusion or a chronic subdural haematoma.� He made no reference to
the potential relevance of any direct surgical observation of the fluid in
resolving this issue.� I anticipate that was because there was nothing recorded
in the notes to assist.� He observed that clinically there had been no increase
in K�s head circumference, or separated sutures, pointing more towards an acute
effusion.� Radiologically, it was his opinion that the fresh blood seemed to be
encapsulated by membranes which would favour chronic subdural haematoma, and �on
balance� he favoured that conclusion.

 

37.  If
correct, the presence of a chronic subdural haematoma indicated that there must
have been a previous acute subdural bleed.� Studies suggested that non-accidental
injury was by far the most common cause.� However, a chronic subdural haematoma
with acute blood present did not necessarily indicate more than one occasion of
trauma as the acute blood might be the result of a re-bleed.� Such bleeding can
be spontaneous.� However, if the fluid is an acute traumatic effusion, this
would indicate a recent injury.

 

38.  The trauma
required to cause bleeding is unknown, but clinical experience suggests it is
more than that normally encountered by an immobile infant, including during
normal handling.� Any incident would be likely memorable to a competent carer.

 

39.  Mr
Richards noted there were no other features of injury identified in K�s case
and reminded the court that one study had been unable to identify a cause of
subdural haematoma in 9% of cases.

 

40.  Mr
Richards was of the view it would not be possible to date the chronic subdural
collections.� The degree of change seen in a child following injury will depend
on the severity of the injury, and can range from catastrophic collapse to mild
irritation and a period of being unsettled.� He was unable to identify from K�s
past history any period when K was extremely unwell as might be expected
following a violent assault.� The possibility that K had been shaken could not
be excluded, but there was no positive evidence that this was the cause of the
chronic subdural haematoma.� He therefore described the cause at that time as
�unknown�.

 

41.  Mr
Richards�s conclusion was based on his opinion that the collections were chronic
subdural haematoma rather than acute effusions.� He did not identify or refer
to any other areas of acute subdural haemorrhage or subarachnoid bleeding. �At
the time he reported, he would not have had the benefit of Dr Sprigg�s report.

 

42.  In
evidence Mr Richards observed how the case had become increasingly complex with
the �increased radiological opinions�.� He acknowledged that his initial report
had been written on the basis that he had concluded that there was old blood
from an event some weeks before, causing pressure over the surface of K�s brain.�
The operation was to relieve that pressure.� Although Dr Sprigg had identified
possible recent subarachnoid blood, he pointed out that this had not been
raised by the treating team.� He told the court that he had asked two
colleagues to look at the scans and only one thought there was fresh
subarachnoid blood.� (I anticipate that he had not received the Court�s
instruction that he should not do that, but that an independent expert would be
appointed to assist on this issue).� The fact that Dr Stoodley then identified
subarachnoid blood, and more areas of recent bleeding not seen by Dr Sprigg which
he now agrees are there led him to describe the radiology as �confusing�.

 

43.  Mr
Richards reminded the court that the one person who had seen the fluid was Dr
Gatscher.� He said he had �questioned her on a number of occasions� and
that she was emphatic that she saw old blood.� As a neurosurgeon, he said it
was obvious to the naked eye whether blood was old or new and he would attach
great weight to what she had seen.� He described such observation as a
�diagnostic feature� and said that a laboratory test would not help.

� 

44.  Mr
Richards accepted the subdural abnormalities now identified by Dr Stoodley, but
was not convinced that he could agree that the areas of new blood identified by
Dr Stoodley were purely new blood, as it was possible they could be mixed with
some old.� He advocated caution in any event as old blood was more liquid and
could move from one part of the brain to another, possibly including down the
spine.� He was aware that he and Dr Stoodley did not agree on this issue.� 

�� ��

45.  Mr
Richards was asked about the lack of retinal haemorrhages and agreed that it
was not necessary for all three features of the �triad� to be present, but it
was still unusual not to find retinal haemorrhages.� In his own experience he
could not recall a clear case of non-accidental injury where retinal
haemorrhages were absent but the injury was fresh.� If what was being looked at
was an older injury, such signs could have completely resolved, or it could
represent an injury at the lower end of the scale.

�

46.  Mr
Richard�s did not adhere to the concept of K having a catastrophic collapse.�
He described him as a baby gradually coming more unwell due to the pressure in
his head as a result of an earlier incident that was probably at least two
weeks prior to K�s admission, possibly some weeks before.� His symptoms from 22
March could be due to the pressure building, or the earlier event itself.� He
explained that a shaken baby could present at the time as asymptomatic, or
stunned, or sleepy, or really unwell, or with catastrophic collapse.� This was
a feature of the complexity of the case. 

�

47.  Dr Ward
was instructed to provide a paediatric overview.� She filed a very
comprehensive report, having reviewed all of the records and papers.� She noted
that clinically K showed no abnormal neurological behaviour in the new born
period.� He was a small for gestational age infant, with a small head
circumference. �However, using the appropriate centile charts, he had remained
consistently on the 9th centile, with a slight tail off in his weight
and head circumference before he was admitted to hospital.� This was not a
�failure to thrive� case.

�

48.  Having
reviewed the clinical history, she concluded that it does not assist greatly in
resolving the issue of acute versus chronic subdural haematoma.� There was no
evidence of any sudden increase in head circumference at any time which might
be expected in a child with a chronic subdural haematoma, on the other hand,
the absence of such an effect did not exclude it being present.� She noted that
K was a healthy child until around 22 March.� It is possible that the symptoms
of lethargy, fever and poor feeding that appeared at that time marked the onset
of development of a chronic subdural haematoma.� However, Dr Ward could not
exclude the possibility of a coincidental viral or bacterial infection causing
these symptoms.� Dr Ward reminded the court that babies with subdural
haematoma�s can present very differently.

 

49.  K becoming
acutely ill on 7 April could represent an acute event such as shaking causing an
acute subdural bleed.� The child�s symptoms would more likely be immediately
apparent.� However an alternative explanation could be an increasing
intracranial pressure due to pre-existing chronic subdural haematoma leading to
acute deterioration.� In such a case, the symptoms would be obvious to a carer,
but not necessarily the cause.

 

50.  Dr Ward
confirmed in evidence that she did not doubt that there had been an acute event
on or around 7 April that had led to K�s collapse and the acute findings.� She
did not believe that a chronic bleed could be responsible for the sudden change
in K�s condition, absent some other reason such as a seizure.� K�s behaviour
was not consistent with that.� She found K�s symptoms on admission as described
by Dr Bates to be in keeping with disturbed brain function, or encephalopathy.��


 

51.  Dr Ward
comprehensively considered possible causes of subdural haematoma in infants,
and concluded that K was carefully investigated and no evidence of any
underlying haematological metabolic or other medical condition has emerged to explain
his clinical presentation and the neuro-imaging.� Like Mr Richards, she notes
that statistically trauma is the most likely cause in children of this age,
although there is no clear history of trauma in this case.� The absence of
retinal haemorrhages, often associated with subdural haematoma and encephalopathy,
does not exclude a non-accidental injury, but makes analysis of the case more
difficult.� She agreed with Mr Richards that it is possible that K was subject
to a shaking type injury, although the possibility of some other cause cannot
be ruled out.

 

52.  In her
evidence, Dr Ward referred to the Hobbs study that had looked at causes of
subdural haematoma�s in the under 2�s, leading to the statistic quoted by Mr Richards
that 9% of cases had an �unknown� cause.� She sounded a note of caution in
reading into this that trauma had been ruled out in all of these cases.� Some
may have had little information or inadequate investigation and had that not
been the case, the cause when known might yet be trauma. 

 

53.  It was at
the first experts meeting on 1 November 2013 that Mr Richards contributed
information not contained in his report to the effect that �anecdotally� the
surgeon who did the operation was of the opinion that the fluid removed was
chronic subdural fluid into which there had been an acute bleed.� He said �unfortunately
that was not written in the operative notes�.� This was considered by all
experts to be important information that had the potential to resolve the
issue.

 

54.  Further
discussion at that meeting had focused on the subarachnoid haemorrhage that Dr
Sprigg had identified in his report.� Mr Richards indicated that this had not
been picked up by the Oxford radiologists, nor had he picked it up, and he
would want to look at the scans again and seek the views of colleagues.� Dr
Sprigg was gently but appropriately pressing for this to be dealt with through
properly instructed independent opinion.� I have already recorded that in the
event, Neil Stoodley was instructed by the court to give an opinion on this
issue.

 

55.  Dr
Stoodley�s report came in on 17 December 2013.� He explains how fluid over the
surface of the brain lies in compartments separated by membranes.� Fluid in the
subarachnoid space is normal and entirely innocent.� Fluid in the subdural
space is always due to a pathological cause, such as infection or trauma.� The
appearance of blood on CT and MRI scans depends on many factors, but
particularly the length of time between the episode of bleeding and the scan
being performed.� Relatively fresh blood appears brighter than the underlying
brain on CT scans.� As the blood ages, it becomes progressively less bright,
and over a variable period of between 1 � 3 weeks, becomes the same attenuation
as the brain, before becoming darker.� The appearance of blood on MRI scans is
more complex, depending upon the time since the bleed and the specific scan
sequence used.� Other factors may also affect interpretation, such as the
dilution of the blood into a pre-existing fluid collection, or cerebrospinal
fluid leaking into the subdural space if the subarachnoid membrane is torn.� 

 

56.  Dr
Stoodley examined both the CT scans and the MRI scans, cross-referencing images
to inform his conclusions as follows.

� 

�The CT scan shows evidence of acute subdural haemorrhages
at several different sites, small amounts of acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and
probable acute traumatic effusions with no definite evidence of brain injury.�
The MRI scan confirms the findings on the CT scan in terms of the distribution
of acute subdural blood and probable effusions and also confirms the presence
of subarachnoid bleeding.� Imaging of the spine also demonstrates evidence of
subdural blood in the spinal canal.�

 

57.  Dr
Stoodley could not exclude the possibility that there was a chronic subdural
haematoma present, but noted, as Dr Sprigg had in his report, that all of the
injuries could be explained from a single episode of recent injury if the fluid
collection was in fact an acute effusion.� He explained in his evidence how
acute effusions can be routinely mistaken for chronic subdural haemorrhage.� He
could not absolutely differentiate between acute traumatic effusion and chronic
subdural haemorrhage on imaging, but identified that there were no positive imaging
features that would positively identify a chronic collection.� �He
also explained his view that Mr Richards had �misread� the normal cerebral
membrane anatomy as loculation.� Even if a chronic subdural bleed was
present, the distribution of the unequivocally acute recent blood, was not
explained by a re-bleed which would be expected to occur at the site of the
original bleed and as a lump, not spread out.� Dr Stoodley had identified on
the scans small but subtle areas of bright, fresh subdural blood which were not
associated with darker areas of old blood. 

 

58.  In
cross-examination Dr Stoodley was reminded about Dr Gastcher�s report, which
had been filed on 4 December 2013, where she described the fluid as �engine
oil�.� He commented on the subjectivity of such an assessment, and told the
court �anecdotally� of a case where such an assessment had been made, but when
lab tested, the contents were found to be only acute. ��

 

59.  Dr
Stoodley identified two clinical situations where small amounts of acute
subarachnoid blood are seen over the peripheral aspects of the infant brain,
either extensive hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, not seen in K, or trauma.�
Birth related bleeding is excluded for an acute subarachnoid bleed.

 

60.  The presence
of the spinal sub-dural haemorrhage Dr Stoodley found to be unequivocal and very
significant in terms of causation.� He described how such scanning is now
routine in many units in suspected non-accidental injury cases.� His own unit
also scan the spine in accidental head injury cases where an MRI has been
requested of the head.� The experience to date is that spinal subdurals are
seen in 50% of cases of alleged non-accidental injury, but are very unusual in
accidental injury cases where there has been no direct trauma to the spine.� This
particular research has not yet been published, but correlates with other recently
published studies.� Dr Stoodley was asked further about this in his oral
evidence.� He described it as an emerging area of study, but one that he felt
confident enough about to discuss in court.� He identified as a possible
mechanism bleeding caused by shearing of blood vessels around the base of the
spine.� He postulated that this area might be more likely to move if a child
was gripped around the upper body and shaken and that it could be considered as
a marker of mechanism of injury. �

 

61.  The type
of trauma likely necessary to account for the totality of the bleeding seen in
K could be an impact event involving a very significant degree of impact, but
unlikely against a hard surface given the absence of any visible impact injury.�
However, an impact injury is not required.� Dr Stoodley identified that this
pattern of acute subdural bleeds at several different sites is very commonly
seen in (but not pathognomonic for) non-accidental head injury involving a
shaking mechanism.� Subarachnoid bleeding is also very commonly found in cases
of shaking but is not always visible on scans and persists for much shorter
periods.

 

62.  Dr
Stoodley reminded the court that there is a range of expert opinion about what
action would be required to cause such injuries.� At the one end are those who
believe it requires a very violent act, at the other those who do not accept
this can occur by shaking alone.� He placed himself in the middle, with the majority
opinion.� He would place the overall severity of injury in this case towards
the lower end of the scale.

�

63.  In terms
of timing, he would assess from the MRI scans that the unequivocally acute
blood was no older than 2-3 days.� He indicated that the causative event is
likely to have occurred after the last time that the court is able to find as a
fact that K was behaving �neurologically� normally as there is likely to have
been a change in his neurological state at the time of the causative event. 

 

The factual evidence

 

64.  The court
bundle contains a number of statements and other documents providing factual
information in relation to the case.�� It was only necessary for me to hear
from a few of the treating clinicians.� I have already dealt with Dr Mullett�s
evidence.

 

65.  Dr Bates
attended to give evidence about K�s initial admission at Great Western.� She
had been working together with a junior colleague that day and they had met K
together on his arrival.� She confirmed that from the descriptions M and R had
given, although K had been unwell for a few days, the first �neurological�
symptoms had appeared earlier that day.� He was not unconscious or in need of
resuscitation, but she was satisfied that he was encephalopathic with a reduced
level of consciousness and responsiveness.� She described how he had a brief
period of recovery following him being given fluids and warmed up, but then
reverted to being drowsy, floppy and difficult to wake up.� The fact that he
did not pick up as much as expected she now considered was probably due to the neurological
symptoms, although at the time other possibilities, including infection, were
being considered.� Although there had been no definite evidence that K was
fitting, they had administered anti-convulsant drugs as a precaution.

66.  I heard from Ms Gatscher who
operated on K.� The important part of her evidence was in relation to what she
had observed when evacuating the fluid from K�s brain.� In the operation note
made at the time, she simply recorded �haematoma and fluid draining under
pressure�.� In a note made on K�s record on 9 April at 11am, she records �drainage
of acute subdural discussed with Mum�.� There is no description or
reference to the likely nature of the fluid extracted. 

67.  In evidence she accepted
that she had made no descriptive note, had not photographed the fluid or asked
for it to be examined to determine its content.� She explained that these were
not things she would normally do as they were not relevant to her treatment of
K, but she might consider doing so in future.� The operation was to remove the
acute blood clot which was thought to be causing K�s symptoms.� She noted that
he improved clinically, following the operation.� 

68.  In her report written for
these proceedings in December, she records �Intraoperatively, a medium sized
solid blood clot evacuated itself under moderate to high pressure followed by
chronic subdural fluid of engine oil colour.� This appears to be the first
time Ms Gatscher used the description �engine oil� which she agreed is a common
term among neurosurgeons.�� She did, apparently, use that description when
discussing matters with Mr Richards. 

69.  Ms Gatscher confirmed that there
would have been discussion among the neurosurgeon team after the operation or
the following morning. �Aside from this, she could only recall one conversation
with Mr Richards on this issue, around August/ September 2013 when he had told
her that he had been asked to write a report and could she remember her
findings.� I anticipate that is the conversation that Mr Richards referred to
at the experts meeting in November.� 

70.  Under
cross-examination, Ms Gatscher was able to explain to the court why she is
confident and really had no doubt that the fluid she saw contained old chronic
blood, which she now described from memory as a brownish reddish dark colour
and more liquid than the fresh blood clot that first evacuated through the burr
hole.� She told the court that the notes remind her that she irrigated the
space until the fluid was clear.� As a surgical procedure, this would only need
to be done if the fluid suggested the presence of old blood.� In other words,
if at the time, she had not observed what she now describes as �engine oil�,
she would not have taken the decision to irrigate.

 

71.  Dr K�ker�s
evidence was brief but helpful.� He confirmed that he had reported on MRI scans
and identified two components in the subdural collection which �could� indicate
a different time of occurrence.� In evidence he said that he had chosen his
words carefully.� Dr K�ker was entirely accepting that a radiologist of Dr
Stoodley�s expertise in his capacity as an expert reporting in the proceedings
may well have found subtle changes on the scans that he would not have picked
up in an emergency situation providing on-call scans to help the immediate
management of K�s clinical case.� 

 

72.  It was
only necessary to hear evidence from both M and R about the events leading up
to K�s admission.� A statement had been prepared by R�s mother, which has now
been filed and provides useful background information about her contact with
K.� It was not necessary to hear from her.

 

73.  M told the
court that K is the most important thing in her life, and she just wants him
home.�� She described him as a very easy baby to care for, who hardly ever
cries, which had surprised her.� She told the court how well K is developing,
having now caught up his milestones. He is walking, trying to run, eating well,
laughs, and beginning to string words together� She told the court about how
carefully K had needed handling when he was first born.� M told the court how
she is close to and supported by MGGP�s to whom she would turn for advice about
K, as well as her mother and other family members.� On Wednesdays and Saturdays
MGGP�s would care for K to allow her to spend time socialising with friends,
and to see R. 

 

74.  She was
asked by her counsel about the time when R was staying with her and K from 21
March.� Her evidence was that this would have been the first time that R had
spent any significant time with K, including overnight.� M could not think of
an occasion that she had left K alone with R at any time before then.

 

75.  Although
by this time their relationship had developed into a sexual one, it was M�s
evidence that they did not have sex during this period.� She moved into the
MGGP�s room, which had the double bed, taking K�s cot with her, and R slept in
the single bed in her room.� During the day, K would sleep in a cot downstairs
in the living room, until the last feed late evening, after which he would be
taken upstairs to the cot in the bedroom.� M would also go to bed at this time.�
If K woke in the night, M would wake R and he would help by getting K�s bottle
warmed while M changed K�s nappy.� She described how sometimes, R would sit
with her in bed as she fed K, and occasionally fall asleep there.� R was keen
and willing to help with K�s care, and M had shown him how to make up bottles
and feed K, and to change his nappy.� However, M said she did not expect R to
care for K, which she said was her role, and that even at this time she would
not leave K alone with R for anything but short periods of a few minutes, for
example while she went to the lavatory.�� 

 

76.  M
described how K became unwell.� It had started on 22 March, the day after the
MGGP�s had left.� She recalled K had woken up after a sleep crying.� M said she
had not heard K cry like this before.� She thought he was hot. �K settled after
a while, but M phoned the MGGM who advised that she should take K to hospital if
he had a high temperature. Over the next few days, M had sought help and been
given various explanations for what might be wrong with K, including a virus,
gastroenteritis, or teething.� She had found that he improved slightly when she
gave him ibuprofen, but there was a limit on this medication of 48 hours at a
time.� Throughout this period, K�s condition varied, and M described how he
would be better at some times than others.� He was not finishing his bottles,
and was sleepy for most of the time, difficult to put down and wanting to be
cuddled.� 

 

77.  They spent
27 � 30 March at R�s house, where R�s mother was able to help with K�s care.� K
was not 100%, but better than he had been.� They returned to MGGP�s house and on
1 April, as M was unable to settle K, MGM was called in after midnight, and stayed
overnight to assist.� MGM stayed in M�s room with K, and R joined M in MGGP�s
room. �I note that in her statement, M did not recall K being unwell, but just
difficult to settle.� The next morning she described him as �bright and
happy�. 

�

78.  On 3 April,
M again sought medical advice but was reassured.� They went to R�s house on
afternoon of 3 April and stayed there until 5 April.� 

����� 

79.  On the evening
of 6 April, M recalled that K had only drunk about half of his bottle, and she
thought he might well wake in the night.� She says, in fact he slept until
about 9 am.� The following morning, M confirmed it was R who took K downstairs
to prepare his bottle while she put on some clothes.� When she came down, she
found them asleep on the sofa, K lying on R�s chest.� K was then placed in his
cot where he slept for a while.� M accepted that she must have been upstairs
long enough for R to have fed and changed K, before they then fell asleep
together.

� 

80.  As MGGP�s
were due home that day, M was busy with housework.� She told the court that K
had just woken up, and as she was about to start hoovering, she asked R to look
after K in another room as he dislikes the noise.� R and K moved into the
smaller living room, and M described how she had handed K to R so that he was
sat on his lap, carefully held around his middle, as they watched television.� She
shut the doors, so that K would not hear the noise of the hoover, and accepted
that as a result she probably would not have heard K cry.� M continued with the
hoovering until R appeared with K.� She described how R passed K to her saying
�something is not right, K�s not right�.� She took K and spoke to him.� He felt
limp rather than floppy and was not moving his limbs.� She raised one of his
arms but there was not much response.� She described K as looking vacant.� He felt
quite cold, and she noticed a grey tinge around his mouth, eyes and face.� M
described how she felt worried, and confirmed that she had not seen K look like
this before.

 

81.  Her
immediate response was to call family members. �Her aunt and uncle quickly came
to assist.� An ambulance was called and K taken to hospital.

�

82.  I note
that the account she gave in her oral evidence of the events leading up to K�s
collapse on 7 April was broadly consistent with what is recorded in her police
interview, although it is not entirely clear whether K was sleeping in the same
room that night.� She said �He slept completely straight through until about
nine o�clock.� R woke up with him.� I woke up with him, because I went in and
looked and he was smiling at me�.� She described how K was in bed with her
for a morning cuddle.� He was getting a bit stroppy so R took him downstairs to
change and feed him.� When she came down they were quite happily asleep on the
sofa.� �So I kind of nudged R as if to say, you know, �Hello�; put K in his
cot�.� He didn�t sleep for long.� He played in his cot.�� She went on to
describe how she had to tidy and clean, and so asked R to take K into the
little room.� She left them there watching television.� In terms of timeframe,
M says she had been hoovering for 10 minutes or so, not long, before R brought
K to her. 

 

83.  M was
unable to think of any incident that might have caused K to sustain a head
injury.� She described an earlier incident when R had slipped coming downstairs
with K in his arms.� She had just seen his foot slip from where she was sitting
in the living room.� She thought R had gone upstairs to get nappies for K.� She
did not think it had resulted in any injury to K.� She had checked K and there
were no marks on him.� K had cried, but quickly settled.� When asked about the
timing of this incident, she could not remember, and wondered if it was before
the MGGP�s first visit to Scotland.

�

84.  Again,
this evidence is consistent with what she had told the police.� When asked in
interview if there had been any incidents that might have injured K�s head, she
said �I know R said .. actually I think I forgot to mention to you, he was
coming down the stairs with him and I think he might�ve slipped up a step.� He
didn�t fall over, but K didn�t bang himself.� That�s what he told me�.� A
little bit later she added �And as he came downstairs I heard a bit of a
stumble and I was like �Oh are you alright?� I heard K cry so I obviously
turned around, was like, �Is he alright?� He was like, �No, no, no, I hit my
elbow against the wall�.� After some further discussion M was asked if she
saw R fall and stumble and said �I saw his foot because the door was open.�
I saw his foot go, but I didn�t see anything else, just his foot.�� 

 

85.  M denied
having caused injury to K herself.� When it was put to her that if she had not
caused the injury, then inevitably it must be R, M understood the point being
made, but did not think that R could have done something to K.� She became
visibly upset at having to consider what might have happened to K and found it
too difficult to contemplate. I note that she started her police interview by
saying how it upset her hearing that someone might have hurt K.� She told the
officer how protective she was of K and that she would not let him go near
anybody she did not trust.� Later when asked how she would feel if it
transpired that someone was responsible for K�s injuries, she said �It would
kill me� before becoming upset.� She went on to say �Because I�ve
trusted someone who I thought I could trust with my son.� He means everything
to me, and if they�ve turned around and done that I wouldn�t even be able to
look at them, I couldn�t�.

 

86.  M told the
court that she was aware that R had ADHD and that the relationship between him
and his mother could be difficult at times.� She had been present together with
a friend of R�s when R had become angry with the friend and used a kitchen
knife to stab at some drawers in his room.� She had told him, in no uncertain terms,
to stop.� M confirmed that she was shocked but not scared and thought R had
overreacted, but she could not say why he had done this. Her initial evidence
was that she thought the friend had possibly wound R up. �It was later put to
her that R was angry that the friend had sat next to her on the bed and that
she had failed to give the court the full picture.� M denied misleading the
court, saying she had not been able to remember the reason.� M said that she
had only seen R get angry like this with his mother.� She did not believe that
R would behave like that around K.� Indeed, it was her evidence that R behaved
very differently at her house, where he was calm and happy and there had been
no problems.� She could not recall that they had any arguments during the two
weeks when R stayed.

� 

87.  M had been
asked in her interview about R and she said she knew he�d had problems and was
�troublesome� �I knew that, but I make kind of my own judgement.� I don�t
try and judge people knowing that�.� After some further discussion she
volunteered �I like to fix people, I suppose�. 

�

88.  M had
agreed with the social worker that there was little point in continuing the
relationship with R.� She said it had been hard to split up, but they remained
on friendly terms.� She saw no role for R in K�s life in future.

�

89.  I turn
next to R�s evidence.� In his statement, he starts by stating that he has not
hurt K on purpose, nor has he seen anyone else do that.� He maintained this
position when giving his evidence, confirming that he had not shaken, dropped,
hit or done anything to K to harm him.

� 

90.  R
confirmed M�s account of the occasion when he slipped on the stairs with K.� He
described how as he slipped, he held K to his chest to protect him, and that K
seemed OK.� He gives a detailed account of this incident in his police
interview, again reiterating that K did not hit anything, but was crying.� He
added �but he was crying, so we was worried for a while after that��. �I was
shaken, �cause for a few hours after that I couldn�t hold him because I was
scared: obviously �cause I slipped down the stairs.� I was scared to hold him
for a while, but then afterwards I managed to like hold him again and feed him,
but it was a bit hard.� It did shake me up, as well as him�.� When asked if
he thought this might be what had happened to K, he said ��he didn�t hit his
head on anything, but it might�ve just been from where I slipped down the
step.� Its like a bit of a bump so it might�ve like juddered him a bit�.

�� 

91.  In his
statement, he describes how although K was not his son, he loved and treated
him as if he were and was always calm and gentle with him.�� R acknowledged
that his ADHD and problems with his temper might lead to people thinking that
he had hurt K, but he described how different he was when with M and K.� When
giving evidence, he acknowledged that he has a difficult relationship with his
mother, that they argue a lot and that he would �get in her face�.� He
accepted that the police had been called once or twice.� �He confirmed that M
knew about his relationship with his mother.� He told the court that he had
conversations with both M and MGGM in which he was told that he must not get
angry and hit stuff if he was going to stay.� He also told the court that MGGM
knew about him self-harming by cutting his arm as they had a conversation about
it not long after the event.� He thought this was the first time he had met
her. 

 

92.  R was able
to recall the period when K was poorly for several days and not sleeping well.�
He agreed that as a result, he and M had been tired.� He tried to help during
the night to take the pressure off M, and may have fallen asleep on a couple of
occasions when feeding K, but he denied having dropped K.� Both he and M were
worried about K, and he said neither of them lost their temper with him, but
remained gentle.� He accepted that K was a little bit harder to look after when
he was unwell, crying more than usual.� However, he described K as being
alright in the two nights before he went into hospital.� He was going to sleep
better, and sleeping longer.

 

93.  The days
they spent at his mother�s house during that period, gave them both some rest
as R�s mother helped with feeding and nappy changing.

 

94.  R was
asked in his oral evidence to give an account of the events leading up to K
being taken to hospital.� He would not recall who had fed K on the Saturday
evening, but thought it might have been him.� They went to bed, but he was not
sure where he slept.� Later in cross examination he said he had been in M�s
room and had slept through because he was tired as K had been waking up at
night.� He thought K was in MGGP�s room.� He remembered waking the next morning
and said that M came in and woke him up. K needed feeding, so he took him
downstairs to change and warm K�s bottle.� He was asked if this was the first
time he had done that much caring for K, and thought it was, but then said
possibly there had been occasions before when he had taken K downstairs while M
got dressed.� He gave an account of rather efficiently putting on the kettle to
heat the bottle while he changed the nappy, which might suggest he had done
this routine before.� 

 

95.  �He
confirmed that he and K had fallen asleep on the sofa after K had finished his
feed, and that M came down and woke him, and K was put in his cot.� R then went
outside for a cigarette.� He was not sure if K was asleep or playing in the
cot.� He thought he had sat and watched TV for a while.� He recalled M asking
him to take K into the front room while she got on with the hoovering.� He gave
a similar account to M of being sat on the sofa with K securely held while they
watched TV.� He said variously that K was happy, had been playing with his
teething toy, and also that K had started to whine, so he walked around the
room to try to settle him.� At this time, R described how K was moving, kicking
his legs and swinging his arms.� He said that K started to go quiet, �went
funny on me, all floppy and really pale, I had not seen K like that before�.� He
denied doing anything to cause K to go floppy.� 

� 

96.  R was
interviewed by the police on 11 April 2013.� He had been offered but declined a
solicitor, and had no-one to assist him in the way he has been assisted in
these proceedings.� He confirmed in his oral evidence that what he had said in
his police interview was true. 

�

97.  He gave an
account in that interview, fairly consistent with his oral evidence, of how he
had care of K while M was hoovering.� He said that K had just woken up, but had
milk before, so M asked him to take K into the front room away from the noise.�
In the course of the interview, R gave descriptions of what happened while he
was looking after K in the front room:

 

�And I was just like holding him
and then he started to cry so I � I was holding him and started to walk around
the room with him because he likes being walked around �. And then he went
quiet.� I looked at him and then he was just all of a sudden he just went all
floppy, and I didn�t know what to do so I ran in���I looked at him and like his
eyes were closed, but then I went �K� and he opened them, but he was like eye
rolling to the back of his head���that�s not him, he doesn�t do that� �as soon
as I seen he was all floppy I was just scared, and I was just �what the f� am I
going to do?� �I was walking around, cause he likes it,�and he normally settles,
but I wasn�t like rocking him in my arm�.� �There�s nothing that happened that
could have done anything to him.� It just happened so randomly I was like
�What�s going on�, cause it wasn�t him, and he completely fine like two minutes
before he started crying, and he was playing with his toy�.

98.  In the course of his
evidence, I invited R to demonstrate how he was holding K as he walked around,
and contrary to what he said in his interview, he said that he was gently
rocking him, and showed me how he moved his arms up and down.� 

99.  R sent his mother a text
asking what he should do, and she replied to call 999.� When the ambulance
arrived, R said he had to walk out because it was all �too much�.� He clearly
found it stressful.

100.     R was
asked about when he might have stayed with M and K before the 2 week period at
the end of March.� Initially, he thought he had been there once before when the
MGGP�s had been away for 5 days, but he could not remember exactly.� He thought
it was in the same month that K became ill.� He said he had not done much
looking after K during that period, changed his nappy and fed him perhaps
once.� He denied having looked after K at night.� When cross-examined on behalf
of M, he was unsure about the timing he had given, and said it was possible
that he had only stayed one night, or even that he had gone home and not
stayed.� He said �Her memory is much better than mine�.� I note in his
police interview he said �I see him (K) quite a bit, but I only like go over
when her granny goes to Scotland �. To help her out and be company for her ..
and that�s only for like two weeks at a time� every now and then when her
granny goes away�.� Later on, when recalling the occasion when he slipped
coming downstairs he said �but not this time when I was at her granny�s, but
like I think I had two week � I went back home for two weeks, and then her
granny went away again this time�.

101.    
In evidence, R was asked about how much time he had spent with K, and
said that when he and M were just friends, he did not go to her house, she
would come to visit him, but not with K.� He also said at one point that he
thought the first time he had met K was when the MGGP�s were away.� He has a
picture of the first time he met K, which when asked about, he thought was
taken at MGGP�s house.�� However, he also confirmed that there was a time when
M had come to his house with K and stayed overnight, following an argument with
MGGP�s.� He then thought that might have been the first time he met K.� He said
that there were occasions when M would bring K to the house and catch up on
sleep while he and his mother looked after K.� He denied that he had been left alone
looking after K at this time.�� I note that in his statement R makes a general
comment that he did a lot of the care of K, including night feeds and changing
nappies.

102.     He was asked
in cross examination about the incident at his house when he had stabbed the
drawers in his bedroom with a kitchen knife, causing damage.� This had been in
December, before he and M were going out as boyfriend and girlfriend.� He confirmed
it was a case of jealousy. �He remembered M had got annoyed with him and told
him to shut up and sit down.

103.     He was
also asked about an incident in January when he had cut his arms after he and M
had �argued� in a text conversation and had been taken to hospital.� On this
occasion, it had been M getting jealous about him talking to other girls.� R
said things were not right at home at this time and he had been depressed.� He
said that M had thought he was attention seeking.

104.     It was put
to R that he had previously smoked a lot of cannabis, which he accepted.�
However, he told the court that he had not smoked around M and K, or at MGGP�s,
and not at all in the 2 weeks when he was staying with M.� He said he did not
notice any affect due to not smoking as K kept him happy and busy and he did
not think about it.

105.     R
described M as coping very well with K.� He said �she loves him, he�s her
world completely�.� He had accepted that the relationship should end.� Like
M, he did not think that they would get back together in the future.

 

Applicable legal principles

 

106.    
I have reminded myself of the relevant legal
principles that apply when making factual findings in cases such as this, which
I summarise as follows.

 

a)     
First, the burden of proof lies at all times with
the local authority.

�

b)     
Secondly, the standard of proof is the balance of
probabilities

 

�In
our legal system, if a judge finds it more likely than not that something did
take place, then it is treated as having taken place. If he finds it more
likely than not that it did not take place, then it is treated as not having
taken place. He is not allowed to sit on the fence. He has to find for one side
or the other. Sometimes the burden of proof will come to his rescue. The party
with the burden of showing that something took place will not have satisfied
him that it did, but generally speaking, a judge is able to make up his mind
where the truth lies without needing to rely on the burden of proof.'

�

c)     
Third, findings of fact in these cases must be
based on evidence, including inferences that can properly be drawn from the
evidence and not on suspicion or speculation. Judges are guided by many
things, including the inherent probabilities, any contemporaneous documentation
or records, any circumstantial evidence tending to support one account rather
than the other, and their overall impression of the characters and motivations
of the witnesses."Common-sense, not law, requires that
in deciding this question, regard should be had to whatever extent is
appropriate to inherent probabilities"

 

d)    
Fourthly, when considering cases of suspected child
abuse the court must take into account all the evidence and furthermore
consider each piece of evidence in the context of all the other evidence. The
court invariably surveys a wide canvas. A judge in these difficult cases must
have regard to the relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence and to
exercise an overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to the
conclusion whether the case put forward by the local authority has been made
out to the appropriate standard of proof.

 

e)     
Fifthly, amongst the evidence received in this
case, as is invariably the case in proceedings involving allegations of
non-accidental head injury, is expert medical evidence from a variety of
specialists. Whilst appropriate attention must be paid to the opinion of
medical experts, those opinions need to be considered in the context of all the
other evidence. It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the
expert are distinct and it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the
expert evidence against its findings on the other evidence.  It is the
judge who makes the final decision.

 

f)       Sixth, cases involving an allegation of non-accidental injury often
involve a multi-disciplinary analysis of the medical information conducted by a
group of specialists, each bringing their own expertise to bear on the problem.
The court must be careful to ensure that each expert keeps within the bounds of
their own expertise and defers, where appropriate, to the expertise of others. It
is also important that experts indicate where their opinion may be new, not
mainstream, or not subject to peer reviewed research.

 

g)     
Seventh, the evidence of the parents and any other carers
is of the utmost importance. It is essential that the court forms a clear
assessment of their credibility and reliability.� Indeed this applies to all
such assessments of factual testimony. �The assessment of credibility
generally involves wider problems than mere �demeanour� which is mostly
concerned with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now
believes it to be. With every day that passes the memory becomes fainter and
the imagination becomes more active. The human capacity for honestly believing
something which bears no relation to what actually happened is unlimited.
Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost importance;� 

 

h)     
Eighth, it is common for witnesses in these cases
to tell lies in the course of the investigation and the hearing. The court must
be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for many reasons, such as
shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear and distress, and the fact that a witness
has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about
everything (see R v Lucas [1981] QB 720).

�

i)       
Ninth, recent case law has emphasised the
importance of taking into account, to the extent that it is appropriate in any
case, the possibility of the unknown cause. 

(1) The cause of
an injury or an episode that cannot be explained scientifically remains
equivocal.

����� (2) Recurrence is not in itself probative.

����� (3) Particular caution is necessary in any case where the medical
experts ������ disagree, one opinion declined to exclude a reasonable
possibility of natural ����� cause. 

����� (4) The court must always be on the guard against the
over-dogmatic expert,  the expert whose reputation is at stake or the expert
who has developed a  scientific prejudice. 

����� (5) The judge in care proceedings must never forget that today's
medical ������� certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts or
that scientific ��� research would throw a light into corners that are at
present dark. 

 

"What
may be unexplained today may be perfectly well understood tomorrow. Until then,
any tendency to dogmatise should be met with an answering challenge."�


�Even where, on examination of all the evidence, every possible known
cause has been excluded, the cause may still remain unknown."

�There
has to be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving
rise to significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is
unknown.  That affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. 
It is simply a factor to be taken into account in deciding whether the
causation advanced by the one shouldering the burden of proof is established on
the balance of probabilities."

 


j)       
Tenth, when seeking to identify the perpetrators of
non-accidental injuries the test of whether a particular person is in the pool
of possible perpetrators is whether there is a likelihood or a real possibility
that he or she was the perpetrator.  In order to make a finding that a
particular person was the perpetrator of non-accidental injury the court must
be satisfied on a balance of probabilities. It is always desirable, where
possible, for the perpetrator of non-accidental injury to be identified both in
the public interest and in the interest of the child, although where it is
impossible for a judge to find on the balance of probabilities, for example
that Parent A rather than Parent B caused the injury, then neither can be
excluded from the pool and the judge should not strain to do so

�

k)     
Finally, when considering the issue of whether the
threshold is met, I remind myself that the elements required to be
proved are that the child has suffered significant harm attributable to the
care given to the children not being what it would be reasonable to expect a
parent to give. As per Ryder LJ in : Re S (A Child) [2014] EWCA Civ 25
at para 20 � 22;

�The court's function is to make the
findings of fact that it is able on the evidence and then analyse those
findings against the statutory formulation.� The gloss imported by the use of
unexplained legal, clinical or colloquial terms is not helpful to that exercise
nor is it necessary for the purposes of section 31(2) to characterise the fact
of what happened as negligence, recklessness or in any other way.� Just as
non-accidental injury is a tautology, 'accidental injury' is an oxymoron that
is unhelpful as a description.� If, as is often the case when a clinical expert
describes harm as being a 'non-accidental injury', there is a range of factual
possibilities, those possibilities should be explored with the expert and the
witnesses so that the court can understand which, if any, described mechanism
is compatible with the presentation of harm�.� 

�The
threshold is not concerned with intent or blame; it is concerned with whether
the objective standard of care which it would be reasonable to expect for the child
in question has not been provided so that the harm suffered is attributable to
the care actually provided.� The judge is not limited to the way the case is
put by the local authority but if options are not adequately explored a judge
may find a vital piece of the jigsaw missing when s/he comes to look at all the
evidence in the round.� 

 

�..all that
is required in a case of this kind is for the court, legal practitioners and
experts to have regard to the statutory formulation with which the court is concerned.�
If other terminology is used in evidence its meaning should be precisely
ascertained so that the court knows what is being alleged and advised.�

� 

107.    
I have applied these principles, as I have considered the evidence in
relation to the factual findings sought.� 

 

Analysis of the evidence 

 

108.    
The experts are all agreed that this is a complex and unusual case which requires very careful
analysis of all of the evidence.� It is a case that rests to a large extent on
interpretation of the neuroradiology in relation to identifying K�s injuries,
but I remind myself that the court must take into account all of the evidence
when considering the various possibilities.

 

109.    
I start by considering the medical evidence and the issues that are
agreed, as well as those not agreed by the experts.

� 

110.    
The experts agree that scans show evidence of fluid collections on both
sides of the head and recent bleeding in the subdural and subarachnoid space
close to the fluid collections.� The experts are not in agreement as to whether
the bleeding or some of it could be a case of re-bleeding.

 

111.    
All experts agree that a re-bleed into a pre-existing chronic subdural
haemorrhage can occur �apparently spontaneously�, i.e. it can be due to an
event that is so minor that it goes unnoticed or is not memorable.� It is not
agreed that this could apply in K�s case given the dramatic way K presented.� 

 

112.    
The experts are not in agreement as to whether there has been chronic
subdural haematoma.� The radiologists both agree that it is not possible to differentiate
between acute traumatic effusion and chronic subdural haematoma from imaging,
but that it is possible to explain all of K�s injuries from one recent incident
if the fluid is acute traumatic effusion.

 

113.    
It is agreed that there has been recent bleeding in the subdural area of
the posterior fossa and the spine.� This therefore points towards there being
an acute event at the time of the K�s presentation, regardless of whether a
chronic subdural haemorrhage is present or not.

 

114.    
The radiologists are agreed that there has been an acute bleed in the
subarachnoid space.� Dr Ward accepts their interpretation on this issue.� Mr
Richards is of the opinion that there might or might not have been such a
bleed.� He takes this position as a result of the inconsistencies in the
radiological reports he has seen.

 

115.    
It is agreed that K did not suffer from retinal haemorrhage.� If there
was a retinal haemorrhage present with an earlier event, it might have resolved
by the time of a later re-bleed.� 

 

116.    
Depending on whether the Court finds that the subdural and subarachnoid
blood to be acute, chronic or a mixture of both, the experts agree the court
will be able to establish whether the causative event was a single incident or
a number of successive incidents.� The experts are in agreement that there
might have been more than one injury, but certainly one of the potential
injuries must have been non-accidental. 

 

117.    
As to the nature of the causative event, it was agreed that
statistically the commonest cause of this type of symptoms is a shaking injury.�
Other causes are possible but none was identified as present in K�s case.� Although the minimum force required to cause an acute subdural is not
known, clinical experience would suggest that it has to be at a level higher
than encountered in normal everyday life and would normally only be expected as
a result of events memorable to parents.� In this case, it is agreed
that excessive / inappropriate handling must have occurred and that it most
likely led to a shaking injury.� It is unclear in this case if the incident
included a �throw-down� component, but that is largely irrelevant.� 

 

118.    
All experts are also in agreement as to the absence of other injuries.�
This, however, does not assist in determining whether the injuries are accidental
or otherwise.� It is well recognised that shaking injuries can present without
retinal haemorrhage.� 

 

119.    
The experts agree that there are no organic underlying causes for the
bleeding (e.g. factor protein deficiencies, Menkes disease).� 

 

120.    
There is agreement between the experts that the child suffered from
encephalopathy.� However, encephalopathy is a very broad term implying
disturbance in the brain function; it is not a specific condition.� All the
experts agree that there must have been a change in the neurological state of
the child at the time of the causative event.� 

 

121.    
I turn next to consider the factual evidence, and I start with the
evidence about K�s admission and treatment.

 

122.    
Dr Bates descriptions of K at the time of admission and her assessment
of K as being encephalopathic is not in dispute.

�

123.    
The radiologists were asked to report on scans performed at both Great
Western and John Radcliffe hospitals.� Dr Imam at Great Western, a District
General Radiologist without paediatric or neuro-radiological specialism,
identified acute on chronic collections from the CT scans.� Dr K�ker carefully
worded his report on the MRI scans.� Both were looking at different sets of
scans.� Their primary purpose was to assist and inform the treating clinicians,
not to carry out a detailed forensic analysis at that time.� 

�

124.    
Dr Gatscher�s evidence was of great assistance, particularly given the
difficulty posed in this case by the inability of imaging to differentiate
between chronic subdural haematoma and acute effusion.� What Ms Gatscher was
able to observe was the actual fluid present in K�s head, that created the
imaging seen by the radiologists.� I am persuaded that observations of what was
drained from K�s skull during the operation are likely to be the most probative
evidence in relation to this issue, which is something that Mr Richards appears
to have realised early on in this case.� The significance it has now acquired
is a fact she will have been aware of when she came to give her evidence.

 

125.    
Dr Gatscher was really in no doubt that what she saw, in addition to the
recent clot, was fluid containing old blood.� However, this evidence is given
from her memory of an operation conducted in April 2013, nearly a year ago and
the notes she made at the time provide no description of the fluid to assist in
refreshing that memory.� I remind myself that Ms Gatscher�s role was to treat K
by performing an operation considered necessary to relieve pressure on his
brain and no doubt that was her primary focus.� It is only later, as a result
of these proceedings that the issue of the nature of the fluid has become
important.

�

126.    
A further complicating factor is that Mr Richards has questioned Ms Gatscher
specifically on this issue; in his evidence he said he had asked her �on a number
of occasions�.� Dr Gatscher thought that they had only discussed it once, last
year.� When told that Mr Richards had referred to discussions on a number of
occasions, she confirmed that she was �asked several times�.� Indeed, Mr
Richards when asked to set out who he has discussed this case with, and the
nature of those discussions, confirms that he had several discussions with Ms
Gatscher, both pre and post-dating his instruction in the case, concerning the
nature of the fluid �being aware of its importance to the case�.� It
appears that one of these conversations took place after Ms Gatscher had
written her report in which she referred to engine oil, the purpose of which
was to specifically ask if she was referring to new engine oil or old engine
oil.

�

127.    
In the light of this, I do have to take into account that Mr Richards
has conducted conversations with Ms Gatscher, an important witness of fact, that
are unrecorded, and what impact that may or may not have on the weight that I
can ascribe to her evidence.� I make it absolutely clear that I am not
suggesting any deliberate interference, but concerned about that which can
naturally arise when a witness is questioned, particularly if it is several
times, about matters of recollection.

 

128.    
I have no doubt that it is the fact that Mr Richards and Ms Gatscher are
part of the same neurosurgical team and Mr Richards� realisation that this is a
pivotal piece of evidence that would assist the court that led to Mr Richards
approaching her directly.� It is not an issue that such a conversation might
already have taken place at the time of K�s operation within the reviewing team
of which Mr Richards would have been a member.� However, once Mr Richards had
accepted an instruction as an expert witness reporting to the court on these
issues, he should have been alive to the need to adhere to the usual
proprieties about obtaining important factual evidence from a witness for the
expert to comment on.� It would have been helpful if he had raised this issue
in his report and suggested that a report or statement be obtained from Ms
Gatscher, which I could have directed be done at an earlier stage.� Once that
report had been obtained, if further questions needed to be asked of Ms
Gatscher, again that could have been done through the appropriate processes. ��

 

129.    
In the circumstances, were it not for Ms Gatscher�s evidence that she
would not have irrigated K�s brain had she not formed a view at the time that
this was chronic blood, I would have been very cautious in relying upon Ms Gatscher�s
recollection now of what she saw in April 2013.� The evidence about irrigation
is clearly documented at the time, I can be certain is unaffected by Mr Richards
involvement, is a clinical procedure that would not otherwise have been carried
out.� In the circumstances, I can accept Ms Gatscher�s evidence in so far as it
confirms her subjective assessment of the nature of the fluid.

 

130.    
I turn next to consider the evidence of M and R.� Both are young, R only
just 19.� Both are aware of the significance of these proceedings, not just for
K, but for themselves in the future. They are no longer in a relationship, but
remain friends.� R still has pictures of K at home.� I could not help but
notice M�s expression as R was giving evidence, which appeared to me to
demonstrate a high level of residual affection for him.� Neither has
specifically blamed the other, although each is aware of the implication of
being in a pool of perpetrators that contains only them.

�

131.    
Neither is able to given an account of any incident that, in the light
of the expert evidence, could account for the significant and sudden
deterioration in K�s presentation on 7 April.� Other than the remembered slip
down the stairs on an earlier occasion, there is no history of a fall, or of K
being dropped which could account for his injuries.

�

132.    
M came across as engaging, likeable and warm.� Her love for and
commitment to K was evident as she spoke about him.� By April 2013 she had been
caring for K for 8 months, a baby that needed special care which the evidence
suggests she was providing.� I accept her evidence, confirmed by R, that K was
an easy baby to care for and that she was in her eyes �protective� of him.� In
her police interview she talked about only letting him near people that she
trusted.� She also found caring for K tiring at times, as might any mother in
her situation, and relied upon the support of MGGP�s, and in their absence,
invited others to help her, including R.

�

133.    
However, as I listened to her evidence, I became less convinced that she
was giving a wholly truthful account.� There were points where her evidence was
inconsistent and at other times evasive.� It is often the case that witnesses
in M�s position will try to play down the less favourable evidence, and seek to
portray themselves in the most positive way.� M�s evidence was exactly that in
relation to what she knew about R, the incident with the knife and the episode
of self-harming.� The more honest account on those issues is in her police
interview.� That is something that has to be factored in when considering M�s
credibility.� However, I remind myself that it does not follow that because she
has been economical with the truth about some matters that she is lying about
the most important issue, what happened to K. 

 

134.     I found R,
for all his acknowledged difficulties, to have presented his evidence in a
straight-forward manner, by and large answering the questions put to him to the
best of his ability with the outward intention of providing a full and honest
account.� I take into account his police interview, that was given without
assistance and which he was able now to confirm was accurate.� He is aware of
his memory problems and the limitations that brings to his ability to
accurately date or sequence events. It also became evident that he could easily
be persuaded to amend his evidence in circumstances where it was suggested that
he might be mistaken and others to have a better recall.� It is submitted on
his behalf that this is clear evidence of the Communicourt and psychological
assessment being accurate of his memory and processing problems, rather than
contrived evidence.� I was concerned that there was an element of R seeking to
say what he thought M was wanting him to say, but having said that, on other
occasions he gave a different, possibly more accurate picture than M.� Generally,
I found him to be doing his best.

�

135.    
M and R�s evidence about the level of his involvement with K, and if and
when he might have had sole care of K was unclear and confused.� I am satisfied
that M did spend time at R�s mother�s house and took K there on occasions,
including on one occasion, staying overnight.� R�s mother would assist in
caring for K, including looking after him either with R, or on her own.� This
evidence was confirmed by R�s mother in her statement, and R.

 

136.    
By the end of the period when R was staying with M in March/April, the
evidence from both M and R is that he was undertaking feeding and nappy
changing to support M, including at night.� On the morning of 7 April, he was
doing this downstairs while M was upstairs, probably for some considerable time.�
I have already observed that it is likely this was not the first time that he
managed these tasks.� 

� 

137.    
I have considered the evidence about the earlier occasion when the
MGGP�s were away.� R�s evidence initially was that he had stayed, he thought
for about 5 days.� He then pulled back from that, became unsure if he had
stayed at all and deferring to M�s recollection.� Considered in the light of
the accounts given by both M and R in their police interviews, I think there is
little doubt that R had previously stayed, and that would have been earlier in
February/March as the MGGM has now confirmed, at a point when their
relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend was very new.� That was R�s clear evidence
in his police interview, and he was able to be pretty accurate about the
timing. I am also satisfied that it is during this period that the incident of
R falling on the stairs while holding K occurred.� I have considered why it
would be that R, who had apparently had little contact with or care of K before
this time would be taking him upstairs to collect nappies?� Whatever the
reason, this evidence supports a conclusion that contrary to what she has said,
M was allowing R to be more significantly involved in the care of K early on in
their relationship and that there may well have been short periods when R was
left alone with K unsupervised.

�

138.    
By the time R came to stay for the second time, the evidence suggests
that he had an even greater role.� I am satisfied that M particularly, and R to
a lesser extent, have deliberately downplayed their accounts on the issue of
R�s involvement in the care of K. 

 

139.    
I have gone over their accounts of the events of the morning of 7
April.� It is important that neither of them has described any concerns about K
that morning when he woke up, apart from being a little grouchy as he was
hungry.� Both said that K�s condition had improved and he had appeared to be
nearly back to his normal happy self in the last couple of days.� There is no
reason to doubt that evidence.

� 

140.    
I have already identified that R had the early care of K in the absence
of M.� It is not clear how long she was upstairs or what she was doing before
she came down, but long enough for K to have been fed, changed and for both to
have fallen back to sleep.� Both agree that when she did come down and wake up
R, K was returned to his cot and they went outside for a cigarette.� What
happens next is unclear.� In their accounts to the police, and their evidence
in these proceedings, neither M nor R has been clear about what K was doing, or
indeed what they were doing, between K being returned to his cot and being
taken into the front room. At first glance, there appears to be a considerable
period of time unaccounted for.� I have considered whether it is possible that
in fact there isn�t a missing period.� I was not convinced by M�s evidence that
she was only upstairs for a few minutes.� It may well have been much longer
than that.� There is no evidence about how long R had been asleep downstairs
with K.�� 

 

141.    
Even allowing for the need to treat R�s evidence with some care, his
accounts in evidence and in his police interview of how K was in the morning
and how K became while they were in the front room has been reasonably
consistent.� If M and R are telling the truth about these events, then the change
he saw in K happened while K was in his care, and M was elsewhere.� It suggests
a pretty swift change in K that, taken with Dr Bates assessment, was likely in
his neurological functioning.� However, R has told the court that nothing
happened to K that could explain this.� On his account, it appears that K had
been playing with a toy minutes before he went quiet and floppy.� This is at
odds with the medical evidence, particularly that of Dr Ward, that there must
have been an acute event at or shortly before K went limp, and the agreed
expert view that the event involved a significant trauma.� I have to consider
whether the medical evidence is so convincing that R must be lying and
concealing the true picture, or whether R�s account is sufficiently convincing
that it should be accepted and the medical evidence rejected.

 

142.    
There is nothing in R�s evidence that suggests he has deliberately lied,
except in so far as I found him to be amenable to supporting M�s preferred
accounts.� On the other hand, had something happened to K that inflicted a head
injury, with all the consequent events, there is a strong motive for someone in
R�s position not to tell the truth about it. �It does not necessarily mean that
K has been deliberately injured, although that might be the case.� It is also
possible that injuries to K might have been the result of what might be
described as negligent accident, something that should not have happened if the
child had been handled appropriately.� The experts agree that the injuries are
at the less serious end of the scale.

 

143.    
I take into account that for a significant
proportion of the two weeks preceding 7 April, K had been unwell and causing
both M and R to be concerned, to suffer poor sleep and tiredness while at the
same time needing to deliver to him a higher level of care and attention than
normal.� That they were finding this a struggle is a reasonable inference to be
drawn not only from their seeking support from others in caring for K,
including MGM and R�s mother, but also that they made several visits to seek
medical advice.� 

 

Findings

 

144.    
I turn finally to my findings.� At the close of proceedings, I identify
the issues that require determination are as follows:

 

a.      
Does the court accept the agreed expert opinion about the injuries
that K has suffered?

�������� I
can find no reason not to accept the agreed expert opinion in relation to K�s
injuries.� All the experts have in mind the possibility that
there are cases where the cause of injuries such as that suffered by K remain
an unspecified cause, but I am satisfied in this case the evidence is not such
as to support a finding that this is one of them. ��I
also bear in mind the limitations of the study: the retrospective
analysis, the omission of radiological images, the absence of universal
classification criteria and relative absence of data in �undetermined cases�
are all issues properly highlighted by the authors in the context of their
analysis.��� 

b.     
Is the court able to make a finding that there was or was not recent
bleeding in the subarachnoid space?

 

145.         
I accept the opinion of Dr Stoodley with regard to the presence
of fresh subarachnoid blood.� This evidence is entirely dependent upon the
interpretation of scans, and the skill and experience of the experts in doing
so.� Paediatric neuroradiology is the pure discipline for reading
such imaging. Dr Stoodley has immense medico-legal experience.� His evidence
was clear and helpful and far from dogmatic.� Dr Stoodley had carried
out a careful forensic analysis of the scans. �Dr Sprigg, a
highly respected paediatric radiologist with extensive neuro imaging experience,
was himself able to concede that Dr Stoodley�s assessment of the images was
more complete than his own had been. �Having had time to reconsider, he
accepts that he missed these small but subtle changes as he concentrated on the
more obvious areas.� I note that Mr Richards does not actually disagree with
this opinion. I find that in so far as he was concerned that there were other,
inconsistent reports, it is understandable that the radiologists reporting in
relation to K�s treatment would not necessarily have been expected to pick this
up.� As Dr Sprigg accepted, and Dr K�ker confirmed, a failure to notice the
more subtle changes in imaging does not necessarily mean that they are not
there.� Nor does it create what was at times in danger of being treated as a �difference�
in radiological opinion. Their evidence in these proceedings is part of the
factual background.� I make the obvious point that any expert opinions to be
taken into account should be from experts properly instructed within the
proceedings and subjected to test and
questioning before the court. 

 

146.   
I find that the bleeding in the sub-arachnoid spaces is more
likely than not the result of trauma.

 

c)������ Is the court able to
make a finding as to the presence or absence of old blood in the subdural fluid
collections?

� 

147.    
�I have considered Dr Stoodley�s comment that all of the imaging
abnormalities are explicable on the basis of a single recent incident, which Dr
Sprigg also included in his first report.� However, this is an area where
radiology cannot resolve the issue, being unable to differentiate absolutely
between an old bleed and a recent traumatic effusion.� I rely on Dr Gatscher�s
evidence which is the most probative evidence on this issue.� Although she
makes a subjective assessment based on what she saw, she is an experienced
neurosurgeon and no doubt skilled at making that judgment.� It directed her
clinical decision to irrigate K�s brain.� I find that it is more likely than
not that K had a chronic subdural haematoma in addition to the acute bleeding.�
The presence of this chronic subdural haematoma is sufficient evidence to make
a further finding that K must have suffered an earlier trauma at least two
weeks prior to 7 April 2013, being the event which cause the chronic subdural
haematoma.

 

d)����� If the court finds
that old blood was present, is the court able to make a finding as to whether
the recent bleeding is a case of re-bleeding?

 

148.    
There is clear evidence both from the radiologists and the neurosurgeons
that the main site of the subdural haematoma and the fluid collection which
required treatment contained acute bleeding. While it is possible that some of
the recent bleeding seen on the scans in that area could be as the result of recent
re-bleeding from a chronic subdural haematoma, and that may also explain K�s
variable presentation over the period prior to 7 April, I accept the evidence that
there are areas of fresh acute blood that are not associated with any chronic
subdural haematomas. This includes areas of acute blood in the posterior fossa
and the spine which Dr Stoodley was able to describe as �unequivocal� in terms
of their presence.� I find that there is fresh blood present in those areas
that is not the result of a re-bleed.� I prefer the radiologists� opinion,
agreed by Dr Ward, that this is likely due to recent trauma.� I have considered
but rejected Mr Richards caution in relation to the origin of this blood,
including that it could be the result of �tracking down�, taking into account
my finding that it is fresh blood, and not the more liquid chronic blood that Mr
Richards referred to as more mobile.� If, as I have found, there has been an
incident of recent trauma sufficient to cause recent bleeding, I find it more
likely than not, that this is the origin of the acute blood seen in the area of
the chronic subdural haematoma, rather than re-bleeding.� This finding is consistent
with Dr Sprigg�s opinion that the amount of acute blood seen is too great to be
explained by a spontaneous re-bleed. 

 

e)������ Is the court able to
determine whether there has been a single incident leading to K�s injuries, or
more than one incident?

 

149.    
The experts are agreed that if fresh blood is present and not from a
re-bleed, then there must have been a separate and recent injury to K, in
addition to an earlier injury that gave rise to the chronic subdural
haematoma.� I find that K has experienced at least two incidents of trauma to
his brain.

 

f)������ Is the court able to
identify the likely timing of an incident or incidents?

�

150.    
There is little doubt that an acute event occurred on the morning of 7th
April morning. I rely on the experts� opinion that the recent injury to K is
likely to have happened shortly before his admission to hospital, and at the
point when the court can say that he was last behaving �neurologically�
normally.� From the evidence of M, but particularly R, this would have been
during the time R was caring for K in the front room, shortly before noon on 7
April 2014.� Before he went floppy, K was happy and playing with a toy and
watching TV, then became whiny but was moving all of his limbs.����� 

 

151.    
The timing of the earlier injury is much more difficult to identify.� There
is no reliable narrative about when such an event might have happened. �It is
not clear that K would have sustained the same level of encephalopathy, or
indeed shown any significant symptoms at the time or following.� The expert
evidence is that this incident is likely to have occurred more than two weeks
before the incident on 7 April.� It is therefore possible that it occurred right
at the beginning of the period when K became unwell, after 21 March.� It may well
predate that period.� K�s symptoms are not inconsistent with a developing
subdural haematoma following the earlier injury, however it is also possible
that they are due to normal childhood infection. �On this evidence it is not
possible for the court to make a clear finding in relation to this issue.

� 

g)����� Does the court accept
the expert opinion as to likely causation of K�s injuries in the light of all
the evidence?

 

152.    
I accept the expert opinion that it is more likely than not that K�s
injuries, including the incidence of encephalopathy, are as a result of his
brain having been shaken, which may or may not have included an element of
impact. I find that although the degree of force required to inflict such
injuries is not quantifiable, it is greater than would be expected during
reasonable handling.� Given his age, a carer should be able to tell the court
about any accident, such as being dropped, that might be relevant.� The only
incident described is the fall on the stairs, which if it happened as
described, the experts do not consider a likely cause.� The absence of other
injuries leads the experts to postulate that this case falls into the lower end
of the spectrum of force.� There were no bruises or grip marks, no skull or rib
fractures, no swelling to the head; no signs of ischaemic or hypoxic damage.� I
find it unlikely that K has been violently attacked.� 

 

153.    
I have considered that it is unfortunate and unusual that K appears to
have suffered two similar injuries to his brain, and while it is certainly
possible that there have been two separate and unrelated incidents, I find it
is far more likely than not that this is a �repeat event� and that both
injuries have been caused by the same action and by the same perpetrator. 

 

154.    
In relation to the earlier incident, it is possible that while it should
be obvious to a carer at the time that their handling was inappropriate, K�s
response may have been such that they did not realise that they had caused significant
harm to the child.� Anyone not witnessing the event would not be expected to be
aware that K had been injured.� In relation to the more recent incident, the
change in K�s functioning would have made that immediately apparent.

� 

155.    
It follows that whatever happened to K, the perpetrator has been
unwilling to admit it and give the court a true and full account.� In the
absence of such an explanation, the court is in difficulty in being able to
reach a conclusion about exactly what happened to K to cause the shaking to his
brain.� There are a number of possibilities considered by the experts,
including shaking, throwing down, or dropping K onto a soft surface.� I am
cautious about accepting at this stage the emerging evidence that a spinal
bleed indicates a shaking mechanism.� It may do, but further research and
testing of this hypothesis is needed.

 

h)����� If the court finds
that the injuries are likely to have been caused by an adult carer, is the
court able to identify the perpetrator

 

156.    
No party is seeking to suggest that any other person could or would be
responsible for K's injuries other than M and R. �

 

157.    
All the evidence suggests that it was R who had the main care of K on
the morning of 7 April and particularly at around the time that I have
identified K suffered the profound change in
his neurological state that I am satisfied was an encephalopathy resulting from
trauma to his brain. �He has been unable to
provide any explanation as to why or how that occurred. 

 

158.    
I am asked to take into account that there is no evidence, anecdotally
from any person of R having ever mistreated or neglected K. �However, I observe
that there will have been limited opportunity for observation of this by anyone
other than M and possibly R�s mother. �

159.     R was, during that period, abstinent his regular use of cannabis which
would likely have affected his concentration, mood and sleep; this in addition
to the increased difficulty they must both have had in caring for K during this
period that I have already referred to.

160.    
I find it significant that there were no concerns about M�s care of K
prior to R becoming involved in their lives.� In contrast to R, there is ample
evidence to support a finding that she was a good and devoted mother, caring
well for K, a child with a particular need for gentle careful handling.� This
is not a child who was hidden from professionals.� M acted entirely appropriately
in relation to her concerns about K during the period between 22 March and 7
April, ensuring that he had medical attention and following the advice given.� ��My
assessment, having heard M give her evidence, is that however economical she
may have been with the truth on other matters, that she would do anything
herself to harm K.� She found it hard to have to consider what might have
happened to K, and could not bring herself to believe that anyone would have harmed
him, which in itself raises concerns that I will come on to.

 

161.    
I find the evidence clear in supporting a finding that it is more likely
than not R who is responsible for the acute injuries sustained by K on 7
April.� In view of my conclusion that it is more likely than not that there is
only one perpetrator of K�s injuries, I am satisfied that I can safely make a finding
that R is responsible for both incidents. �I am satisfied that there is
evidence that he would have had opportunity in relation to an earlier event in
the light of my findings that M has not given a truthful account about the
level of R�s involvement in K�s care, not only during the two weeks preceding 7
April, but also including during the earlier absence of the MGGP�s.� I am
satisfied that there are likely to have been times in both periods when R was
alone and unobserved with K.

� 

162.    
That M is a rather na�ve and trusting individual stands out from the
evidence.� It is clear from her police interview that she was aware of R�s
difficulties and his relationship with his mother.� She knew he used to smoke a
lot of cannabis.� She was present when he attacked his furniture with a knife,
and it is likely she knew that R had self-harmed, he describing her reaction to
it as him being �attention-seeking�.

� 

163.    
I have noted that in her interview she told the police how she does not
judge people on what she is told, but makes up her own mind.� She also said she
likes to �fix� people.� She appears to have felt able to control the situation
in R�s bedroom by shouting at him to stop.� She told the court how different R
was with her and K, he too confirming how much calmer he felt when at M�s
house.� There is also evidence that M is vulnerable in terms of
her own past parenting and experiences, including having been in a relationship
where she experience domestic abuse. 

�

164.    
I find M to have had an over-trusting and over-optimistic approach to R.�
She was insufficiently cautious given what she knew about him. �R seems to have
rapidly been accepted into the group of people that M felt able to trust with
K.� More worrying was her avoidance of implicating R directly herself in these
proceedings, however many times she was invited to follow the logic of her own
position.� She appeared to be unable to or unwilling to draw her own
conclusion, saying � I will accept the Court saying it was him.� I have
to consider why this might be, when she is no longer in a relationship with R,
nor intending to be.� I find it is likely this is through some misplaced sense
of �loyalty� and possibly as a result of how she still feels about R.� This
evidence supports a finding that M failed to protect K.

 

165.    
Finally, turning to consider the threshold criteria under s.31(2)
Children Act 1989, I find that they are met on the basis of the findings, as
recorded in the attached threshold document.

 

166.    
I make these findings having given the matter a great deal
of thought, and I make my findings on the balance of probabilities as I am
required to do.� I reiterate, as I have said several times during this hearing,
that it is an enquiry into what has happened to K, within proceedings brought
to ensure that K�s welfare is met and that he is protected from harm.� No
individual is on trial here, although it is necessary that I make findings
about what people have done, or how I have found them.� For the future,
particularly for R, it is important that I record that I have not found that K
was subject to a deliberate violent attack, and that his injuries are likely to
represent an event towards the lower end of the scale of force used, or trauma
inflicted.� Unfortunately, without a full account of what R did, to go any
further would be speculation.� This court will not need to assess R�s ability
to provide care for a child in future, and while my findings raise issues with
regard to the potential for future risk, they do not in any way represent a
conclusion that R should be ruled out as a future carer of children without
such an assessment being done.� ��

Sir James Munby: 

I have been sitting at Bournemouth in the Bournemouth and Poole County Court hearing a care case. It is a very typical County Court case but, as it happens, it raises a point on which it is desirable that I should give a judgment directed to a wider audience.

 

The background facts 

S, the child with whom I am concerned, was born in October 2013. She is the youngest of her mother's four children. The three older children have all been taken into care. The mother, as is common ground, has a history of street prostitution and drug taking. Her third child was born with drug withdrawal symptoms. 

 

The proceedings in relation to S began in October 2013. An emergency protection order was granted on 21 October 2013, followed by an interim care order on 28 October 2013. The case was transferred to the County Court. It came before His Honour Judge Bond on 14 January 2014 for a further case management hearing. There was a formal application by the local authority for permission to instruct an expert, a psychiatrist, and an informal application by the mother for an assessment in accordance with section 38(6) of the Children Act 1989. Amongst the papers before Judge Bond was a parenting assessment by the local authority dated 20 December 2013, a further report from the local authority dated 6 January 2014, and reports dated 3, 4 and 30 December 2013 from Dr Menzies Schrader, a specialist psychiatrist with the local Mental Health Team who had been treating the mother. Judge Bond directed the filing by 14 February 2014 of a report by a consultant forensic psychiatrist, Dr Jane Ewbank. He adjourned the mother's application pending receipt of Dr Ewbank's report. 

 

The mother's adjourned application came before me on 25 March 2014. By then Dr Ewbank had reported. Her report is dated 18 February 2014. Mr Andy Pitt on behalf of the mother renewed her application for an assessment under section 38(6). As refined before me, the proposal was that I should direct a residential assessment of S and her mother at Orchard House, a Family Assessment and Intervention Centre in Taunton, initially for a weekend and, if that proved successful, for a period of between six and twelve weeks. This residential assessment might then (see below) be followed by a further period of assessment in the community. The application was opposed both by Mr Anthony Hand on behalf of the local authority and by Mr Steven Howard appearing for S's guardian, as well as by Ms Nicola Preston representing S's father. There were reports from Orchard House dated 15 December 2013 and 20 March 2014 setting out what they could offer. There was also a report dated 20 March 2014 from the Dorset Working Women's Project, a sexual health project working with women who sell sex, particularly those who misuse drugs and/or alcohol. 

 

I also had the results of various hair-strand drug tests which the mother had recently undergone. These results were not easy to interpret, though they showed at worst very low levels of drugs in the mother's hair. Mr Pitt did not invite me to hear evidence from the mother, so on this point I cannot come to any conclusion. Nor do I express any views. There is in the event no need for me to do so. I am content for present purposes to proceed on the assumption, though without deciding, that the mother was 'clean' during the periods covered by the tests. 

 

Having reflected on the matter overnight, I informed the parties the following day that I had decided, for reasons which would be given in due course in a written judgment, to refuse the application. It was accordingly dismissed.    

 

The mother's problems 

There are various strands to the mother's problems. For present purposes they can be summarised as follows. The mother is a vulnerable woman who struggles to care for herself. She has mental health problems, an anxiety disorder (exemplified by fears of travelling on public transport and at times elective mutism) with intermittent depressive episodes and borderline low IQ. She has a long history of polysubstance drug misuse and street prostitution. 

 

In relation to this, Mr Howard took me to the notes of the mother's supervised contact sessions with S. Two themes emerge. The first relates to the mother's personal appearance and presentation. There is frequent reference to the mother arriving for contact unkempt, with dirty clothes and smelling of tobacco smoke and unpleasant body odour. She is recorded as being shaky, swaying and shuffling (though apparently not smelling of alcohol). The relevance of this, I assume, is that the mother's inability to look after herself throws light on her ability to look after S. More important are the recordings of the interaction between S and her mother. There is quite frequent reference to the fact that S rarely makes eye contact with her mother but does with the workers, that the mother "has her vacant expression throughout contact" � what on one occasion is described as her "dreamy frozen stare" � and that there is very little interaction between S and her mother. The note of contact on 3 March 2014 comments that S "does not get much stimulation during her contacts." The note of contact the following day records that when her foster carer arrived to collect her, S was "very happy and smiled at the foster carer." The comment is added that "S is a very different child when she is with the foster carer S is a happy laughing child." 

 

The expert evidence 

The local authority's parenting assessment dated 20 December 2013 contains an analysis of which the following are the most significant passages: 

 

"[A report] evidenced some positives in the basic case of S provided by [the mother] during the parenting assessment sessions. [She] has also evidenced a high level of motivation during the assessment, and has engaged to a high level 

[She] has remained stable on her methadone prescription as proven by her hair strand test. This is a positive step forward and indicates a desire and ability to remain clean even at times of stress such as current proceedings 

... 

The child protection risks are of concern and there are still considerable risks potentially posed to S. 

However [the mother] has showed some positive insight into parenting and has showed potential for further growth and change. 

[Her] mental health difficulties are complex and difficult to understand and I feel we require in depth support from her mental health professionals, to ascertain if there is further support that could be provided with regards to her mental health that may improve [her] position as good parent. 

There is a possibility that a short term mother and baby placement tailored to [her] additional needs may be appropriate dependent on other professionals reports and professional opinions. This would be to further determine if she can parent in the whole when responsible for her child, or whether or not, she can merely manage basic parenting in a controlled environment such as FRC for 1� hours. 

It should be noted that since completion of the report, I have had access to case recordings from recent contacts from the start of December and there has been deterioration in [her] parenting skills and presentation. 

There have been concerns raised by the contact worker regarding her physical support of S, her hygiene and nappy changing. It is unclear why this change in [her] skills has changed. 

[She] has also expressed to contact workers she is experiencing panic attacks and cannot cope with the short journey by taxi to FRC. This contradicts the information she provided to me, and is concerning she is mentioning this now the assessment is complete. 

The fundamental concern this raises is that since completion of the parenting assessment, [she] has been unable to sustain the level of parenting she previously was providing S. This could be due to instability in her mental health or an inability to maintain good level of parenting. 

S requires a safe, nurturing and consistent upbringing to ensure she has the best possible opportunity for a health and happy life. 

If [the mother] is unable to provide this in the confines of the FRC, it is questionable whether or not she could long term."

The further report dated 6 January 2014, which records a visit to the mother's home on 4 December 2013, contains this comment: "It was very evident during my visit that [the mother] is fully dependent on her sister � to fulfil her day to day needs which concerns me in respect of [her] ability to parent S independently." 

 

The mother's key worker at the Dorset Working Women's Project describes working with the mother from 2001 until 2008, when "she appeared to have settled down and was stable." She next saw the mother in December 2012, describing her then as being "clearly mentally unwell and extremely vulnerable." She continues: 

 

"[She] appeared to be making progress until she was befriended by a known perpetrator who has a history of violence and abuse towards vulnerable women � Unfortunately once the relationship began [he] had complete control over [her] � and she appeared to be working more."

That man is S's father. He has been in prison again since July 2013. Of the mother's subsequent re-engagement with the Project and more recent presentation the key worker says that the mother's presentation has "improved greatly" and that she "continues to make good progress".   

Dr Schrader was supportive of a residential assessment to assess the mother's parenting abilities. In his report dated 30 December 2013 he said that "Her presentation currently is vastly improved from how she presented in 2012 and in January of this year and I believe is primarily as she is having input and been abstinent from substances. This is the first time she has engaged to this extent". On the other hand, he noted that she "continues to have difficulties with anxiety" and described her as "a complex lady who desperately would like to raise her daughter, but who has numerous issues which could impede this process." He added, "Improvement in these areas of difficulty is going to take time." 

 

Dr Ewbank accepted that the mother "appears to be demonstrating an increased capacity to engage in treatment with both the drug services and the CMHT". Commenting that "Historically she has been a very poor engager, missing multiple mental health appointments and repeatedly disengaging from drugs services either by not attending or by using illicit drugs on top of her Methadone prescription," Dr Ewbank continued, "There does appear to be evidence over recent months of sustained engagement with both services and she has clearly benefited from the support of � the Dorset Working Women's Project." Asked to indicate the prognosis for change, Dr Ewbank said: 

 

"Given [her] long standing drug problems, dating back almost 20 years, it is likely that achieving and sustaining first stability and subsequently abstinence from illicit drugs may take some time and is likely to require on-going treatment and support for many years."

She added, "there is still a very real risk that she may resort to buying other medication to help her sleep � and thus exacerbate her problems again."  

Orchard House 

Having reviewed the papers in the case, Dr Freda Gardner, a consultant clinical psychologist and the clinical director of Orchard House, expressed the view in her report dated 15 December 2013 that a residential assessment was appropriate and indicated. She described the regime: 

 

"The high level of monitoring, 24-hours a day, afforded by a residential assessment would allow a thorough assessment of parenting to be undertaken whilst concurrently ensuring the safeguarding of S. This would include [the mother's] parenting ability, and capacity for further change, and a consistent period of assessment regarding her current drug use."

She continued: 

"During assessment at Orchard House [she] would be provided with a tailored package of support and intervention to develop her capacity / potential capacity to meet the full range of S's needs, including 'Keep Safe' work around prostitution, appropriate adults, and ongoing drug use. 

The Social Work led Assessment Team and the Family Support Workers at Orchard House are highly experienced in working with a wide range of parents, and benefit from full integration of Clinical Psychologists experienced in a wide range of clinical presentations including personality disorder presentations and selective mutism. The staff support parents in developing skills and provide immediate verbal feedback, as well as written / pictorial feedback to improve parenting skills, which are based on research evidence. All staff at Orchard House aim to ensure that each family receives appropriate and consistent information The staff use a variety of techniques and specialist materials designed to help parents learn new skills, which may include formal instruction, modeling, breaking tasks down into small chunks, and giving lots of opportunities for rehearsal and repetition. 

� 

I am aware that any assessment will need to be within S's timescales, and would therefore recommend that the residential assessment be kept as brief as possible, with regular reviews held to ensure the progression of the assessment. Typically, residential assessments are 6-12 weeks in length, though this depends on the specific needs of the family and the key issues of the assessment. Following a successful period of residential assessment, it may be appropriate for the assessment to move to the community or to the Orchard House community base. Orchard House are able and willing to provide carefully considered plans for transition."

In her further report dated 20 March 2014 Dr Gardner confirmed her opinion that Dr Ewbank's report did not change her view. Section 38(6) � the legal framework 

 

Section 38(6) of the Children Act 1989 provides so far as material that: "Where the court makes an interim care order ... , it may give such directions (if any) as it considers appropriate with regard to the medical or psychiatric examination or other assessment of the child �" 

 

The meaning of this provision is authoritatively explained by the House of Lords in two cases: In re C (A Minor) (Interim Care Order: Residential Assessment) [1997] AC 489, [1997] 1 FLR 1, and In re G (A Minor) (Interim Care Order: Residential Assessment) [2005] UKHL 68, [2006] 1 AC 576, [2006] 1 FLR 601. It suffices for present purposes to cite two brief passages from the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond in In re G. In the first (para 69) she said: 

 

"In short, what is directed under section 38(6) must clearly be an examination or assessment of the child, including where appropriate her relationship with her parents, the risk that her parents may present to her, and the ways in which those risks may be avoided or managed, all with a view to enabling the court to make the decisions which it has to make under the Act with the minimum of delay. Any services which are provided for the child and his family must be ancillary to that end. They must not be an end in themselves."

Referring to the Protocol for Judicial Case Management in Public Law Children Act Cases [2003] 2 FLR 719, the precursor to the revised Public Law Outline (PLO), due to come into force in its final form later this month, she added (para 71): 

"if the aims of the protocol are to be realised, it will always be necessary to think early and clearly about what assessments are indeed necessary to decide the case. In many cases, the local authority should be able to make its own core assessment and the child's guardian to make an independent assessment in the interests of the child. Further or other assessments should only be commissioned if they can bring something important to the case which neither the local authority nor the guardian is able to bring."

I draw attention to Lady Hale's use of the word "necessary". 

Two other authorities cited to me require brief mention. In Re J (Residential Assessment: Rights of Audience) [2009] EWCA Civ 1210, [2010] 1 FLR 1290, para 10, Wall LJ, as he then was, said: 

 

"I think it important to remember when one is looking either at the independent assessments by social workers or at applications under section 38(6) of the Act that one needs to be child focused. It is not a question of the mother's right to have a further assessment, it is: would the assessment assist the judge in reaching a conclusion or the right conclusion in relation to the child in question?"

Referring to this in Re T (Residential Parenting Assessment) [2011] EWCA Civ 812, [2012] 2 FLR 308, para 93, Black LJ rejected the proposition that "a parent facing the permanent removal of their child has a right in all cases to an assessment of their choice rather than one carried out or commissioned by the local authority." She continued: 

"Still less is there a principle such as that for which [counsel] contends, namely that parents must be given the chance to put forward a positive case to the judge determining the issue of whether a care order should be made'."

Sir Nicholas Wall P, para 53, identified the "critical questions" as being: 

"(1) does this child's welfare warrant an assessment under section 38(6) of the Act? And (2) in looking at the timetable for the child, is there evidence that this mother will be able to care adequately for the child within the child's timetable?"

Later this month, the amendments to section 38 of the 1989 Act effected by the Children and Families Act 2014 will be brought into force. Sections 38(7A) and (7B), inserted by section 13(11) of the 2014 Act, provide as follows: 

 

"(7A) A direction under subsection (6) to the effect that there is to be a medical or psychiatric examination or other assessment of the child may be given only if the court is of the opinion that the examination or other assessment is necessary to assist the court to resolve the proceedings justly. 

(7B) When deciding whether to give a direction under subsection (6) to that effect the court is to have regard in particular to � 

(a) any impact which any examination or other assessment would be likely to have on the welfare of the child, and any other impact which giving the direction would be likely to have on the welfare of the child, 

(b) the issues with which the examination or other assessment would assist the court, 

(c) the questions which the examination or other assessment would enable the court to answer, 

(d) the evidence otherwise available, 

(e) the impact which the direction would be likely to have on the timetable, duration and conduct of the proceedings, 

(f) the cost of the examination or other assessment, and 

(g) any matters prescribed by Family Procedure Rules." 



The language of section 38(7A) replicates, in all material respects verbatim, the more general provision in section 13(6) of the 2014 Act which applies to the calling of expert evidence (and which in turn replicates, with the addition of the word "justly", the language of FPR 25.1). Likewise, the language of section 38(7B) is very similar to that of section 13(7) of the 2014 Act. 

 

For present purposes the key point is the use in common in section 38(7A) of the 1989 Act, section 13(6) of the 2014 Act and FPR 25.1 of the qualifying requirement that the court may direct the assessment or expert evidence only if it is "necessary" to assist the court to resolve the proceedings. This phrase must have the same meaning in both contexts. The addition of the word "justly" only makes explicit what was necessarily implicit, for it goes without saying that any court must always act justly rather than unjustly. So "necessary" in section 38(7A) has the same meaning as the same word in section 13(6), as to which see Re TG (Care Proceedings: Case Management: Expert Evidence) [2013] EWCA Civ 5, [2013] 1 FLR 1250, para 30, and In re H-L (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Expert Evidence) [2013] EWCA Civ 655, [2014] 1 WLR 1160, [2013] 2 FLR 1434, para 3. 

 

The wider context 

By the time the case came before me on 25 March 2014, the proceedings had already been on foot for a little over five months. What was being proposed by Orchard House envisaged a process that might extend the proceedings well beyond six months, indeed possibly for as long as eight months or even longer. This requires consideration of the principle set out in the interim PLO � which applies to this case � and shortly to be reinforced by section 14 of the 2014 Act. 

 

Section 14 of the 2014 Act amends section 32 of the Children Act 1989 so that from later this month section 32 will in material part read as follows: 

 

"(1) A court hearing an application for an order under this Part shall � 

(a) draw up a timetable with a view to disposing of the application � 

(i) without delay, and 

(ii) in any event within twenty-six weeks beginning with the day on which the application was issued; and 

(b) give such directions as it considers appropriate for the purpose of ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, that that timetable is adhered to. � 

(5) A court in which an application under this Part is proceeding may extend the period that is for the time being allowed under subsection (1)(a)(ii) in the case of the application, but may do so only if the court considers that the extension is necessary to enable the court to resolve the proceedings justly. 

(6) When deciding whether to grant an extension under subsection (5), a court must in particular have regard to �  

(a) the impact which any ensuing timetable revision would have on the welfare of the child to whom the application relates, and 

(b) the impact which any ensuing timetable revision would have on the duration and conduct of the proceedings; and here "ensuing timetable revision" means any revision, of the timetable under subsection (1)(a) for the proceedings, which the court considers may ensue from the extension. 

(7) When deciding whether to grant an extension under subsection (5), a court is to take account of the following guidance: extensions are not to be granted routinely and are to be seen as requiring specific justification. � 

(10) Rules of court may provide that a court �  

(a) when deciding whether to exercise the power under subsection (5), or 

(b) when deciding how to exercise that power, 

must, or may or may not, have regard to matters specified in the rules, or must take account of any guidance set out in the rules."

No rules have been made pursuant to section 32(10) and none are proposed to be made for the time being. 

Section 32(1)(a)(ii) does not describe some mere aspiration or target, nor does it prescribe an average. It defines, subject only to the qualification in section 32(5) and compliance with the requirements of sections 32(6) and (7), a mandatory limit which applies to all cases. It follows that there will be many cases that can, and therefore should, be concluded well within the 26 week limit. I repeat what I said in my first 'View from the President's Chambers: The process of reform', [2013] Fam Law 548: "My message is clear and uncompromising: this deadline can be met, it must be met, it will be met. And remember, 26 weeks is a deadline, not a target; it is a maximum, not an average or a mean. So many cases will need to be finished in less than 26 weeks." 

 

What then of the qualification in section 32(5)? 

 

In In re B-S (Children) (Adoption Order: Leave to Oppose) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, [2014] 1 WLR 563, paras 32-46, the Court of Appeal spelt out the essentials which the law and good practice demand in all cases when the court is being asked to approve a care plan for adoption or being asked to make a non-consensual placement order or adoption order. Giving the judgment of the court, I said this (para 49): 

 

"We do not envisage that proper compliance with what we are demanding, which may well impose a more onerous burden on practitioners and judges, will conflict with the requirement, soon to be imposed by statute, that care cases are to be concluded within a maximum of 26 weeks. Critical to the success of the reforms is robust judicial case management from the outset of every care case. Case management judges must be astute to ensure that the directions they give are apt to the task and also to ensure that their directions are complied with. Never is this more important than in cases where the local authority's plan envisages adoption."

I continued: 

"If, despite all, the court does not have the kind of evidence we have identified, and is therefore not properly equipped to decide these issues, then an adjournment must be directed, even if this takes the case over 26 weeks. Where the proposal before the court is for non-consensual adoption, the issues are too grave, the stakes for all are too high, for the outcome to be determined by rigorous adherence to an inflexible timetable and justice thereby potentially denied."

That approach, which is entirely compatible with the requirements of section 32, applies not just in the particular context under consideration in In re B-S but more generally. 

 

In my seventh 'View', [2013] Fam Law 1394, I described the remarkable work being done by the Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC) under the inspirational leadership of District Judge (Magistrates' Court) Nicholas Crichton. I touched on the question of how the FDAC model was to meet the challenge of the 26 week time limit and fit with the PLO. I said: 

 

" � we must see how best the PLO can accommodate the FDAC model (I put it this way, rather than the other way round). We must always remember that the PLO is a means of achieving justice and the best outcomes for children and, wherever possible, their families. It is not, and must never be allowed to become, a straightjacket, least of all if rigorous adherence to an inflexible timetable risks putting justice in jeopardy."

More recently, in Re NL (A child) (Appeal: Interim Care Order: Facts and Reasons) [2014] EWHC 270 (Fam), para 40, Pauffley J has expressed the point in words which I cannot improve upon and which I wholeheartedly endorse: "Justice must never be sacrificed upon the altar of speed." 

 

So despite the imperative demand of section 32(1)(a)(ii), there can be exceptions. But before going further it is vital to recall the equally imperative language of sections 32(5) and 32(7). An extension beyond 26 weeks is to be permitted only if it is "necessary to enable the court to resolve the proceedings justly". This is precisely the same language as appears in section 38(7A) of the 1989 Act and section 13(6) of the 2014 Act, so it must mean the same. Specifically, the learning in Re TG and in In re H-L must, in my judgment, apply as much to section 32(5) of the 1989 Act as it does to section 38(7A) of the 1989 Act and section 13(6) of the 2014 Act. Moreover, extensions are "not to be granted routinely" and require "specific justification." 

 

In what circumstances may the qualification in section 32(5) apply? 

 

This is not the occasion for any elaborate discussion of a question which, in the final analysis, can be determined only on a case by case basis. But some preliminary and necessarily tentative observations are appropriate.  

 

There will, as it seems to me, be three different forensic contexts in which an extension of the 26 week time limit in accordance with section 32(5) may be "necessary": 

 

i) The first is where the case can be identified from the outset, or at least very early on, as one which it may not be possible to resolve justly within 26 weeks. Experience will no doubt identify the kind of cases that may fall within this category. Four examples which readily spring to mind (no doubt others will emerge) are (a) very heavy cases involving the most complex medical evidence where a separate fact finding hearing is directed in accordance with Re S (Split Hearing) [2014] EWCA Civ 25, [2014] 2 FLR (forthcoming), para 29, (b) FDAC type cases (see further below), (c) cases with an international element where investigations or assessments have to be carried out abroad and (d) cases where the parent's disabilities require recourse to special assessments or measures (as to which see Re C (A Child) [2014] EWCA Civ 128, para 34). 

ii) The second is where, despite appropriately robust and vigorous judicial case management, something unexpectedly emerges to change the nature of the proceedings too late in the day to enable the case to be concluded justly within 26 weeks. Examples which come to mind are (a) cases proceeding on allegations of neglect or emotional harm where allegations of sexual abuse subsequently surface, (b) cases which are unexpectedly 'derailed' because of the death, serious illness or imprisonment of the proposed carer, and (c) cases where a realistic alternative family carer emerges late in the day. 

iii) The third is where litigation failure on the part of one or more of the parties makes it impossible to complete the case justly within 26 weeks (the type of situation addressed in In re B-S, para 49). 

I repeat, because the point is so important, that in no case can an extension beyond 26 weeks be authorised unless it is "necessary" to enable the court to resolve the proceedings "justly". Only the imperative demands of justice � fair process � or of the child's welfare will suffice. 

 

I referred above to FDAC type cases. I have in mind cases of the type that might benefit from what I will call the FDAC approach. The approach (see the description in my seventh View, [2013] Fam Law 1394) is based on problem solving by a specialist, multi-disciplinary team supporting the parents in overcoming their problems where children have been put at risk, for example by parental substance misuse. The aim is to help to keep the family together, where possible. The team formulates an intervention plan to test whether the parents can overcome their problems and meet their child's needs within the child's timescale. Expectations are clear. The progress made by the parents is monitored regularly. If the parents cannot maintain the necessary progress the process is brought to an end. 

 

Originally, the FDAC approach was pioneered in the FDAC court created by DJ(MC) Crichton at Wells Street in London. Another FDAC is now running at Gloucester and others are planned elsewhere. But the FDAC approach does not necessarily require a FDAC. Similar principles are being applied, for example, in Plymouth, pre-proceedings in a community based model pioneered by Bath and North East Somerset Council, in Liverpool by the use of a pre-proceedings protocol and in a small number of specialist domestic abuse survivors' projects. No doubt other models will emerge. Typically, a multi-disciplinary team approach is agreed with the designated family judge or judge in charge of the specialist court, so that the support network and assessment team are available and funded in accordance with an agreed model. Decisions in principle about the capability of the parents to care for their child are usually made within 26 weeks, leaving such longer implementation as may be within the child's timescale to be achieved within an extended timetable for the proceedings. 

 

The FDAC approach is crucially important. The simple reality is that FDAC works. DJ(MC) Crichton has shown what can be achieved for children and their parents even in the most unpromising circumstances. FDAC is, it must be, a vital component in the new Family Court. 

 

Viewed from a judicial perspective a vital component of the FDAC approach has to be a robust and realistic appraisal at the outset of what is possible within the child's timescale and an equally robust and realistic ongoing appraisal throughout of whether what is needed is indeed being achieved (or not) within the child's timescale. These appraisals must be evidence based, with a solid foundation, not driven by sentiment or a hope that 'something may turn up'. Typically three questions will have to be addressed. First, is there some solid, evidence based, reason to believe that the parent is committed to making the necessary changes? If so, secondly, is there some solid, evidence based, reason to believe that the parent will be able to maintain that commitment? If so, thirdly, is there some solid, evidence based, reason to believe that the parent will be able to make the necessary changes within the child's timescale? 

 

Discussion 

On behalf of the mother, Mr Pitt submits that she has complied with everything asked of her, is no longer taking drugs, has made progress in relation to her mental health � she is now talking freely � and continues to engage with the agencies and professionals who are in place to support and assist her.  

 

Mr Hand on behalf of the local authority accepts that, to her credit, the mother has been making improvements. But, he submits, she has a long way to go. There is, he says, no realistic way in which she could care, or be supported long term to care, for S. Given the range of expert material already before the court, further assessment will not, he submits, assist the court in discharging its responsibilities. The combined effect of all the material is, he says, that the mother will not be able to care for S long term. Moreover, given the poor quality of the mother's contact with S he questions whether it is compatible with S's welfare to expose her to a residential assessment with the mother in the absence of it having a good chance of success. On top of all that, he questions whether the inevitable delay can be justified unless there is a good chance of success.  

 

Mr Howard, for S, makes much the same points as Mr Hand. While the mother has made improvements they are insufficient and too late to indicate that she would be able to care for S within the child's timescale. The assessment is not necessary. The guardian, moreover, is particularly concerned about the impact on S of the proposed assessment. The mother's parenting of S during the assessment could undermine the secure attachment S currently has. Given the extensive assessments already undertaken, the mother's poor prospects of success do not justify the "experiment" she is proposing, nor is it within the child's timescale.   

 

After careful reflection I concluded that Mr Hand and Mr Howard were right, and essentially for the reasons they gave. I can summarise my conclusions quite shortly.  

 

In the first place I agree with them that the proposed assessment is not necessary, either in the sense described by Lady Hale in In re G or in the sense (the same sense) in which the word is used in FPR 25.1 and in section 38(7A) of the 1989 Act. There are two aspects to this. Further assessment is not going to add significantly to what the court already knows. Moreover, the kind of assessment proposed by Orchard House, although it may tell us something about the mother's ability to parent S in a practical sense (though nothing important we do not already know) is not going to be able to tell us very much about the mother's ability to address her many other difficulties, let alone her ability to sustain in the long term in the community whatever improvements may be noted in the short term in the supportive and controlled environment of Orchard House. 

 

Secondly, there is no adequate justification, let alone the necessity which section 32(5) of the 1989 Act will shortly require, for an extension of the case so significantly beyond 26 weeks. Again, there are two aspects to this. Looking to the mother, there is, sadly, at present no solid, evidence based, reason to believe that she will be able to make the necessary changes within S's timescale. Even assuming that there is some solid, evidence based, reason to believe that she is committed to making the necessary changes, there is, sadly, not enough reason to believe that she will be able to maintain that commitment. In the light of her history, and all the evidence to hand, the assertion that she will seems to me to be founded more on hope than solid expectation, just as does any assertion that she will be able to make the necessary changes within S's timescale. Secondly, I have to have regard to the detrimental effects on S of further delay. Far from this being a case where the child's welfare demands an extension of the 26 weeks time limit, S's needs point if anything in the other direction. I accept the guardian's analysis.

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with A, who was born on 29th�March 2005 so is now just 9.  A was the eldest of a sibling group of four children who became the subject of care and placement orders on 21st�January 2011.  

 
The mother of all the children is B and the father of A, and of his sister C, is D.  A's Cafcass guardian is E. 

 
This is the Local Authority's application to revoke the placement order in relation to A, which is supported by the father and A's guardian.  I have dealt with it on the basis of the parties' submissions. 

 
The father has taken the trouble to attend this and previous hearings. The mother is not present in court.   The Local Authority has gone to considerable lengths to try to trace her and, indeed, D has also done what he can to assist.  It seems that the address that the Local Authority did once have is no longer occupied or capable of being occupied.  The maternal grandmother has been contacted.  She has no address for the mother.  The telephone number she has provided "rings out" and attempts by a process server to find B have been unsuccessful.  Given her lack of involvement in A's life in recent years and  given that the order which I am asked to revoke was one which she stoutly opposed in 2011, I am satisfied that it is right to proceed in her absence on the basis that she currently simply cannot be found.  

 
The evidence was clear at the time when I granted the placement order that it would not be easy to find an adoptive placement for A and, indeed, that has proved to be the case.  His younger siblings have all been placed together for adoption. I was very concerned about the plan to separate A and C but was ultimately persuaded that that was the right way forward for each of them individually. A has remained with foster carers who are approved to care for him long term.

 
Happily, over the last three years, life has actually gone extremely well for A.  He is very settled and happy with his foster carers, seeing himself as an integral part of that family.  The guardian describes him as "a delightful, inquisitive and active little boy".  This is undoubtedly where A wants to stay and where he is flourishing.  He is doing well at school despite his initial difficulties.  He enjoys sport and he is making good progress in all areas of his development.

 
It is particularly fortunate that A is able to have contact with his younger siblings, maintained by their adopters and his foster carers. So, for instance, the children go to each other's birthday parties and exchange gifts at Christmas and Easter.  

 
The mother has had two children since the conclusion of the proceedings in January 2011.  By that stage, she was living within a different Local Authority.  Those children have, sadly, also had to be placed for adoption.  It is unfortunate that direct contact between those two children and A and his three siblings has not yet been instituted.  A's guardian, E, was also the guardian for those two children.  She has spoken to their adopters, who are perfectly willing to facilitate direct and indirect contact. That is a matter that really does need to be resolved urgently.   

 
The other issue which must be sorted out is a life storybook for A.  He has some understanding of why he is where he is and appears to be very emotionally secure in that understanding.  However, he does still need a life storybook.  

 
That issue is linked with the question of indirect contact with D. There has been no indirect or direct contact over the last few years between A and his father.  Indirect contact needs to be introduced in a careful and sensitive fashion in line with A's understanding, as it develops, of his current status.  It is unfortunate that D has placed pictures of the children on Facebook.  I accept his explanation that he did not understand that he was thereby doing anything wrong and his assurance that it will not happen in the future.

 
Taking all of those matters into account, bearing in mind A's welfare throughout his life, and applying the welfare checklist at section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 I am satisfied that it no longer accords with A's welfare to remain the subject of a placement order and I formally revoke the placement order that I granted on 21st�January 2011. I approve the Local Authority plan that A should remain with his current carers under the auspices of the existing care order to the Local Authority. I will reserve any further applications in relation to A to myself and I will make the usual orders in relation to the costs of this application.

 
I am conscious that A's siblings have all been to court for an "adoption ceremony".  If A and his carers would like to come to visit court to mark his new status, they would be most welcome. No doubt arrangements can be made via the key social worker.

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with a little boy called A, who was born on 10th�January 2009, so he is now 5.  His mother is B and his father C.  

 
The other individuals concerned in these proceedings are his maternal grandmother, D; the Local Authority's key social worker, E; and A's guardian, who is F.

 
On 23rd�February 2011, His Honour Judge Knopf, sitting in this court, made a care order in relation to A and his half-sibling H.  He approved the Local Authority's care plan, which provided for direct contact on two occasions per year between A and his father for identity purposes.  The plan was for A and H to live with the maternal grandmother, although their mother remained closely involved in their lives.

 
The mother has the misfortune to suffer from bipolar disorder.  As a result of C's behaviour towards her, she now also suffers from post traumatic stress disorder.  The culmination of a deeply abusive relationship was an assault by C committed upon B on 8th�January 2010 followed by a further battery on 12th�January 2010 (recorded as item 9 in his extensive criminal record).  C was sentenced to three and a half years' imprisonment, a sentence which reflects the gravity of the assault.

 
The first application in time is the Local Authority's application to discharge the care order issued on 2nd�September 2013.  That was an application which encompassed both A and H.  Both children have now returned to the day-to-day care of their mother, although their grandmother is still very closely involved.  On 3rd�January 2014, in relation to H, I agreed to discharge the care order and made a joint residence order in favour of the mother and the maternal grandmother.  K, the mother's older son has now also returned to live at home. It is very pleasing indeed to record the very real progress which the mother has made. There is no opposition to the discharge of the care order in relation to A and I intend to make a joint residence order.  

 
However, the issue of the Local Authority's application for discharge of the care order prompted an application by C for contact to A, issued in January 2014. The father does not seek direct contact immediately.  He suggests there should be a period of indirect contact so that he can be reintroduced into his son's life.  That suggestion is stoutly opposed by the other parties to these proceedings.

 
Following his discharge from prison, C exercised contact with A on three occasions in accordance with the Local Authority's care plan.  The last contact visit took place in October 2012. Since then, A has become very unhappy about the prospect of any contact with his father and the Local Authority ceased to facilitate it. 

 
The matter came back before His Honour Judge Knopf.  During the course of the hearing, the father absented himself from the courtroom and His Honour Judge Knopf declined to make any further order in relation to direct or indirect contact.

 
Given the mother's acute vulnerability, I have excused her presence during these hearings, though she has been represented.  The father has attended on two occasions.  On the last occasion and again today, he has absented himself during the course of the proceedings.  Today, he put forward an excuse which I have some difficulty in accepting but which, even put at its highest, did not justify him leaving a crucial final hearing in relation to his son.  

 
Accordingly, I have dealt with the matter on the basis of the two statements the father has filed in support of his application; the core assessment, which was prepared by J, social worker, as long ago as December 2012 and her initial statement on 23rd�August 2013; and, more importantly, the evidence of E filed as recently as 25th�March 2014.  I also have the advantage of a detailed Cafcass report from F, dated 2nd�April 2014. 

 
The father has participated, albeit superficially, in an assessment by E, not seeing fit to attend all of the agreed appointments.  I am satisfied that the father underwent some courses while in prison and, since his discharge from custody, he has completed an IDAP course.  He tells me through his counsel that he has changed and he is not the same man he once was.  

 
On the other hand, there are four separate recent FWIN reports from Police Force O, setting out incidents to which the police have been called occurring between C and a lady called L, who is described as his "former partner" and the mother of his child.  C has also explained to the guardian's solicitor that there was further involvement from the police in August 2013, an occasion upon which his then partner appears to have suffered significant injury, although C denies having inflicted violence upon her.

 
In reaching my conclusions, I have borne firmly in mind both section 34 of the Children Act 1989 and the Local Authority's obligation to facilitate reasonable contact between a child and his parents but, more pertinently for the future, section 1(3) of the Children Act.  A's welfare must be my paramount concern and I have referred myself to the welfare checklist. It is a drastic step to deprive any child of a meaningful relationship with his father.  I also bear in mind A and his father's Article 8 right to respect for their family life.  Any interference with those rights must be lawful, necessary and justified by pressing concern for A's welfare.  I attach very limited weight to A's wishes and feelings given his age, although he has expressed himself very clearly to the guardian as not wanting to see his father.  More important is the likely impact upon the mother of any resumption of direct contact.  C may contend that he has changed.  I think B would take a great deal of persuading of that proposition and it is quite clear from her CPN that the continuance of direct contact after C's discharge from custody has had a very serious impact upon her and I quote from C11:

 
"It has been significantly evident during the course of the assessment that the continued prevalence of her ex-partner's contact with [A] has been a precipitating factor in [B's] being unwell.  When [B] has had periods where her mental health has deteriorated, it has been linked with the timing of contact arrangements between [A] and his father and [B] has expressed how the continued prevalence of him in her life has made it very difficult to put the trauma that she has suffered behind her as this has been a constant trigger."
A has picked up, no doubt, on his mother's anxiety and that of his siblings and his reason for not wanting to see his father is because, "He used to hit mummy."  
It would be utterly disastrous for this little boy and, indeed, his siblings, if his mother's fragile mental health were to be affected by contact arrangements.  This is a family that is now reunited and making good progress.  The children are flourishing.  The mother is in a stable condition.  I would not wish to do anything to jeopardise that.  I remain sceptical, given the existence of the FWINs, that C has indeed made the progress that he contends but even taking his case at its highest, in my judgment, B remains absolutely terrified of him.

 
In all of those circumstances and applying the welfare checklist, I am satisfied that it could not conceivably accord with the welfare of this little boy for me to begin the process of reintroducing him to his father.  Their relationship is tenuous in the extreme.  He went to prison when A was, I think, 13 months and has had three contact visits since then.  I do think it would potentially be helpful for A to have information about his father and for his father to have some indirect contact with him.  That is a possibility that has been open to the father now for a very long period of time and he has not availed himself of it but, even so, I think it would be in A's interests for there to be some very limited indirect contact, perhaps on two occasions each year, neutral occasions, not birthdays and Christmas, for him to be able to communicate with his son in some way.  It seems that the most sensible way of trying to achieve that would be via some form of email to an email address set up specifically for this purpose.  I am not sure how that can be negotiated in the absence of the involvement of the Local Authority, so whilst I am content to discharge the care order and I do so, that is on the basis that, over the coming weeks, Ms N, the current key social worker will do her best to facilitate those indirect contact arrangements before the case is closed.

 
I will make a residence order to the mother and the maternal grandmother.  I make no order for direct contact.  I reserve any further applications in relation to A to myself.  I direct a transcript of this short and imperfect judgment and I direct the usual assessment of the legally assisted parties' costs.

JUDGE JOHN MITCHELL:�� 

 

1                  
I have to make a
very important decision about a baby boy called B.� His mother (whom
I shall call �M�) is 18 years old and his father (whom I shall call
�F�) is 23 years old.� They have another son, A, who was born in
February 2013.� In August 2013, I made an order placing A in the care
of the local authority and gave permission for them to place him with someone
who could adopt him.� At that time M was pregnant with B.� It had taken a whole
year before the final decision could be taken about A.� He remains with his
foster carers because proposed adopters are still being identified and approved
to be his adopters.

 

2                  
B was born in
December 2013 and now is still� only 16 weeks old. Since a few days after he
was born B has been living with foster carers who are also A�s foster carers. M
and F see B four times a week for two hours at a contact centre.� 

 

3                  
I have seven
issues to decide: 

 

�������� 1�� Is� the
threshold test set by s.31 of the Children Act 1989� satisfied? �I can
only make a care order, I can only give permission for B to be placed for
adoption, if I am satisfied that at the time the proceedings were started,
and that was when he was only a few days old, he was suffering, or is likely to
suffer, harm as a result of the care he was receiving, or was likely to
receive, not being what it would be reasonable for his parents to give him.� If
I decide that that test is not satisfied, the proceedings end here.�
However, if they are satisfied I can consider what order I should
make.

2      
Should I adjourn
the case so that B�s parents can be assessed for their suitability to go with B
for a residential assessment lasting some months?

3      
��Should B live
with his parents?

4      
��If not, should
I place him in the care of the local authority?

5      
I place B in
the care of the local authority should I give them permission to place him
for adoption?� Their hope and intention is that he should be placed with his
brother, A, with the same prospective adopter who has been found.

6      
��If
I decide that it is in B�s interests to be placed for adoption, can and
should I dispense with the consent of his parents to his being placed on
the ground that his welfare requires it?

7      
What order, if
any, should I make for contact between B and his parents until he is
placed for adoption? By law I cannot at this stage to make any order
allowing them to have contact with him after an adoption order is made.

B�s Mother

 

8                  
M is eighteen
years old.� She had a very difficult and troubled early life.� Her own mother
was very young and she had been known to this local authority when she was a
child.� After her birth M went straight from hospital to foster carers.� She
moved to live with her mother who were struggling with alcohol dependency and
drug use.� However, that was not a success and eventually she went to live with
her father.� 

 

9                  
Later in her
life, M was placed in the care of the London Borough of Haringey.� She went to live
with foster carers but that too did not succeed and she moved from her first
carers to a number of other carers.� It is not surprising that she faced a
number of serious personal difficulties. Her life was very unhappy.� By 2011
she was again �living with her father but her chaotic lifestyle continued.� 

 

10             
During the
proceedings relating to A, a report was commissioned from a consultant child
and adolescent psychiatrist,�� In her report the psychiatrist explained what are
called �attachment behaviours� which �develop in infancy between a child and
those who are caring for him or her..� Attachment strategies effect our future �relationships.�
The psychiatrist �thought that M had quite complex strategies.� She
consistently complained that the person she was in a relationship with was
getting it wrong.� At times she would be very aggressive, probably because of
her fear of what might happen to her.� She idealised her father and the
psychiatrist thought it was likely that she had learnt to put his needs first.�
Her relationship with her mother was a very complex one. Sadly her mother died
on the day A was born.

 

11             
The Child and
Adolescent psychiatrist��� thought there was the risk that M would start
over-controlling and manipulating F.� At the final hearing into� A�s future , M
said this to me:

 

�I have grown up in care and it has
been very hard.� I was placed with a family for seven years, the son
abused me and I was deeply unhappy.� I didn�t have anyone to talk to,
I didn�t tell anyone how I felt.� Instead, I kept everything
bottled up inside me.� I had to go through these experiences totally on my
own and I felt abandoned and isolated.� I was consequently placed in
children�s homes.� I was only allowed to see my parents nine times a year
and I really missed them.� 

 

I lashed out at people who tried to
help me because I felt they didn�t understand me or the hurt I was
feeling.� I ran away a few times because I felt I needed to
escape an environment in which everyone was watching me.� I find it very
hard to be happy because of all of the experiences I have been through.�
One of the reasons I am finding these proceedings so hard is that
I don�t want my son to be taken from his parents and to go through the
care system like I did.�

 

12             
Today, in
relation to B, she has told me that B is a happy little boy and she wanted the
chance to look after him.� She said, �There are people out there who are
alcoholics like my mother�.� She wanted to be given a chance to bring him up,
she said, �You must understand how hard it is to lose a child�.

B�s Father

13             
F is older than
M.� Like M he desperately loves both his sons and wants to be able to bring
them up himself.� However, he, too, has difficulties not just because of his
intellectual limitations but because of difficulties in his own childhood.�
Indeed, during part of the time when M was pregnant with A he was serving a
sentence of imprisonment for robbery.� He told me today about how he can look
after his son and how he can meet all of his physical needs.� He said: �I�d
like to make him happy and laugh and I want to be able to care for him�.�
Ms. Vadgama, his counsel, told me that all he wants is to be given a
chance to be a proper dad.

THE LAW

14             
The relationship
between the parents and their children is crucially �important for the child
throughout all of his or her life.� The State can never, and should never,
interfere with that relationship unless the welfare of the child requires it.
The fact that �someone else can do a better job is not enough.� Separation is
necessary only if that the parents cannot meet the child�s needs and the
child�s welfare requires that they be separated.� With �adoption , separation
is almost a complete one.� This is why the State, through Parliament, has built
a structure in which the Court has to approach these decisions.� First, the
Section 31 Children Act 1989 threshold has to be satisfied.� Second, if the
threshold is satisfied, when the Court considers what orders to make, it has to
regard the child�s welfare as being paramount, that is, more important than any
other factors including the wishes of the parents or whether or not it is best
for the parents that a certain course is taken.

 

15             
A similar test
applies when the Court is considering making a placement order, but there the
paramount consideration is the child�s welfare throughout his life and
not just his childhood, because the impact of being adopted is likely, and is
intended, to effect the child throughout his life.� I also have to
consider all of the relevant circumstances including the likely effect on B
throughout his life of ceasing to be a member of M and F�s family and becoming
an adopted person.� The relationship he has with relatives and his only
relationship at the moment is with his parents and his brother.� The likelihood
of such a relationship continuing, the value of the child of that relationship
should continue.� I also have to have regard to the wishes and feelings of
the child�s relatives.� His parents� wishes are that he should go to live with
them.� 

 

16             
I can make a
placement order, that is, an order allowing the local authority to place B for
adoption, only if his parents consent or I decide that I can sdispense
with their consent.� They parents do not consent.� I am satisfied that
they do not consent because they genuinely believe it is best for B to live
with them and I respect that.� However, Parliament has provided me with
the power to dispense with their consent if I am satisfied that B�s
welfare requires it.� 

 

17             
In the case of Re
B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ.1146, the Court of Appeal gave guidance as
to how these decisions should be approached.� Making an adoption order without
the parents� consent is an extreme thing. It is a matter of last resort which
should be made only� where nothing else will do and where no other course is
possible in the child�s interests.� When I consider the options
I have which are to adjourn the case to allow B to live with his parents,
to make a care order with a view to his living with foster carers, or by being
adopted, I have to adopt the least interventionist approach which meets
the child�s needs.

 

18             
There are three
other matters I have to bear in mind.� First, I must never lose sight
of the fact that the child�s interests include being brought up by his natural
family, ideally by his parents, unless his welfare over-ridingly requires
something different.� Second, I have to explore all alternative solutions
before adopting the one proposed by the local authority.� Third, I have to
take into account the assistance and support which the local authority would
offer the parents if B were to live with them.�� 

THE THRESHOLD

19             
I am
satisfied that at the time the proceedings started, when B was only a few days
old, it was likely that he would suffer significant emotional harm resulting
from his parents:

 

(a)  continuing their cannabis misuse;

 

(b) failing to recognise, and have insight into, the risks
that their cannabis use would have on his welfare;

 

(c)  failing to take advantage of the
support which the local authority has made available for them both in terms of
their drug use and in terms of their own personal needs;

 

(d) their being unwilling to work with professionals and
their, at times, volatile and aggressive behaviour;

 

(e)  the father�s learning difficulties;

 

(f)   the reasons why A was taken from the
mother and the father�s care in August 2013.

 

The reasons why I am satisfied
that threshold is satisfied will, I hope, be obvious from the rest of this
judgment.

THE WELFARE CHECKLIST

B�s wishes and feelings

20             
I have to
consider B�s wishes and feelings and give them appropriate weight having regard
to their age and understanding.� B is so young that he cannot possibly
understand what is happening, or might happen to him, nor does he have the
maturity to be able to form a judgment of what is best for him.� With regard to
his feelings, his foster carer has been his parent figure throughout his 16
weeks of life and his feelings would be that he would want to remain with her.�
However, as he grows older his feelings might be that he would want to be with
his parents if at all possible, and if he could not do that then to be able to
understand that they loved him but were unable to look after him.

B�s Needs

21             
Like every child
B needs a stable, structured and loving environment where he can be
stimulated.� He needs to be safe.� If a child leads a life which threatens him,
where he is at risk of neglect because of difficulties facing the parents, for
example drug use, where he faces uncertainty about what will happen from day to
day, that is the sort of situation that can be solved in his not having what
the doctor called a secure attachment.� Looking at M�s �history one can �see
the effect of not having a secure attachment can have on a child, not just in
infancy, not just in childhood but also �in adult life. �B will also need to
grow up understanding (if he is to be adopted) that he is adopted, and that he
is not the natural child of his adopter.� He will also need information about
his parents so that he can develop a sense of his own identity. 

M�s and F�s ability to meet B�s Needs 

22             
In� August 2013
I decided that A�s parents were unable to look after him.� I made
that decision having read the very full report which had been prepared by a
team of independent child care specialists who had assessed whether or not they
could look after A.� The assessment lasted a number of weeks.� Their report was
very detailed and ran to more than 40 pages.� It said some very positive things
about the parents.� They engaged in playful interactions with A and were able
to soothe his distress and anxiety. �They generally presented themselves as
motived to learn and expressed an interest in what Awas being taught.� However,
M displayed some considerable difficulties about her ability to manage her
anxieties and to contain her emotions.� Frequently she acted in a volatile,
hostile and openly abusive way towards staff.� This affected her motivation to
succeed and to accept the help that the staff offered her.� It was the team�s
view that she did not have the emotional or behavioural resources with which to
undertake a twelve week residential assessment, and one could reasonably
predict that such a placement would be at a high risk of break down.� For that
reason they could not recommend that a full assessment was carried out.� 

 

23             
In those
proceedings A had a guardian from February 2013.� That guardian is B�s Guardian
as well, so she has known the family for 14 months.� In her report for the�
August proceedings she wrote:

 

�I do not consider that A can be
cared for by his parents and that any further assessment of them is unlikely to
be successful.� He is a very loved child.� His parents have bonded well with
him and there are some positive observations of their parenting.� They have
attended almost all of the contact sessions and have, to the best of their
ability, cooperated with professionals, but the weight of professional opinion
and my observations indicate that they would not be able to care safely for A,
would not be able to prioritise his needs and would not be able to offer care
that was calm, stable and consistent.

 

M has really struggled with managing
change and engaging with social services and it appears that any change, if
achievable, will take a very long time.� She has serious and long-standing
emotional psychological difficulties and has found it extremely difficult to
accept help for herself or to engage with services for A.� A is a very loved
child but he is also a young and vulnerable child who needs the security of a
family placement as soon as possible.� All involved are extremely sympathetic to
M and F but the focus must be on A and his needs for a long-term placement.�

 

24             
The question
I have to answer is whether any change has happened which makes it more
likely that the parents would be able to look after B than they would have been
able to look after A.� They are still living together and, as the Guardian has
commented, their strength is that they are mutually committed to each other.�
The love that was seen by everybody that they had for A is just as apparent for
B.� They are undoubtedly committed to him.� I have a report from a midwife
at the hospital where B was born which says:

 

�Staff have seen [M] talk to B and
cuddle him.� I have also observed this and seen very tender interactions
such as giving him Eskimo kisses.� M is responsive to his needs and will break
away from conversations with him if he moves to cry.� I am satisfied she
has bonded very well with B.� Overall she has behaved appropriately on the
ward.� There was concern about her being verbally aggressive to staff but she
had demonstrated an ability to prioritise her baby�s needs, had dramatically
decreased her smoking and rarely left the ward to smoke.� F appears to be
caring and supportive and has been able to undertake tasks such as washing and
shopping.� They have no concerns about his behaviour.� I also note that M
breastfeeds B.�

 

25             
The Guardian
wrote:

 

�B knows his parents and has
supervised contact with them four times a week.� The contact goes well and the
reports are positive.� His parents clearly love him very much and want to care
for him, but in my opinion they are unable to meet his long-term needs.�� 

 

There is no doubt that they could meet his basic needs of
washing and feeding him.� Contact has gone well, 

 

26             
The Child and
Adolescent psychiatrist� who interviewed M after A was born has seen her again,
this time with B.� When she saw her with B, she was impressed by the way M kept
looking at him.� She wrote:

 

�He was sticking out his tongue so
she copied him.� He made little cooing noises and she copied those as well.�
She talked to him about getting his bottle cooled and whilst she was talking to
him she would kiss his head but not in an intrusive way, and he appeared quite
relaxed.�

�

The psychiatrist� thought, as did the
Guardian, that M was much more relaxed with B than she was with A. �That is noteworthy
because she has been fearing that B would be taken from her.� 

 

27             
Those are all
very positive matters and indicate some change.� In addition M has been less
aggressive since B was born.� However, there are difficulties.� The first is
that since A was born the local authority has offered M and F a great deal of
personal support.� They have a personal adviser and they have made use of her.�
They have offered M a mental health screening but she attended only one in four
sessions.� She attended some obstetric appointments and scans but failed to
attend for two scans.� She attended an eight week psychotherapy group but when
she was then offered counselling sessions she failed to attend them.� She was
offered advice from another organisation but when she failed to keep most of
those appointments they closed the file in mid-March.� She has been offered
therapy at a further organisation but she did not attend many sessions. She is
starting a course with another organisation in the next few weeks.� She had not
engaged with any organisation in order to receive help her with drug and
alcohol misuse however but to some extent she had lessened her use of cannabis
during her pregnancy.� This shows that the parents are still finding it very difficult
to accept the help they need for a large number of areas in their lives.� 

 

28             
The local
authority would continue to offer support if M and F looked after B but that
support would be there to assist them, not to replace them as parents.� The
parents still continue to use cannabis regularly and frequently.� In December,
that is, during the last month of her pregnancy, M told someone that she was
still using cannabis several times a day.� What has happened outside contact
shows the sort of difficulties they are still encountering.� At some stage this
year the parents had made contact with someone whom it seems used them for
sexual purposes.� There are details in the psychiatrist�s report and I am
not going to repeat them. but they show they were either gullible or reckless.�
It was the sort of incident which would be completely inconsistent with their
looking after a baby. It would also� put the baby at risk of harm himself.

 

29             
In March there
were difficulties with their landlord.� When the guardian and the social worker
visited M and F by appointment they had found their flat to be tidy.� However,
when the landlord visited not by appointment it showed there were two dogs in
the premises, the parents had one dog themselves but were looking after another
dog for a friend.� There was urine and faeces on the floor, empty alcohol
bottles, the bed was not made and the place was generally untidy.� There were
also difficulties with neighbours and I am told that the landlords are
seeking to have them evicted.

 

30             
Faced with this
contrast between their improvements with B and their difficulties outside
contact, the professionals have had a difficult task in making recommendations
about B�s future.� The social worker says that she believes the parents have
made positive changes.� There was a time immediately after B�s birth when she
hoped this change could be harnessed and developed.� She hoped the change could
be built on.� She points to the fact that contact has been positive but that is
not a true reflection of reality. �They present a somewhat chaotic lifestyle
outside contact which suggests that their lives are not stable or consistent
with the needs of a young child.� If B were to be looked after by them even
with a high level of support they would be unable to keep him safe.

 

31             
In relation to
the cannabis use, the social worker says during the time immediately after B�s
birth M was not smoking cannabis and her behaviour was much calmer.� However,
she said:

 

�M is using cannabis again and
I fear she is not showing an ability to significantly reduce her use over
a sustained period.� I fear that the parents� cannabis use will mean that
they will be emotionally unavailable and this will affect their ability to give
good enough care to B.�� 

 

What she means by that is that the
parents are affected by cannabis.� They cannot react to a young child who needs
clues of what they want being picked up by a parent, and the parent then being
able to deal with the matter properly.� 

 

32             
The Child and
Adolescent psychiatrist� also considered the change.� She wrote at para.2.6 of
her report :

 

�What is different is the quality of
M�s relationship with B.� My observation of her contact reflects what has been
described by other professionals.� It is markedly different to my observation
of her interaction with A.� In many ways it was probably helpful just to see
her by herself with B.� She shows very good intuitive care.� She is attuned to
his needs, she uses her voice and eye contact to manage his arousal.�
Throughout the contact she followed his cues and worked very hard to make him
comfortable.� I think she has bonded with him and he is developing
positive attachment responses to her.� It is likely the period of time in
hospital following his birth contributed significantly to her being able to learn
how to read him and to start enjoying her role as a mother.� However, sadly
outside that interaction, not enough change has happened.� 

 

The most recent information in
relation to the sexual exploitation of the couple and a lack of capacity to
manage their home, as well as their ongoing drug and alcohol use, makes me very
concerned about their capacity to manage B safely in the community.� The big
issue for me is that they do not appear to be able to think about what they
need to do together to reassure professionals and facilitate B�s return to
their care.� Instead, they seem to have come up with their own plan which
cannot be challenged.� Sadly, the photographs I saw would indicate that
the dogs were being neglected and were living in poor conditions themselves in
the flat.� I wonder if on some level it was easy to choose that way of
showing they are good parents rather than doing the things that need to be done
to stop their cannabis and alcohol misuse and to engage in therapy.�

 

The doctor then went on to discuss
how the use of cannabis made them more vulnerable.

 

33             
The Child and
Adolescent psychiatrist� had been wondering whether or not to recommend that
they should be given a chance to undergo a residential assessment with B.�
However, the information about allowing a stranger into the flat, the general
state of the flat and the care of the dogs led the psychiatrist to change the
recommendation:


�I was of the opinion, given how good she was with B that residential placement
should be considered.� I am now however of the opinion that they remain
struggling to a significant level, and the time given trying to engage them in
a process of change has not moved them forward sufficiently.� They are a long
way from meaningful engagement with services such that I do not think the
delay which would be required to set up another residential placement would be
helpful for B in terms of his long-term care.�

�

Faced with this evidence, and the
expert opinion, I am satisfied that at the moment M and F are unable to meet
B�s needs.

The Local Authority�s Ability to� Meet B�s Needs

34             
A prospective
adopter for B has been found and B will being going to live with that
prospective adopter in the next two weeks or so.� The prospective adopter is a
single person who has expressed a willingness to look after both boys and to
adopt them.� Although the local authority have not yet completed the
formalities of selecting her as a suitable carer for B, they can see no reason
in the assessment that has been carried out of her why she would not be able to
look after both children, albeit that she is a single parent and would be
having to look after two very young children.If a placement order is made they
think it is likely that B would go to live with his brother and that
prospective adopter in the next two months. 

35             
�I am
satisfied that the local authority can, and will, put those plans into effect.�
I recognise that adoption does not guarantee success.� A and B are two
very young children and she is a single adopter.� However, she has been
assessed, she does not suffer from the same disadvantages as the parents and
she is likely to meet most, if not all, of B�s needs.

Risks and Benefits for B

36             
If B lives with
his parents he would undoubtedly have the benefit of their love, and
I have already dealt with how positive contact is, and that his parents
have a mutually supportive and affectionate relationship. 

37             
�However, there
are a long list of risks.� M is not equipped at the moment to look after
herself and B in the community.� F has a background of chronic neglect and poor
parenting in his childhood which is compounded by his learning difficulties and
his cannabis use.� He is not going to be able to step forward to fill the gaps
in M�s care, nor can she fill in the gaps in his care.� M herself has raised a
concern about F�s current mental state which is referred to in para.2.19 of the
psychiatrist�s report.

 

38             
As the social
worker has said, the parents� continued cannabis use, despite advice to the
contrary and despite twelve months of offers of help, risks them being
emotionally unavailable to B.� The state of their home at times shows that B
would be unsafe.� There is the risk that he would be exposed to unpredictable
anger on the part of his mother.� He cannot be guaranteed a consistently clean
and hygienic home environment.� There must be a serious question mark about
their ability to protect him from being sexually abused by other people.� It
also cannot be guaranteed that the parents will cooperate with professionals.�
Face to face, M�s cooperation has improved.� There is no longer the sort of
aggression that was being shown previously: that is a real step forward.�
However, on the other hand is the question of their accepting help and there is
not a good history in the last twelve months of consistent acceptance of help
to change their circumstances.

 

39             
If B does not
live with his parents there would be the certainty of a loss of a relationship
with them. Information about them can be provided by social services but that
is by far from being a substitute for a proper relationship with his birth
parents.� There is a risk that the adoptive placement could break down but, in
my judgment, that risk is far less than the placement breaking down if he is
with his parents.

 

40             
��Adoption would
bring� the benefit to B of most of his needs being met, the needs not being met
would be the benefits that most� children obtain from living with their birth
parents.� He would also have the benefit of probably living with his brother
and, as the guardian said, that would provide him with lifelong emotional
support.

 

 

Can Anyone Else Meet B�s Needs?

 

41             
No member of B�s
family other than M and F� who is able to offer him a permanent home has come
forward. 

DISCUSSION

Comparison Between Adoption and Being In Care

42             
�B�s guardian has
considered this in detail. 

 

�A long-term foster placement would
provide [B] with a safe and secure living environment where his parents would
continue to share parental responsibility, but this could not be considered
permanent and he would have the stigma and intrusion of continued local
authority involvement, for example, looked after review meetings, changes of
social worker and others knowing a great deal of personal information about his
background.� This would not be a normal childhood and there would also be a
sense of difference in his ability.� He could not remain in his current foster
home and he will be separated from his brother.� Such an arrangement will not
afford him the security of a permanent family for his childhood and beyond.�

 

43             
I do not have to
repeat M�s unhappy history to show how difficult it can be for a child spending
their childhood in foster care.� When I gave judgment in the case of A,
I said:

 

�M has her own experiences of a child
in foster care.� She has had the experiences of not being able to settle, of
families not taking responsibility for her and that made her very unhappy
indeed.� It made it very difficult for her now she is 18 to look after
herself.� I do not want A to have the same experience.� No matter how kind
a foster carer is to him, if he remains in care there is a real risk that the
time would come when the foster carer could not look after him, or the social
workers decide that he should move, and that would put him at the risk of the
same sort of life as M had.� Statistics show that the chance of adoption being
successful is much greater for a child than being in care.� It gives the child
a family who are committed to him, who love him not just for the next few weeks
and the next few months, but until he is 18 or the rest of his life.�

 

44             
The guardian in
her report makes the same comments:

 

�The brothers remaining together would
have enormous benefits for both of them.� There is no doubt that adoption would
represent a loss for B particularly in later life, and he would have been
deprived of the opportunity of being brought up by his birth parents.� This has
to be weighed against the delay, risk and difficulties of a further assessment
that a plan for reunification would bring.�

The Recommendations of the Experts

45             
��I emphasise
that this is not a case where I have to do what the experts recommend.�
I have to make my own decision and the order is my responsibility, not
theirs. 

46             
�B�s social
worker says:

 

�M and F have been consistent in
their wish to look after B together and it is clear they love him very much,
but the local authority believes they are unable to understand and implement
the necessary changes within his timescales.� It is the local authority�s view
that the parents are therefore unable to provide consistently safe and
emotionally sensitive care to a good enough standard.�

 

47             
The psychiatrist
says:

 

�In my opinion the current prognosis
is poor.� I would be concerned that there is evidence that M and F are
still very vulnerable young adults and any children placed in their care would
be at risk.� They have a very limited insight and capacity to protect themselves.�
As a result I think that B is not going to manage in their care.�

 

48             
The guardian says
in her report:

 

�I do not consider that M and F can
safely parent B and permanent, alternative arrangements are required.� The
positives are their obvious love for him, their commitment to attending
contact, and the positive contact reports.� Both have a level of practical
competence and manage well within the restrictions of the two hour contact
sessions that take place four times a week.� They have been less actively hostile
to professionals and M in particular has spoken about the care plan for A with
a maturity that I would not have envisaged twelve months ago.� The
concerns I have relate to continued lack of acceptance of any help, any
therapeutic help or acknowledgement of the adverse impact of substantial
cannabis use.� There is little acknowledgement or insight into the complexity
and extent of their difficulties as identified by all of the assessments thus
far and the demonstrable and continued difficulties in looking after and
protecting themselves.�

Should the Hearing be Adjourned?

 

49             
I have considered
adjourning the hearing to enable a residential assessment to be taken place.�
It is necessary that I do so because everything that can be done to see
whether B can live with his parents should be done provided he is not going to
suffer harm because of it.� The psychiatrist said that the parents were
struggling to a significant level and the time given trying to engage them in a
process of change has not moved them forward sufficiently. �I do not think
the delay that would be required to set up another residential placement would
be helpful for B in terms of his long-term care.�� 

50             
The guardian in
her report noted that a residential assessment for A had �not beenpossible:

 

�I do not think that there has been
sufficient changes to suggest that any further residential assessment would
reach different conclusions.� Information provided by such an assessment would
be limited, it would show how the parents manage within that particular
supervised environment and there is clear evidence they have struggled to
manage in the community despite having a high level of support.� I note
that the placement proposed would be unlikely to accept the parents prior to a
demonstrable period of abstinence from cannabis use.�

 

51             
I have to
remember that s.1(2) of the Children Act 1989 states the general principal that
any delay is likely to prejudice the welfare of a child.� B is three months old
which is a very sensitive period in his neurological development.� He requires
as much stability as possible and any move from his current home must so far as
possible be the final move.� 

 

52             
M and F �are
still using cannabis.� The likelihood that they will change is not something
that can be assessed over a short period of six weeks for the viability
assessment.� Their personality problems, particularly M�s, will need �time measured
in many months if not years to resolve or lessen.� M�s needs to be helped by �therapy
which will be painful.� Anyone who has undergone therapy knows how easy it is
to give up but the time required by the therapy to bring about change will also
be measured in many months if not years.� I am not satisfied that at the
end of a six week viability assessment the prospects that the parents would be
able to successfully complete a full assessment would be high enough to justify
the adverse effect on B of a delay taking place.� The older he is the more
difficult it will be to move him.� 

 

CONCLUSIONS

Should B live with his parents?

53             
Is it in B�s
interests to live �with his parents?� They cannot currently meet all of his
needs and, in my judgment, they will be unable to do so for some years.� If he did
live with them it is highly likely that he would have to �return to care.� He would
then be older, he will be badly effected by his experiences at home, there will
be further delay in finding him a permanent home and there is a risk that he
would not be able to live with his brother.� With great sadness, because
I recognise how much the parents love him, I am satisfied that he
cannot return to his parents. It is not in his wider interests.

Should B live with foster carers?

54             
For the reasons
the guardian has given, it is not in the interest of a child of B�s age to be
placed in long-term foster care. In addition� B would also lose his
relationship with his brother.

Should B be adopted?

 

55             
Adoption is the
harshest and far reaching of all of the options.� I can, and should, only
make the order if I am satisfied that B�s welfare demands it.� I am
satisfied that it does.� He cannot wait in the slight hope that something is
going to change which will make his parents become able to look after him.�
Adoption offers by far the greatest chance of growing up in a stable home which
can meet most of his needs.� I am satisfied it is necessary in his
interests.

authority proposes that contact between B and his parents should be reduced
until he is placed for adoption and then direct contact should cease.� They
would arrange for communication by letters between his adopter, and as he grows
older between B, and his parents twice a year.� M and F� will need help with
that. 

57             
�Letters are not
a very satisfactory way of communicating information about one�s parents and it
would be much better if this could happen face to face.� I have to
consider whether or not it would be in his interests to have contact with his
parents after adoption.� At the moment M and F� have not met the prospective
adopter.� She is willing to meet them and they are willing to meet her.� The
local authority wants to arrange a meeting. 

 

58             
I have to
bear in mind that the Court of Appeal has decided that courts should rarely, if
ever, make a contact order after adoption unless the adopter agrees.� At the
moment the adopter does not agree- although neither does she disagree.
Currently she does not know all of the circumstances.

 

59             
��I also
have to bear in mind the emotional situation.� First, the emotional situation
of B.� He does not know who his parents are.� Although there will come a time
when he may intellectually know that they are his birth parents, that will be
some years in the future.� After he moves to live with the prospective adopter,
he will feel that she is his emotional parent.� In those circumstances, meeting
people who are emotionally involved and emotionally aroused and saying they are
his parents would risk him being really confused.

��������� The second matter
I have to bear in mind is the parents� emotional situation.� I cannot
begin to imagine what it must be like for a parent to see their child who has
been adopted.� There must be a real mixture of emotions and it would require a
great deal of strength and courage and ability to control their emotions and
behaviour to avoid upsetting the child.� Third, there is the situation of the
adopter.� In adoption� that child becomes the adopter�s, not in a legal sense
of ownership but in the emotional sense of being 100% committed to the child.�
Naturally, adopters will feel that there is a risk that somehow either the
child will be upset by the contact or that they will lose their child�s love. 

 

60             
�These are very
difficult and sensitive situations.� Even if I could legally make an order
for contact beyond adoption, I would not make it now because I do not
know how all these factors will come into play in the circumstances of this
particular case.

 

61             
The local
authority has a duty to consider contact between now and the adoption� .� They
have a duty to discuss post- adoption contact with the adopter.� They have told
me they are going to discuss it with the adopter and the parents, and
I accept that.� I cannot at present be satisfied that such an order
would be in B�s best interests.� It may be beneficial� in the future but
I do not know.

Dispensing with M�s and F�s consent to a Placement Order

62             
Before
I make a placement order I need the consent of M and F . Because they do
not consent, I have to be satisfied before dispensing with their consent�
that a placement order is necessary and in B�s best interest.� As I have
already said, in my judgment adoption is the only order which will meet B�s
needs as far as they can be met. I am satisfied that it is necessary and in his
best interests and therefore I am able to dispense with their consent and do
so. 

63             
�I grant the
Placement order knowing that the local authority have found a home where it is
probable he will be able to live with his brother. I regard as being very
important.

64             
��I have
reached my decision with great sadness because, like the guardian, the social
worker and the psychiatrist, I had hoped that there might have been a
change. M and F have not failed their son.� No one could really expect them to
mature and to change within such a short period of time.� I  hope for
their own sakes that despite the great sadness and anger they will feel at the
second child being removed from them, they will be able to look to the future
and to accept the help which is genuinely being offered to them.

  Hearing dates: 7 � 11 April 2014  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   (DRAFT/APPROVED) JUDGMENT     Introduction  In these proceedings I am concerned for four children. The eldest is W, a boy aged 8 1/2. Next is Z, aged 7 1/2. Next comes Y, aged three. Last comes Z, aged 1 1/2. The mother of all of the children of AB. The father of W and X is CD, who does not have parental responsibility for them. He has played no part in these proceedings although the social worker has met with him and encouraged him to do so. The father of Y and Z is EF, although he does not have parental responsibility for the girls. It had been thought AB's partner was the father of Z but DNA testing confirmed it was in fact EF. Her partner was first discharged as a party but made an intervener and at the last hearing I discharged him as an intervener as there was no role to him to play in these proceedings. The other two people of significance in this case are GH and IJ who have been assessed as long term carers for Y. It is important to record that Z has cystic fibrosis and is under a paediatrician at a major local hospital in respect of this. Consistent medical treatment is crucial as her condition is one which will impact on her life expectancy and quality of life. With treatment current life expectancy on average is thought to be around forty or better, whereas without appropriate treatment this condition can be fatal in childhood. Care of a child with CF is hard work, with medication being needed every time she eats as well as chest physiotherapy twice daily. Her paediatrician notes how her medical health has dramatically improved whilst she has been in foster care.  The local authority sought emergency protection orders in respect of all four children on 18 October 2013. That order was made by the magistrates until 25 October. It seems there were existing concerns, largely regarding AB's alcohol use and mental health issues, and the local authority was involved from October 2012 under Child Protection Plans. There was then an incident involving AB and her partner who when in drink had self harmed resulting in the mother having to go to hospital and it was this that led to the making of emergency protection orders. The children were removed from the care of their mother and placed in foster care, spread across three placements with W and X being placed together. The children have been subject to interim care orders since 28 October when the extended emergency protection orders expired. The children see their mother three times a week for one hour although her attendance has not been entirely consistent this year. EF has not been able to have consistent contact with Y due to his physical location and his work commitments and he has only been able to see Z once during these proceedings.  At the case management hearing on 6 November 2013 various directions were given including DNA testing of Z and psychiatric assessment of the mother and her partner. Viability assessments of family members were also to be carried out as well as efforts being made to locate CD. At the next hearing alcohol testing was directed in respect of the mother and her partner and drug testing regarding the mother. EF was also to be DNA tested in relation to Z. At the next hearing the case was timetabled to final hearing before me, the case having previously been managed by another circuit judge.  There was a consent application later to retimetable once it was confirmed EF was indeed Z's father. The local authority unfortunately did not keep to that timetable meaning matters were not ready to be properly considered at the issues resolution hearing and indeed it was only at this hearing started the bulk of the evidence was finally gathered. Helpfully at the issues resolution hearing matters did clarify to some extent. Threshold was almost able to be agreed between the parties and a document was added to the bundle after the hearing reflecting that agreement, which document has then been amended further and signed by AB once Ms Astbury had instructions from her lay client. It also became clear that the mother did not seek the return of any of the children to the care of her and her partner, meaning issues narrowed and he could be discharged as an intervener. It was also clear that nobody disputed Y being placed with her aunt and uncle although there was an issue as to the order under which that should take place. Future contact remained a general issue in the case. This hearing was due to commence on Monday, the first day being a reading day but evidence being due to begin on Tuesday. On Tuesday however I was informed that AB had been arrested for arson with intent to endanger life. I was told that she had the day before argued with her partner, self harmed and set fire to her flat, one of three in a building. Having tried to gather more information and after discussions with the advocates we eventually adjourned to the following day. On Wednesday I was told that AB had indeed been charged with arson with intent to endanger life and been remanded in custody to appear at the magistrates court that day. It was anticipated she would be remanded in custody following that hearing. Ms Astbury had very helpfully tried to get instructions from her client but she was understandably distressed and not a lot of progress could be made. Ms Astbury made an application for the hearing to be adjourned but this was opposed by the local authority and guardian who emphasised the need for the children for final decisions to be made as soon as possible. It was feared an identified possible long term placement for W and X might be lost and it was also said that searches for possible adopters for Z needed to be got under way as quickly as possible. I took the view that AB had been fit to attend court on Wednesday and I felt therefore should be in a position to engage with this court on Thursday and Friday, thus avoiding any delay for her children. She was indeed produced yesterday and Ms Astbury was able to have a constructive meeting with her and obtain instructions such that this hearing could proceed.   The Issues and the Evidence  In preparing for this hearing I have read the full bundle of papers provided to me in this matter and I have heard evidence in court from just the social worker and the guardian. I shall consider each of the parties� cases in turn. The local authority's plans for W and X are that they should be placed together in long-term foster care under care orders. In respect of Y, the local authority's plans had changed between the filing of final evidence and the beginning of this hearing. The local authority had been recommending that she should be placed with her paternal aunt and her partner under a special guardianship order. However checks had not been completed and as a result the finalised special guardianship assessment and support plan had not been concluded. The potential carers had seen solicitors and expressed reservations, not about caring for Y but about support needed and the appropriate orders. As result the local authority amended its plan to one of the making of an interim care order whilst assessments were concluded. Z, the local authority proposes, should be made subject to care and placement orders as there is no possible family placement for her. The local authority is clear that a child of Z�s age who cannot live within her birth family should not remain in care if there is the possibility of an adoptive family. For that to be pursued a placement order is necessary. It acknowledges that Z may not be easy to place given her serious health needs and says if after a period of six to nine months an adoptive placement is not found she should remain in long-term foster care, hopefully with her current carer who would be keen to keep her. The local authority's plans for the children are supported by the guardian for W, X and Z. The guardian did not however agree with the plan for Y when it was one of special guardianship. The guardian's view was that that placement needed to be under a care order. It would be fair to say that her preference would have been, I think, for the proceedings regarding Y to conclude. On the first day of this hearing I expressed some reservations about that approach, indicating I felt this might be one of those cases where some ongoing court involvement, keeping the guardian involved, would be appropriate. The guardian has not sought to disagree with me in that regard. In terms of contact, it is proposed that there should be a gradual reduction of contact between the children and their parents, the pattern being set out in the care plans. In the longer term it is proposed that W and X should have supervised contact with their mother six times a year for four hours on each occasion, contact to take place in school holidays. It is also proposed the children should continue to have contact with their maternal grandmother overnight once a month with longer periods in school holidays and additional phone contact. The local authority says there needs to be a balance between the children's need for stability in their placement and a relationship with their mother. The social worker said it was important that contact at a manageable level for the mother to minimise the chance of her letting them down as they are sad when she does not attend. The social worker's view was that the four hour contact proposed, which she clearly envisaged would be activity-based, would be an opportunity to the family to have a really nice day out rather the current one hour contact sessions. She did not deny that the core assessment showed how important the mother was the children and indeed everything I have read confirms that relationship. The social worker also acknowledged that W worried about how his mother was given his experiences in her care. It is envisaged that Y would have supervised contact with her mother monthly until matters are finalised by this court, thereafter the local authority's plans are currently for contact six times a year by her joining the supervised contacts between W, X and their mother. Contact with her father is proposed to be monthly, ultimately supervised by one of her carers.  Were Z to be adopted the proposal would be for annual letterbox contact with her mother, father and siblings, although the plans placed before me said twice annually. If she were to remain in foster care the plan would be supervised contact six times a year with her mother and siblings and six times a year with her father, also with some contact with her maternal grandmother.  The local authority has been clear since the outset as to its concerns regarding AB and her partner. The local authority became involved due to concerns regarding her mental health and her alcohol misuse, together with ongoing concerns regarding anti-social behaviour, lack of supervision of the children, W�s school attendance and a number of missed health appointments including in respect of Z, a particularly concerning matter.  I have read the core assessment carried out by the local authority dated 31 October 2013 which is very clear about the extent of the concerns, although I am not going to set these out in great detail here because of the acceptance by the mother of threshold and that the children will not be returning to her care. It is quite clear though that prior to the issue of proceedings the care of the children was by no means good enough and the children were exposed to their mother's mental health difficulties and alcohol misuse in a way no child should be. That is particularly sad because equally it was evident that AB had worked hard to provide her children with loving care and had clearly given good parenting in a number of areas evidenced by the generally good behaviour of the children and the affection and caring relationships between the siblings and between the children and their mother.  Reading the parenting assessment of the couple and the social worker's most recent statement, it is clear that misuse of alcohol has continued to be a problem for AB over the life of the court case and there have been further incidents of violence at her home and extensive damage, AB and her partner self harming and one incident where the mother threatened suicide. Her attendance at contact was also problematic from mid-January onwards, related to alcohol issues as well as self-harm incidents.  The extensive nature of AB�s problems is very clear from the reports of Dr Mortimer in respect of her and her partner. She notes AB is diagnosed with a mixed �cluster B� personality disorder of some severity, comprising both antisocial and borderline traits which has impacted very severely on her ability to care for her children. The prognosis Dr Mortimer says would have to be very guarded. She talked of therapy taking approaching twelve months and possibly more like two years given the extent of AB's difficulties, whilst also noting that AB had a very long way to go before she could approach treatment readiness. The assessment regarding her partner was remarkably similar, leaving me very concerned at the prospect of two such damaged people parenting children. I have also noted the guardian�s comments regarding AB in her final analysis. She says there: �When I discussed the psychiatrist report with AB she very clearly said that she did not accept the conclusion or the diagnosis. When I focused on the recommendation of the report, AB did not accept that she needed to take antipsychotic medication. AB has used self-harm as a means of relieving tension and frustration over a number of years. AB also has longstanding issues with alcohol. She has admitted that she only self-harms when she had drunk alcohol and without alcohol she is able to manage her feelings.�  19.  In respect of CD, the father of W and X, he has played no part in these proceedings. The social worker met him once during the proceedings as he was at the home of AB when she visited for an assessment session. However since then he has made no contact with the social worker and has not responded to letters written by her and her legal department asking him to engage with the care proceedings. A phone number the guardian had been given for him has been disconnected so she has not been able to meet with him. I am satisfied that he is aware of the proceedings and that it is appropriate to proceed in his absence. 20.  EF has never sought to be assessed as a carer for Y. He had had intermittent content that Y since her birth including staying contact overnight on at least two occasions. Prior to her being received into local authority care Y had not had contact with her father since June 2013. As soon as he became aware she was in foster care he made contact with the local authority and was keen to resume contact. He did not however seek to be assessed to care for Y, proposing rather that his sister, GH, and her partner, IJ, be assessed as carers for Y. A viability assessment was positive, as was a full kinship assessment. After it became clear that, rather to his surprise, he was indeed the father of Z, EF put himself forward to be assessed to care for her. That assessment was negative and when considered alongside police evidence relating to a charge of assault by EF in respect of his older daughter, R, and some aspects of his criminal history, the local authority was clear it could not place Z in his care.  21.  I should say for completeness that GH and IJ considered carefully if they could offer to care for Z alongside Y but, understandably maybe, felt this was more than they could manage. 22.  AB's case is in many ways quite straightforward. She does not seek to care for any of her children, seeing the difficulties in her situation. She therefore accepts W and X remaining in long-term foster care. In respect of Y she notes the plan for Y to be placed with her aunt and uncle but understands that this aspect of the proceedings will be adjourned for fuller assessments. The local authority proposes that her contact will be monthly with Y pending final hearing and AB accepts that. She also agrees to EF having parental responsibility for Y and Z. 23.  AB takes issue with two aspects of the local authority's plans to her children. In respect of W and X she believes the reduction in contact to six times a year is too great and she would ask for that to be monthly. She points to the very good quality contact and the evidence in the core assessment of a positive relationship between her and the children. She says through Ms Astbury that her view is that monthly contact would better meet the children�s needs for an ongoing good relationship with her and, the point was made, would avoid W in particular worrying about her. It was suggested that it would be better to set contact at a monthly level and see how it goes before reducing it further only if necessary, an active review process. 24.  In respect of Z, AB opposes the making of a placement order. She is pleased that it seems Z can remain in her current foster placement and believes that is how Z's needs would best be met. She would want to maintain direct contact with Z and would wish it to be at the level of monthly contact, the level of contact she would seek with all of her children. 25.  EF through counsel is clear that he wishes to have the best possible relationship with his daughters. As with the mother, he does not wish to Z to be placed for adoption. He would have wished to care for her if his situation had been different in respect of the charges regarding his elder daughter. He believes Z's needs are being well met in a current placement and he would wish to remain there. It would be his hope that some point in the future he may be at pursue his case to care for her once when the proceedings are out of the way, although Mr Burdon acknowledged he could but no timeframe on this and therefore could not be a strong point. 26.  At the commencement of the evidence in this case therefore, the issues I had to deal with were very limited and were as follows: a.       The level of contact between W and X and their mother. b.      Whether I should make a placement order in respect of Z. c.       If I did not make a placement order in respect of Z, the level of contact between her and her mother. Decision  27.  I now turn to consider what orders if any are in the best interests of each of the children. I start very clearly from the position that, wherever possible, children should be brought up by their natural parents and if not by other members of their family. The state should not interfere in family life so as to separate children from their families unless it has been demonstrated to be both necessary and proportionate and that no other less radical form of order would achieve the essential aim of promoting their welfare. In their Re B [2013] UKSC 33 the Supreme Court emphasised this, reminding us such orders are �very extreme�, and should only be made when �necessary� for the protection of the child�s interests, �when nothing else will do�. The court �must never lose sight of the fact that (the child�s) interests include being brought up by her natural family, ideally her parents, or at least one of them� and adoption �should only be contemplated as a last resort�. I have looked again at the words of the President in Re B-S (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1146 as well as the judgments in Re B (supra) and reminded myself of the importance of addressing my mind to all the options for this children, taking into account the assistance and support which the authorities or others would offer.  28.  In reaching my decision I have taken into account that each of the children�s welfare is my paramount consideration and also that I need to make the least interventionist order possible. I have to consider the Article 8 rights of the adults and each of the children as any decision I make today will inevitably involve an interference with the right to respect to family life. I must be very careful to ensure that any orders I make are in accordance with law, necessary for the protection of the children�s rights and is proportionate. I am also very conscious that I must have in mind the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child, relevant here to Z. Parental Responsibility for Y and Z 29.  As a preliminary matter, I am going to look at the question of parental responsibility for Y and Z. EF does not have parental responsibility for the girls and at the IRH I raised the question of whether this should be addressed.  30.  The Children Act gives no guidance on when parental responsibility should be granted. The children�s welfare is the paramount consideration and it must be better for the children that I make an order than not. The welfare checklist in s1(3) need not apply to such an application. The leading case for many years has been Re H (1991) 1 FLR 214 where the Court of Appeal held that the court would take a number of factors into account, including  -          the degree of commitment which the applicant had shown towards the child -          the degree of attachment which existed between them -          his reasons for applying for the order. In Re G (1994) 1 FLR 504 it was held that those factors are not exhaustive but indicative. However, if those factors are present then prima facie it would be in the child�s welfare for a parental responsibility order to be made. 31.  EF has had contact with Y throughout her life, not necessarily consistently but he has certainly shown a commitment to her. Evidence from contact shows an attachment between Y and her father. The situation with Z is slightly different as EF did not know he was her father until DNA testing within these proceedings. He then immediately sought have a relationship with her and offered himself as a potential carer, albeit he has had limited contact with her. From the evidence I have read generally about him he has a commitment to all of his children even though they are not in his care and clearly his role as a father is important to him. I note also that AB and the local authority agree to EF having parental responsibility for the girls. 32.  Neither Y nor Z is going to be in the care of EF but that is not a reason for not reflecting his legal relationship with them. I am satisfied that the factors identified in Re H are present in this case and that it is right that an order should be made in respect of Y and Z granting parental responsibility to EF.  Z 33.  As the decision I have to make respect of Z is by far the most significant to be considered today, I am going to deal with her first. I have to ask myself whether she should remain in long-term foster care, hopefully in her current placement, or have the possibility of an adoptive placement, and I have to balance the pros and cons of each of the options being presented to me. McFarlane LJ in Re G [2013] EWCA Civ 965 said �What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options.� In addressing this task I have considered all the points in the welfare checklists contained in both the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002, and I propose to consider the evidence in the light of those factors.  34.  We are often told that the factors in the welfare checklist are not set out in any order of hierarchy. In this case it seems to me maybe the most crucial factor for me to address is Z's needs, alongside consideration of her age, sex, background and any characteristics of hers which the court considers relevant. Z is a child with very real special needs as a result of her medical condition. She needs carers who can offer extremely high quality care, meeting her emotional and physical needs, both of which may be significantly heightened due to her medical condition. She needs carers who are able to make a commitment for the entirety of her life however long that is. She needs to have the most normal life that she can � she is a child who is going to stand out by virtue of her medical condition and she needs no other identifying characteristics. 35.  In pondering this heading I remind myself of the words of Black LJ in Re V [2013] EWCA Civ 913. There she said: 
�95. Also entering the picture is C's view. The judge thought she may have been given a rosy tinted view of adoption and not told that long term fostering could provide the same security. My difficulty with that is that I do not think that fostering and adoption can, in fact, be equated in terms of what they offer by way of security. I do not intend to embark on a comprehensive comparison of the two arrangements, merely to highlight some of the material differences. What I say should not be taken as a substitute for professional advice to the court from social services and/or the guardian in any case in which this is a significant issue.  96. With that caveat, I make the following observations:  i) Adoption makes the child a permanent part of the adoptive family to which he or she fully belongs. To the child, it is likely therefore to "feel" different from fostering. Adoptions do, of course, fail but the commitment of the adoptive family is of a different nature to that of a local authority foster carer whose circumstances may change, however devoted he or she is, and who is free to determine the caring arrangement.  ii) Whereas the parents may apply for the discharge of a care order with a view to getting the child back to live with them, once an adoption order is made, it is made for all time.  iii) Contact in the adoption context is also a different matter from contact in the context of a fostering arrangement. Where a child is in the care of a local authority, the starting point is that the authority is obliged to allow the child reasonable contact with his parents (section 34(1) Children Act 1989). The contact position can, of course, be regulated by alternative orders under section 34 but the situation still contrasts markedly with that of an adoptive child. There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement. Once the adoption order has been made, the natural parents normally need leave before they can apply for contact.  iv) Routine life is different for the adopted child in that once he or she is adopted, the local authority have no further role in his or her life (no local authority medicals, no local authority reviews, no need to consult the social worker over school trips abroad, for example).� I cannot better the words of Black LJ in setting out the conventional thinking on why adoption is a better outcome generally for a small child then foster care. What she sets out here is very much in line with what the guardian and social worker said in their evidence. 36.  I am very conscious that were I to make a placement order there would be a change in Z�s circumstances if an adoptive home were found for her. She is clearly receiving very good care in her current foster placement and I am sure has formed a strong relationship with her carer. I do not minimise the impact on her were she to be moved from there but social workers are skilled in assisting children with this and I have no doubt that would be true in this case. I do not think as a result of moving her she would suffer harm within the meaning of the Children Act 1989. I fully accept that the current carer, if she were to be Z's long-term foster carer, would be capable of meeting all of her needs, save that of the emotional need for one's own parents which could only be met by adoption, given that Z cannot be brought up by either of her parents. Her carer I am told is of the view that the local authority should look for an adoptive family Z and is not offering herself in that role, and that is something I have considered carefully given that she has I understand two other adopted children so knows something of the commitment required from an adopter. 37.  I also do not minimise the impact on a child of the loss of birth family relationships, including in Z's case with her three older siblings, and these are key factors in the balancing exercise I have to carry out. Given that she does not reside with any of them those links are not as strong as they once probably were but there is the potential in the future for any or all of these relationships to become more significant. That will be lost to all intents and purposes if Z is adopted as the only contact proposed is indirect contact. Family links are very important to any child as they grow up and indeed in adulthood. However I have to balance those family links with Z's needs for her own forever family. If there is indirect contact then Z will know of her siblings and would have the option of making contact with them later. I know that is not the same thing as having an ongoing relationship but it keeps the possibility of links with her birth family open in a way that is not always been the case with adoptions. 38.  I also have to consider the impact of delay on a child and this is relevant to Z. Were she not able to remain where she currently is placed if adoption does not come about then the act of spending six to nine months looking for an adoptive placement could cause her harm. However it seems very hopeful that she will be able to remain in her current placement as a long-term placement if an adoptive home is not found for her. 39.  I acknowledge that I have no evidence before me as to how placeable Z is. Any court though knows that the chances of her being placed are far lower than most little girls of her age. I am satisfied though that she deserves the chance of an adoptive family with all the security that that brings with it. I have heard that the local authority very sensibly intend to time limit the search to six to nine months and the guardian supports that. If within that time an adoptive family has not been found for Z the local authority will put in hand the steps needed to ensure Z can remain in her current placement as a long-term foster placement.  40.  In respect of Z then, having carried out the balancing exercise that I must which has been a particular difficult one for me as well as the social worker and guardian, I am satisfied that her needs for stability and permanence can only be met in an adoptive placement. I am satisfied that the local authority�s final care plan for Z is proportionate and (in the context of both s1(1) Children Act 1989 and s1(2) Adoption and Children Act 2002) in her best welfare interests. I therefore make a care order in respect of Z. I am also satisfied that Z�s welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of AB and EF and to placing her for adoption, the word �require� here again having the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, �the connotation of the imperative�. I make a placement order authorising the local authority to place Z for adoption.  41.  Much was said in court about the question of letterbox contact between Z and her family. The local authority's plan originally was that information will be shared in two directions twice each year between Z, her mother, her father, and her siblings. The guardian queried that, pointing out that that in effect meant six lots of contact a year, with the potential to destabilise the placement and also a significant requirement on potential adopters. The social worker having considered that changed her recommendation to annual indirect contact, an approach supported by the guardian.  42.  The mother understandably would wish to have as much contact as possible. The problem is that is very hard in the abstract to know whether or not such contact is beneficial all not for the child. The purposes of indirect contact I remind myself is to assist a child with her sense of identity, not to keep the parents in touch with her life even though that would be a much valued side-effect. In terms of the impact on Z of indirect contact, one cannot know it throughout her life she will be a child who will find such reminders of her past positive or negative. Equally in terms of the impact on adopters of providing indirect contact, one cannot know if they will happily comply or find it a burden or a worry. The social worker and the guardian were both clear it would be worse for the birth family if indirect contact was expected and did not happen. The social worker's view was that it might be best to set contact at an annual level and be confident adopters could maintain that and from the point of view of the birth family I would agree with that. It may be that adopters found for Z would feel able to promote more indirect contact if they felt it to be needed by Z, particularly with her brother and sisters, but I do not think that I can be prescriptive about that. If carers are found who are able to make a permanent commitment to Z then I am confident they will do what is best for her in respect of indirect contact and will think about the positives and negatives it brings for her. I would definitely say that whatever indirect contact is sent to Z and her family should be gathered into one envelope by those responsible at the local authority for letterbox contact to minimise potential upset not just to Z but to her new parents. It will then be for them to work out how to share that information with Z in a way that best meets her needs. 43.  There is one direction I wish to make linked to the placement order. I think it is hugely important for children who are adopted that they have information available to them, through their adoptive parents, so they can make sense of their early life. This judgment, in setting out what I have read and heard in court, gives at least a summary of that start and also sets out my thoughts in respect of indirect contact. Whilst it will be placed in an anonymised form in the public domain it is important that it is easily available to those who will be bringing Z up. I propose therefore to make a direction that this judgment should be released by the Local Authority to Z�s adopters so that it is available to her in future life.  44.  I should also record that the local authority was clear that contact would be maintained between Z, her parents and her siblings up to her being placed to adoption so that, were she not to be placed, she would not have lost her birth family links. W and X 45.  I then turn to the other children. It is agreed that there should be care orders in respect of W and X given that they cannot return to their mother�s care and I make those orders. I then need to consider the appropriate level of contact for them with their mother.  46.  The children have a good relationship with their mother and I am quite sure they want to go on having contact with her. There is no suggestion that contact when it is taken place has been anything other than good for the children. I am conscious that this year contact has been much less consistent, it seems due to the mother's use of alcohol and her general mental health. Since the middle of January a significant number of contact sessions have been missed by AB. Obviously her arrest this week has caused a hiatus in contact and if she is to remain imprisoned for some time may mean contact is not restarted in the near future as the mother and local authority are both of the view that it would not be ideal to take the children to the prison. I have no doubt that the children are upset and confused when contact does not happen and this will impact on their emotional well-being. They need a good quality relationship with their mother for which they need consistent contact to take place.  47.  That need needs to be balanced against the need for a secure permanent home and for sense of stability in that placement. We know that W and X are likely to be moving in the near future to a long-term placement, hopefully that one which is currently being pursued. Y is hopefully going to have a move to her family placement in the same kind of time frame. The children are going to need time to adjust to the coming changes and then need time to settle in their placements. That may well necessitate the need for flexibility in respect of contact arrangements. The local authority says that the right level of contact in the longer term for the children is six times a year with their parents and with each other, although possibly with some additional contact organised the siblings between their carers. It is anticipated that contact will happen in school holidays to avoid disruption to their day-to-day lives and will be contact for about four hours in duration, a good length of contact. The social worker�s view is that such contact will allow for meaningful relationships to be maintained without the children being disrupted. They may well be times in their lives when more or less contact is needed and the local authority needs to be able to act accordingly. 48.  The guardian supported that level of contact recommended by the local authority, whilst agreeing it needed to be constantly reviewed in both LAC reviews and within the Area Office although her evidence did tend towards a review not some time. Her view was if it was positive it could maybe be increased, the IRO liaising with the children as to their wishes. She acknowledged the strength of the relationship between the children and their mother and the generally good quality contact and she felt in reaching her decision she had taken into account the positives as well as negatives.. For her a particular problem was that the mother was currently in prison and therefore there had to be a hiatus in contact. She also felt one had to consider the pattern of contact including the extremely important contact between the children and their grandmother, who had never let them down and which they thoroughly enjoy it worth their contact with their mother was she agreed tinged with anxiety as to whether she would attend and whether she would be well. 49.  I very much understand that AB wants to have as much contact as she can with her children and to maintain a meaningful role in their lives. She will remain their mother and will continue to see them but she has to accept that, difficult though that is, it is not going to be the same as when she was bringing them up herself. I do agree that it is unusual for a mother to be able to accept that it is best to her children to be brought up outside her family and that is definitely to AB's credit. There is a real positive to the children in her being able to give them reassurance that she agrees to this plan they do not need to think they are being disloyal to her in attaching to a new family. Contact with her will be a positive way that message being given to the children, assuming she can keep to this approach. A reduction in contact is of course in itself a way of giving the message to the children that they are not returning to their mother's care but the effect of a positive reinforcement of this from her cannot be underestimated. 50.  It is also proposed that W and X should go on having contact with their maternal grandmother as they do now and it is anticipated that will be on a monthly basis and includes some overnight contact. I have been told the children very much enjoy that contact. The mother does not seek to prevent that contact in any way but does not want the amount of contact the children are having with their grandmother to be the reason why they should have less with her due to the total number of contacts. I acknowledge that but equally I think simple uncomplicated family contact, here with their grandmother, is going to be very important to the children as they go through a period of many changes in their lives and have to come to terms with the fact that they are not going to live together again as a family with their mother and siblings. 51.  The problem I am faced with is that as a judge I am not sure that I know at this precise moment in time what arrangements are best for W and X. The social worker and guardian are both of the view that contact six times a year with their mother, ie just in school holidays, is the best level to enable them to settle in their placement and attach to their long term carers whilst maintaining a meaningful relationship with their mother. The mother says that the children are close to her and need to keep that relationship throughout their childhoods as they will continue to be part of their birth family throughout their lives. Both of those statements are valid but I do not think one can be prescriptive about what contact is required at this moment and be confident that will remain the right level. I was slightly troubled that the social worker suggested she would not be open in review to the possibility of contact being increased from six times a year. I would hope she and indeed the independent reviewing officer would act each and every review (and indeed in between reviews) be looking at whether the level of contact at that time was meeting the children's needs. In other cases with which I have been involved social workers and guardians have supported higher levels of contact such as monthly contact, even where parents have opposed plans the children to be placed in foster care, which has not been the case here. Contact as a whole needs to be looked at together, ie including the grandmother's contact. I can see the difference in the potential impact on the children of contact with their grandmother, whose role in their life seems always to have been positive, and their mother, who much she has loved them and cared for them has also cause them harm. The reaction therefore for the children in seeing their mother and their grandmother could well be different but only time will tell. 52.  I make these comments because I am not going to make a defined contact order because of the importance of flexibility and I am satisfied that the arrangements need to be left in the of the local authority�s hands. However I am going to direct that this judgment is sent by the local authority to the children's independent reviewing officer so that I can be confident he or she is aware of what I have said regarding the need for active review of contact, particularly between the children and their mother. It may well be there is a need for more regular reviews, whether formal or otherwise, in the early stages of the children's placement to ensure that contact is at a level which meet their needs. 53.  Having conducted the required balancing exercise then, I am satisfied that the local authority�s final care plan for W and X is proportionate and (in the context of both s1(1) Children Act 1989 and s1(2) Adoption and Children Act 2002) in their best welfare interests and I approve it, whilst wishing my comments here to be conveyed to the IRO. Y 54.  The plan for Y is that she should be subject to further interim care orders whilst the assessments of her aunt and uncle are carried out and, hopefully, she is placed in their care. It is proposed that she has monthly contact with each of her parents pending the final hearing, and I emphasise this as it is not entirely clear from the care plan last filed that this is the local authority's position. Her parents are content that the longer term plans for contact are looked at the final hearing for her, when both may wll seek contact at a higher level than that envisaged by the local authority. EF�s concern is that his sister who it is anticipated will be caring for Y supervises his contact with another child and that restricting his contact with Y will impact on the other contact. The local authority is aware of his concerns and can address this in its final evidence. 55.    In respect of Y I make a further interim care order for period of twenty eight days, thereafter to continue to be renewed in the usual administrative manner. I note the plan for her to have contact with each of her parents once a month until the final hearing and I approve that plan. I would invite the parties to agree a timetable through to final hearing for her including the filing of all necessary evidence.  Public funding directions 56.    Finally I make a public funding direction in respect of the public funding certificates for W, X and Z.

(APPROVED) JUDGMENT








 

 

 

Judgment Re B
(A Child)

 

1.����� The
court is concerned with a child �B� whose date of birth is 24th March 2013 and
it is his welfare that is the court�s paramount consideration.� He is
represented in these proceedings through his guardian, by Malek Wan Daud of
Counsel.

 

2.����� B�s
mother �D� is 19 years old.� She is represented by leading and junior Counsel,
Leslie Samuels QC and Abigail Turner instructed by BLM Solicitors. 

 

3.����� B�s
father is �T� who is 20 years of age.�� He is represented by leading and junior
Counsel, Francis Judd QC and Simon Miller instructed by Wilsons Solicitors.� 

 

4.����� The
Local Authority is represented by Giles Bain of Counsel.

 

5.����� On
2nd August 2013 the Local Authority issued an application for a care order and
interim care order in respect of B and the proceedings have continued since
that time.� This was originally a threshold and fact finding hearing to
determine whether B�s admission to Hospital on the 22 May with bleeding in his
brain was caused by an accidental or natural process, unknown aetiology or
non-accidental cause; or whether it was a deliberate infliction by shaking and
if so, on how many occasions.� If the injuries sustained by B were found to
have been a non-accidental head injury (NAHI) the court would have had to
consider identification of a perpetrator or perpetrators.� At the conclusion of
the live evidence the Local Authority indicated that it no longer sought
findings of NAHI but pursued findings relating to domestic abuse and the
volatility and instability of the parents relationship and its impact on B.�
The parents have accepted that the Threshold Criteria under s31 of the Children
Act has been crossed but there has been a dispute on the factual basis and the
findings made by the court have been directed to the amended draft findings now
sought by the Local Authority. 

 

6.����� There
has been a lengthy forensic process comprising of seven days of oral evidence,
followed by submissions and a wealth of complex and often conflicting medical
evidence and research material; notwithstanding the Local Authority�s revised
position, it is clearly still a matter of importance that the issues in the
case are ventilated in this judgment given the public debate about �shaken baby
cases.� 

 

Progress of the proceedings

7.������ On 16th August 2013,
the proceedings came before Mr Recorder Goodwin, who made extensive case
management directions, including the making of an interim care order in respect
of B, which has been renewed periodically to date. Permission was given for the
parties to jointly instruct Dr Alan Sprigg (Consultant Paediatric Radiologist)
and Mr Elston (Consultant Paediatric Ophthalmic Surgeon). Full timetabling was
agreed, with a 10-day fact finding hearing fixed for 6th January
2014 and 5 day welfare hearing on 17th March 2014.

�

8.������ B was placed in foster care on
30th May 2013 and has remained settled in placement to date.�
Contact was arranged to take place three times per week, with each parent,
supervised.

 

9.������ The proceedings came before me
on 29th August 2013, when further extensive case management
directions were approved. Permission was given for the parties to jointly
instruct Professor John Wyatt (Emeritus Professor of Neonatal Paediatrics).

 

10.���� The proceedings came before me
again on 26th September 2013, when
further case management directions were made, including permission being given
to the Local Authority to seek disclosure of voice calls for specified periods
(15th April 2013 � 3rd June 2013 and 16th
August 2013 � 26th September 2013), between the mother and father. 

 

11.���� Further case management orders
were made on 23rd October 2013 and 22nd November 2013 and
an Issues Resolution Hearing on 16th December 2013. 

 

12.���� On 16th December
2013, the father was given permission to instruct a psychologist for the
purposes of a cognitive assessment being completed.� The father failed to
attend a scheduled appointment on 23rd December 2013 with Dr Keene.�
His representatives however are clear that there are no capacity issues and
every allowance was made in the hearing for any perceived learning difficulties.

 

Relevant
background & chronology

13.��� The
first respondent mother, D, was born on 22nd February 1994 and is therefore 19
years old and the second respondent father, T , was born on 23rd August 1993 is
therefore 20 years old.� 

 

14.��� B
was born on 24th March 2013 and is approximately 9 months old.� There was no
evidence of any significant problem in fetal health and development prior to
delivery.� He was born by a Neville Barnes forceps delivery at 12 noon on 24th
March 2013 and the forceps delivery appears to have been straightforward and
uncomplicated according to the record.� Also of significance is the fact that
there were no concerns about B�s behaviour expressed by health professionals in
the first hours and days of life.� 

 

15.��� B
was seen by a health visitor on 8th April 2013 when good weight gain was
recorded and no concerns expressed by either parent or any other healthcare
professional. 

 

16.��� On
18th April there was an alleged incident of domestic abuse when it seems the
mother telephoned police, when she was residing with her parents when father
arrived at the address, tried to get in and was not allowed entry.� On 25th
April 2013, or thereabouts, B was admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital with a
history of vomiting and a single episode of loose stools and was discharged
after appearing well on 30th April into the care of his parents.

 

17.��� It
seems that there was another domestic incident on 1st May when this time father
was the reporter of a domestic incident involving an argument between mother
and father relating to the care of their child which involved other family
members and the police took steps to take the child to a suitable carer for the
night (the maternal grandparents).� Police reported that the matter had been
�fuelled by alcohol,� an issue denied by parents.� There is little doubt that
there was a family argument.

 

18.��� On
22nd May the mother made a 111 call as she was concerned about B�s health.� The
log makes it clear that she was concerned about B being �a bit unresponsive�
and �projectile vomiting.�� She said his skin was clammy.� She said that about
six o�clock that evening B went really floppy and unresponsive and was given
certain advice.

 

19.��� The
very next day, namely 23rd May, mother made a 999 call reporting concerns with
her eight week old baby, rehearsing her concerns of the previous day and
reporting that B had started to go unresponsive that morning.� She said that he
had been sick and the individual that took the call could hear screaming.� B
was admitted to Stoke Mandeville Hospital.� Some time after admission a bruise
over the left hip was noted.

 

20.��� On
24th May post admission a number of tests and investigations were carried out
including a CT scan which indicated bilateral subdural haemorrhigic effusions
and a small frontal subcortical haemorrhage comprising what was believed to be
acute and chronic subdural haemorrhages.� An ophthalmological examination also
recorded retinal haemorrhages on the left side and B was transferred to the
neurosurgical unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.� 

 

21.��� On
examination in Oxford bruises were noted on the medial aspect of the right
upper arm and posterolateral aspect of the left arm and on the left flank.� No
bruises were found on initial admission and it possible that bruising can have
been caused by blood tests and/or the lumbar puncture respectively.�
Additionally, two blot haemorrhages were identified in B�s right retina.

 

22.��� B
was transferred back to Stoke Mandeville Hospital on 26th May.

 

23.��� On
28th May one symptom of pink bruises were present on the anterior aspect of
both upper arms and a one centimetre bruise overlying the left hip and I have
already mentioned the possibility of causation by medical procedures, a
possibility accepted by the medical health professionals.� On 30th May a
further ophthalmological examination showed a number of retinal haemorrhages
now in the left eye, those in the right eye having apparently resolved.� I
record also that various medical tests were completed including a skeletal survey,
which was normal.� Clotting studies were carried out and were expressed to be
within normal limits, there was no evidence of congenital metabolic abnormality
or rare congenital clotting abnormalities.� No explanation was given to
hospital staff for B�s presentation by either parent and on 30th or 31st May B
was discharged from hospital into the care of the Local Authority.

 

24.��� It
appears that there was another domestic incident involving the parents on 31st
May which I come to in due course.

 

25.��� The
parents were interviewed by police on 5th June in relation to suspected
non-accidental injury.

 

26.��� On
9th September the father assaulted the mother, was convicted of common assault
and fined. There appears to have been another incident on the 25th
September involving a degree of domestic abuse.

 

27.��� An
application was issued by the Local Authority on 2nd August.� During the course
of proceedings Dr A Sprigg, consultant neuro-radiologist, Mr John S Elston,
consultant ophthalmic surgeon and Professor Wyatt, consultant paediatric
neonatologist considered the radiological ophthalmological and clinical
findings. In an experts� meeting there appeared to be a consensus, that events
immediately prior to the admission of the 22 May were highly significant and
all then believed that B had suffered a recent event a matter of minutes or
hours before his deterioration but none could exclude a previous process that
had been going on from birth or from some other undisclosed traumatic event� at
some time previously. Suffice it to say that this view unraveled to a marked
degree during their oral evidence when the views expressed became increasingly
tentative during lengthy cross examination. 

 

28.��� I
now turn to a brief summary of that written medical evidence as it was at the
start of the hearing to set the scene which I have drawn from the Local
Authority�s helpful opening notes; insofar as there is any conflict in that
summary with any of my subsequent findings, my findings of course prevail, as I
have heard from the key medical witnesses in oral evidence.� In any event
findings are not pursued by the Local Authority on the issue of NAHI but it is
nevertheless important the available evidence is evaluated so that the Court
can be satisfied that the stance taken by the Local Authority is correct in all
the circumstances of this case.

 

The Medical Evidence

The lead treating clinician

29.���� On admission on 23rd
May 2013, B�s care was managed between two hospitals and overseen by Dr
Beneera Shrestha (Consultant Paediatrician).� She was of
the view that the subdural haemorrhage was suggestive of NAHI pending further
investigations. 

 

 

 

The report of Mr John Elston � Consultant
Ophthalmic Surgeon 03.09.13

30.���� He focused on the retinal
examinations of B carried out on 24.05.13, 25.05.13 and 30.05.13.� He confirms:
�the documentation in the notes of the presence of retinal haemorrhages is
somewhat problematic and contradictory� and goes on to conclude: 

�The possible causes to be considered in
this case for the retinal haemorrhages are: 

a)    
Inflicted
trauma. This could account for the haemorrhages documented on 25.05.13 and
would correlate the finding of acute on chronic haemorrhage and a presentation
with intermittent floppy episodes two to three days earlier. No other cause was
found for this illness. 

b)   
Naturally
occurring illnesses or disorders. No naturally occurring illness such as acute
overwhelming infection, acute leukaemia or other blood clotting disorder was
identified which could have caused the retinal haemorrhages documented.

c)    
Unknown
cause. I cannot identify a definite cause for the retinal haemorrhages
documented in the left eye as present on 30.05.13.�

�

The report of Dr Alan Sprigg
�
Consultant Paediatric Radiologist 06.10.13

31.���� Dr Sprigg reviewed the imaging,
in particular the CT scan carried out on 24.05.13, MRI on 25.05.13 and MRI on
11.06.13. He identified this as a complex case that required multiple expert
input.�� His opinion included the following: �The neuro-radiology is complex. I
defer on the issues of clinical neurology.� The first CT scan shows bilateral
symmetrical subdural haematomas. This is a mixture of recent bleeding and
fluid. The fluid could be EITHER a traumatic effusion (=recent injury) OR old
chronic subdural haematomas (=weeks old and could theroretically date back to
birth)....Radiologically the evidence for acute effusions vs chronic subdural
haematomas is finely balanced in this case.�

 

The report of Professor John S. Wyatt �
Consultant Neonatologist 31.10.13 

32.���� Professor Wyatt was instructed
to provide an opinion in respect of the causation and consequences of foetal,
perinatal and neonatal injury.� He concludes: �the forceps delivery appears to
have been straightforward and uncomplicated.�� He identifies this case at
paragraph 101 of his report as �...an unusual and complex case and that the
available medical evidence about the causation of B�s injuries is not entirely
consistent or conclusive.�� Again at paragraph 102, he says �The subdural
haemorrhages and residual collections may have been caused by one or more
episodes of undisclosed non-accidental head injury.� One episode of
non-accidental heard injury may have occurred at an undisclosed time early on
in B�s life, leading to acute subdural haemorrhage and the subsequent
development of subdural collections.� A second episode of non-accidental head
injury may have occurred on 22 May leading to the sudden deterioration in B�s
behaviour and the development of seizures and encephalopathy.�

�

33.���� At� paragraph 103 he says,
�Alternatively it is possible that B developed asymptomatic subdural
haemorrhages due to natural causes at birth and that these led to persistent
and slowly accumulating subdural collections.� In this case the sudden
deterioration on 22 May leading to seizures and encephalopathy is unexplained.�

 

Experts meeting

5th November 2013 

34.���� Whilst it has not proved
possible it seems� to summarise the areas of agreement and disagreement from
this meeting, it would appear that there was agreement at that stage there had
been a recent event, with Professor Wyatt identifying the clinical presentation
on 22nd May 2013 as being important.

 

35.���� Following the hearing on 16th
December 2013, permission was given for additional questions to be asked of the
medical experts, and I have read the responses that have been filed.� The
relevant issues I rehearse in my review of the oral evidence later in this
judgment. 

 

Medical tests

36.���� Recent blood tests have been
completed in respect of B in connection with a further extended clotting study
and test for Glutaric aciduria. One test, acetyl carnitine, was not taken due
to the level of distress B was under having had 8 sample of blood taken.�
Professor Wyatt has confirmed that he does consider any further blood tests to
be justified. 

 

 

 

Bruising

37.���� On 16th December
2013, the court directed the Local Authority to clarify its position in respect
of bruising recorded to have been seen on B during his admission to hospital
from 23rd May 2013. The Local Authority takes note of the
alternative aetiology for this bruising but still initially sought a finding in
relation to this matter, when set in the context of the wider forensic
examination of alleged non accidental injuries being suffered by B.� I have had
in mind other innocent possibilities arising out of medical treatment and have
been taken to the observations of the treating clinicians.

 

38.���� I
heard in oral evidence from the witnesses whose evidence is summarised below.

 

39.��� Dr
Alan Sprigg is a consultant paediatric radiologist who has
extensive court experience in relation to his area of special interest namely
paediatric neuro and skeletal imaging in suspected non-accidental injury
cases.� His extensive qualifications are set out in the preamble to his
report.� He is a jointly appointed expert in the case.

 

40.��� He
has extensively reviewed the available radiology in this case together with the
medical notes. 

 

41.��� His
written report makes it clear that the radiology is complex and I have already
rehearsed his comment that the fluid in the brain revealed by the radiology
could be either a traumatic effusion or old chronic haematoma, theoretically dating
back to birth.� He records that there was no evidence of impact injury at the
time of presentation.� There was no scalp swelling until after a later MRI scan
but this was after B�s skull had been tapped for fluid.� There was no evidence
of focal brain damage although B�s history could be interpreted as �fitting�
which implies a focal brain source. 

 

42.��� He
was clearly much exercised in relation to the evidence presented revealed acute
effusions or chronic subdural haematoma describing this aspect as �finely
balanced.�� He indicated that other factors could assist for example, an
examination of the head size, examination of the fluid drained from the brain
and the dating if possible of retinal haemorrhages. 

 

43.��� He
clearly found it significant that there was a small area of acute subarachnoid
haemorrhage on the initial CT scan and on the first MRI scan in an area where
there was no prior injury or fluid.� This indicated �a recent bleed.�� He
records that the ventricles and surface subarachnoid space was prominent on the
initial scan and that usually where there are large bilateral surface subdural
collections the subarachnoid space and ventricles show some degree of compression
but if anything, the reverse was true in B�s case on reviewing his scans.� He
was open to the possibility therefore that if the brain is freer to move inside
the skull then this may predispose to subdural haemorrhage with lesser force
than an average baby.� Set against that the vast majority of scans that are
performed on babies with a degree of disproportion do not show any subdural or
subarachnoid bleeding (old or new).� He opined that with a normal baby the
force would have to be significant and well beyond normal handling but if the
brain was smaller than normal then lesser force might be needed but this was
difficult to quantify.� The presence of large pre-existing chronic subdural
haemorrhage bleeding into the subdural place can occur with minimal force but
normally subarachnoid haemorrhage needs significant force.

 

44.��� He
was clear that in relation to the possible causes of the neurological injuries
including (if applicable) any unknown cause required multi-disciplinary review
before coming to a definite conclusion.� It is not without significance that he
agreed with other experts that on the balance of probabilities there had been a
recent event, a matter of minutes or hours prior to B�s deterioration on 22nd
May.

 

45.��� I
have read his report with care together with his contribution to the experts�
meeting and replies to additional questions posed to him in correspondence.� By
the time he gave his oral evidence he had updated himself in relation to the
parties� position statements, the Local Authority�s opening document and the
research material that has been filed with the court.� When he came to give his
oral evidence he was taken to the experts� meeting when he indicated that the
first CT on 24th May showed evidence of definite recent bleeding in both the
subdural and subarachnoid space making it clear that only a very small amount
of subarachnoid haemorrhage was present over the right frontal lobe but he
nevertheless thought that that was significant. 

 

46.��� In
the subdural space he described higher density fluid and that this could be due
to two things.� Firstly, a chronic subdural that was weeks old if not longer theoretically
going back to birth mixed up with acute blood.� The other explanation which it
is clear he found to be finely balanced and which he described as �equally
viable� is that all the findings are recent and the presentation was one of
acute blood which he described as �white mixed up with acute effusions which
are black giving a grey picture.�� So in short form it was his view that there
were two possible explanations.� One was as a recent bleed plus an old bleed;
the other explanation denotes just a recent injury only.� 

 

47.��� The
finding of subarachnoid haemorrhage was in an area that there cannot have been
old bleeding. It emerged more clearly in his oral evidence that he also set
some store by the CT finding on 26th May that �there is a thin posterior fossa
subdural collection best appreciated on the sagital images (T1 hyper/T2 lsc -
hyper).�� He described this as �acute blood in the cerebellum where there was
no chronic collection and would be dated in the same date range as the deposit
of acute subarachnoid blood i.e. 3 to 7 days.� He clearly found it significant
that there was no chronic collection suggested in that area and although he
accepted that it was possible that acute blood (possibly caused by re-bleeding)
can move to another area he clearly thought it unlikely it being more likely
that chronic blood would move rather than acute blood because of its density
and consistency.� This particular collection in the posterior fossa he
described as more symptomatic of a recent injury.� He said that acute blood
around the cerebellum could support a recent injury.

 

48.��� Matters
have been made more difficult in this case because of the lack of head
circumference measurements from birth until admission in order to track
enlargement of the skull giving support for the possibility of birth induced
haematoma and the fact that the radiology in the second MRI scan had been
compromised by the clinical decision for B�s head to be tapped some thirteen or
so hours before that scan.

 

49.��� He
was open to the possibility that re-bleeding could occur into the subdural
space and this could occur if the membranes crossing the subdural space bled and
this bleeding could be caused by either minor trauma or be asymptomatic.

 

50.��� However
it was his view that acute effusions do not re-bleed and he was resistant to
the notion, although did not exclude it as a possibility, that the same process
could not occur in the subarachnoid space.� It was clear that he thought it
unlikely.

 

51.��� In
a normal infant force outside reasonable handling would be required to cause a
bleed in the subarachnoid space and any recent bleed was more likely to be due
to shaking as there was no evidence to suggest impact.� His view at the
experts� meeting was that if there had been a recent episode the most likely
explanation for that would be forcible shaking by way of traumatic injury which
would explain the subarachnoid bleed.� It could also explain the subdural fluid
and it was not possible to exclude one event as having caused the bleed at the
back of the head and the subarachnoid bleed all in the presence of an old
subdural haematoma.

 

52.��� He
agreed that the court was dealing with a complex case that required multiple
expertise.� The missing head size measurements and the fact that there could
have been a scan before tapping were not helpful, neither would it seem was the
absence of evidence from a neuro surgeon.

 

53.��� So
far as head measurements were concerned, as far as he was concerned at birth B�s
head size was in proportion to his body weight but there had been an increase
on admission to the 91st centile.� He maintained that head size could go up
quite quickly after acute effusion and would continue to rise after tapping.�
It was possible after one traumatic event for the head size to continue to
increase and a small proportion of children fell into that category.

 

54.��� He
was plainly well aware of the competing research in relation to the contentious
area of the causation of subdural haematoma in neonatal children.� He accepted,
and this was a measure of his balance, that the position changes as the
frontiers of science advance.

 

55.��� He
was open to the possibility that B could have had an acute haemorrhage at birth
and this could explain B�s subsequent chronic subdural bleed.� He couldn�t say
without head measurements taken in the intervening period � a missing piece of
the jigsaw.� He accepted in evidence, as he did in his written evidence, that
re-bleeding can occur after little or no trauma in relation to subdural
haematoma.� 

 

56.��� He
accepted that B has a larger subarachnoid space and Tretically he could have a
predisposition to bleed with no or very little trauma but he emphasised that
this is not something that he has seen in his career and there was no research
to deal with this particular point.

 

57.��� He
stood by the observations that he had made in the experts� meeting that if B
had suffered a traumatic injury due to shaking the person with him at the time
would have recognised that their handling was inappropriate but they may not
have realised that they caused any bleeding inside his head.� For someone who
had not actually witnessed the event they may find it as fairly non-specific
presentation such as vomiting, drowsy and the type of presentation that was
recorded on the mother�s 111 call.� Calling the 111 number would be a
reasonable response given that presentation.

 

58.��� He
was clear throughout all his evidence in relation to the possibility of
re-bleeding in the subdural space because of the stretching of veins and/or
membranes over an enlarged space but was resistant to the notion that the same
would equally apply in relation to the subarachnoid space.� Equally he accepted
that bleeding in the subarachnoid space was not commonly seen in shaking
cases.� He also said, notwithstanding the research, that it was rare to find
acute subdural haematomas at birth grow into chronic subdural haematomas
subsequently.� Although he was open to the range of possibilities that were
suggested to him throughout his evidence he stood by his evidence that there
had been a recent traumatic event and this was based on his observation of the
subarachnoid haemorrhage and the presence of acute subdural blood in the
cerebellum on the CT scan that he reviewed.� I am mindful that his expertise is
necessarily limited to radiology and he expressly invited a multi disciplinary
approach.� However his opinion has been substantially weakened when considering
the evidence of the other experts, as my summary of their evidence indicates
and I was struck by his concession that it was not easy to fit all the pieces
of the jigsaw together and that there was a lot of missing information.

 

59.��� John
S Elston
is a consultant ophthalmic surgeon based at the John Radcliffe Hospital where
he specialises in paediatric and neuro ophthalmology.� He is an experienced
expert witness and has been jointly instructed by all the parties.� As part of
his brief he has reviewed the medical notes in relation to ophthalmology in
this case although has not examined B�s eyes or indeed seen photographs of
examinations carried out by others which is now often the case. 

 

60.��� His
report deals with an analysis of each of the ophthalmic examinations carried
out on B between 24th and 30th May 2013 of which there were four the last of
which were conducted by a Dr Burke and the consultant, Mr Benjamin, probably at
the same time with Mr Benjamin reviewing Dr Burke�s findings.� 

 

61.��� A
senior house officer, namely Dr Harvey, at 12pm on 24th May identified a red
area in the medial corner of the right eye.� The pupil responses were recorded
to be normal.

 

62.��� The
second examination took place later the same day but the examining doctor has
not been identified and the small pink patch noted earlier was not documented.�
It was the first retinal examination.

 

63.��� A
retinal examination took place after it is assumed dilation of the pupils with
drops although this is not documented.� Apparently the examination was
difficult and no speculum was available.� There was an indication that there
might be a retinal haemorrhage in both eyes in the temple periphery but Mr
Elston did not think much reliance can be placed on the results of this
examination as he has questioned the methodology of the examiner and only a
limited view was obtained. 

 

64.��� A
second retinal examination took place at the John Radcliffe Hospital after B
was transferred on 25th May by an experienced associate specialist, Moustafa
Issa.� Two blot haemorrhages were revealed in the right eye inferior to the
optic disc and no abnormalities were documented in the left eye and Mr Elston
regarded this examination as being likely to have documented the true state of
retina in both eyes on this occasion.

 

65.��� The
third retinal examination (and the fourth observation of B�s eyes) took place
again at Stoke Mandeville Hospital this time on 30th May and was carried out by
a trainee ophthalmologist who documented dilating the pupils and the use of an
indirect ophthalmoscope.� Perversely perhaps no retinal haemorrhages were seen
in the right eye, three in the left eye and these findings were confirmed by Mr
Benjamin, the experienced consultant ophthalmologist who agreed that there were
no retinal haemorrhages in the right eye but three in the left, two intra
retinal in the temporal retina above and below the vascular arcade and one at
the macular.

 

66.��� In
short form therefore there were three retinal examinations, four examinations
in all counting the last retinal examination by Dr Burke confirmed by Mr
Benjamin as one examination although there may well have been two on that
occasion.

 

67.��� Mr
Elston has described the presence of retinal haemorrhages as �somewhat
problematic and contradictory.�� He places reliance on the second and third
retinal examinations.� One revealing retinal haemorrhaging in the right eye
which had resolved by the time of the third examination which documented three
retinal haemorrhages in the left.

 

68.��� In
his report he says �it can be argued that the two retinal haemorrhages
documented on 25th May are compatible with there having been an episode of
non-accidental injury which led to the three floppy episodes on 22nd and 23rd
May, the acute haemorrhage superimposed on the chronic subdural effusions at
the admission to hospital.� These haemorrhages � would be compatible with the
natural history resolved spontaneously by the time of the examination on 30th
May.�� However he identifies that in accepting this hypothesis also means
accepting that the new retinal haemorrhages developed in the left eye between
25th May and 30th May while those in the right eye resolved.� It is that issue
that presents the conundrum in relation to this case which begs explanation,
one possible explanation being a sudden elevation of intra cranial pressure but
he was concerned that the notes revealed no clinical correlate of that
proposition.� B of course was in hospital during this period under close
supervision and there is nothing in the notes to suggest he was subjected to
any additional injury or untoward event.� 

 

69.��� Of
course he was aware of Dr Benjamin�s letter to Dr Shrestha indicating that it
was possible that the current haemorrhages (i.e. those revealed on 30th May)
were related to the recent surgery that B had if he had significant changes of
inter cranial pressure.� Mr Elston was troubled that there was no indication in
the notes that had happened that a neuro surgeon would be required to comment
it was likely that this had occurred but his view is that if it had been a
matter of concern the clinical notes would correlate.� 

 

70.��� It
seems clear from his report and oral evidence that although he was alive to
other causes of retinal haemorrhage none of these causes are indicated in the
documentation and had been actively excluded.

 

71.��� He
was asked to consider the possibility of retinal haemorrhages in a child that
had been delivered by forceps.� It is clear that he discounted forceps delivery
although recognising it as a recognised cause that these retinal haemorrhages
tend to resolve spontaneously by 16 days in the vast majority of cases.� He was
prepared to accept it only as a remote possibility.

 

72.��� One
possibility was that the haemorrhages discovered in the left eye had
spontaneously resolved and he was alive to the possibility of a rise in
inter-cranial pressure.� Certainly the rise in inter cranial pressure must have
been significant enough to justify the taps and Dr Issa�s examination came
twelve hours or so after the tap had been undertaken.

 

73.��� Matters
were further complicated by the different descriptions of the haemorrhages and
the fact that they were in different eyes and he clearly found the situation
perplexing and difficult.� This inevitably led to a discussion in his evidence
as to possible causes and an unknown cause could not be excluded.� A birth
related cause was only remotely possible for the haemorrhages on 25th May and
only if there was extensive haemorrhaging at birth.� 

 

74.��� As
to whether raised inter cranial pressure could be an explanation for the
haemorrhaging in both eyes, that would depend on whether there were a series of
fluctuations over the relevant period of time because the left haemorrhages
resolved five days later.

 

75.��� If
there had been a acute elevation of inter cranial pressure he would have
expected to have seen more evidence of retinal haemorrhages to compare more
closely with a case of abusive trauma and in this case he agreed with the
proposition that was put to him by the father�s Counsel, Miss Judd, that there
were extremely limited retinal haemorrhages at the lower end of the spectrum.� 

 

76.��� He
agreed that the conventional view of the cause of retinal haemorrhaging in
shaking cases was due to reduced drainage from the eyes combined with shearing
forces a mechanism wholly different from retinal haemorrhages occurring at
birth where the mechanism was higher pressure occasioned by the birth process
itself.

 

77.��� He
was open to the possibility that extra fluid in the brain could affect the
drainage from the eye and this could be transmitted to the optic nerve sheath
and there was potential for this to occur but of course this may be offset to
an extent by an increase in the head circumference.

 

78.��� If
there had been an acute elevation of cranial pressure the drainage from the
eyes becomes restricted but he said it was usually more extensive and would
depend very much on the rate of rise of the pressure.

 

79.��� It
was suggested to him that if the retinal haemorrhages recorded on 30th May were
of an unknown cause then surely it was more likely that the same would be the
case on 25th May and he agreed with this proposition provided that trauma had
not been indicated.

 

80.��� Taking
the retinal findings as a whole it was not possible for him to be dogmatic in
relation to the cause. In my judgment his evidence does not assist in any
conclusion that there has been inflicted trauma.� It goes further perhaps in
the light of his concession in cross examination that it was absolutely right
to consider unknown cause in this case.

 

81.��� He
accepted the proposition that it was right that he should take the views of
other professionals into consideration informing his view and was asked to
consider whether he thought the other experts had sufficiently taken into
consideration the difficulties that he had encountered in reaching any firm
conclusion in relation to their views as this does not appear to have been
canvassed in the experts� meeting.� He accepted that if the retinal
haemorrhages were of an unknown cause then that could be relevant to the
subdural findings.� He agreed that although he had made his position clear at
the experts� meeting an unknown cause does not appear to have been discussed. 

 

82.��� Professor
John Wyatt is a consultant neonatologist, a jointly appointed
expert in this case and his area of expertise is the causation and consequences
of fetal, perinatal and neonatal injury and the medical care of newborn
infants.� His extensive qualifications are set out in his report. 

 

83.��� He
has reviewed all the written material in relation to this case and has
concluded in his written evidence that this is an unusual and complex case and
that the evidence about the causation of the subdural collections is not
entirely consistent or conclusive.� He opines that the subdural haemorrhages
and residual collections may well have been caused by one or more episodes of
undisclosed non-accidental head injury with one episode of non-accidental head
injury having occurred at an unknown point early in B�s life leading to a
subdural haemorrhage and the subsequent development of subdural collections.� A
second episode of non-accidental head injury may have occurred on 22nd May and
this would explain the sudden deterioration in B�s behaviour.� 

 

84.��� Alternatively,
he reports that it was possible that B developed asymptomatic subdural
haemorrhages due to natural causes at birth and this led to persistent and
slowly accumulated subdural collections.� However in this eventuality the
sudden deterioration on 22nd May leading to seizures and encephalopathy is unexplained.

 

85.��� He
originally expressed the view that the bruising over B�s left hip was more
likely than not to be the result of non-accidental injury or rough and
inappropriate handling a position which I am bound to say he resiled somewhat
from in live evidence.� He said the bruising on the upper arms is of uncertain
significance and could have been either caused by non-accidental injury or
rough handling or accidentally following admission.� He defers to Mr Elston in
terms of the causation of the retinal haemorrhages and Dr Sprigg so far as the
radiology is concerned.

 

86.��� It
is plain from his report that a number of matters exercised him even at that
stage.� One was the apparently dramatic increase in B�s head circumference
which was on the 9th centile on 24th March and somewhere between the 91st and
98th centile on 24th May.� His investigations have, in my judgment, been
severely hampered by the absence of measurements of head circumference between
these two dates but he does indicate that it is most likely that the excessive
increase in head circumference was due to gradual accumulation in the size of
the subdural collections leading to a rise in inter cranial pressure.� There is
a suggestion that the rise in inter cranial pressure may have resulted in the
episode of vomiting (diagnosed as gastroenteritis) which occurred in the period
between 26th and 30th April for which he was hospitalised.

 

87.��� He
records that from discharge in hospital in June 2013 B�s head circumference has
continued to increase suggesting that the subdural collections have persisted
and may have increased in size.

 

88.��� There
is no positive evidence of congenital metabolic disorder, no imaging evidence
of brain shrinkage and B�s clinical presentation and subsequent progress was
not at all characteristic of any congenital metabolic disorder and significant
the range of testing carried out on B during his admission at hospital
indicates no organic cause as was evident from his replies to supplementary
questions.

 

89.��� When
he came to give his oral evidence he was questioned on the likely causation of
the chronic subdural haematoma.� He stood by his written evidence and his
observations at the experts� meeting that a birth related cause was possible
but unlikely accepting as he did that the matter was finely balanced and would
have been assisted by head circumference measurements in the period following
birth including the admission into hospital in April.� He reminded the court
that a natural process at birth was a possible explanation as appears to have
been revealed by research in an increasingly significant proportion but was
inconsistent with other evidence and it was his view that B�s sudden
deterioration before his admission on 23rd May suggested some acute event.

 

90.��� As
to the lack of head circumference measurements, he indicated that this was
missing information but was not perhaps of vital significance and it was still
possible to give an opinion based on the other information putting together the
pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.� He accepted that some pieces in that puzzle had
more or greater significance and if it was right that the evidence in relation
to the retinal haemorrhages should be put to one side given Mr Elston�s
difficulty in forming a diagnosis, then that would alter the overall picture.

 

91.��� He
was reminded that Dr Sprigg had identified a second area of acute bleed around
the cerebellum and over the right side of the tentorium and he agreed that this
had not been discussed at the experts� meeting.� As to timing, he deferred to
Dr Sprigg and said that if it was fresh blood and not related to the chronic
subdural collections, and more likely to be recent it would strengthen the
proposition of a fresh area of trauma a few days before admission.� It would
not however rule out the proposition that the chronic collections could be
birth related.

 

92.��� He
acknowledged the research and the evolving state of knowledge and acknowledged
that a significant proportion of otherwise healthy babies were found to have
thin film subdural haematoma (often bilateral) from birth.� A small and
significant proportion of these children go on to form chronic collections but
if this was happening on any significant scale it would be revealed by routine
scans of radiologists up and down the country.� He obviously had an eye to the
research material that was put to him but said that there was a lack of
statistical power as these were very small studies.� He calculated that there
were 700,000 births a year in the country and even if subdural haematoma at birth
accounted for 1%, that would amount to 7,000 babies in the community and those
numbers were not seen in routine clinical examinations and therefore the
phenomena could not be common otherwise would be seen. 

 

93.��� Returning
to B�s delivery, in this case he said that B was in good condition at birth and
remained so for the first few days of his life and bruising and marks as a
consequence of forceps delivery was not unusual and there was no evidence of
damage to the brain; nor was he troubled it would seem by the length of the
labour which he described as being within normal limits for a first birth. 

 

94.��� He
could not exclude the possibility of a traumatic event after B first went home
but B�s behaviour was apparently reported to be normal and he was thriving.� He
was fundamentally well and healthy and there were no professional concerns.� A
feature in this case has been B�s admission to hospital in April where the
diagnosis was gastroenteritis.� He deals with this aspect in his report when he
states that the commonest cause for acute onset of vomiting in young babies is
viral gastroenteritis.� However it was unusual that there was no elevated
temperature and the blood pressure was noted to be elevated which was unusual
in gastroenteritis.� An alternative cause for the vomiting was raised inter
cranial pressure secondary to subdural haemorrhage.� This would explain the
lack of temperature elevation, the lack of diarrhoea (which in oral evidence he
thought was especially significant) and the raised blood pressure.� It would
also explain the unusually low haemoglobin concentration that was recorded at
that time.� He said �however if the cause of the vomiting episode was raised
inter cranial pressure it would be unusual that no other neurological
abnormalities were noted.�� It is clear from looking at the medical notes that
none were even considered and it is a significant gap in the evidence.� I note
in any event that B�s head was not measured and certainly a rise in inter
cranial pressure at this juncture certainly would have been informed by a
measurement of the head circumference.� The upshot of this differential
diagnosis was that he felt unable to come down on one side or the other and
said that much would depend on what the court made of the evidence in relation
to the events immediately preceding 22nd May.

 

95.��� He
ascribed little or no significance to mother�s report of the Tesco incident a
week after B�s birth when described him as being bubble and dazed or indeed his
recorded breath holding on 15th August when he was in foster care.

 

96.��� I
indicated earlier that he seemed less willing to attribute any great
significance to the bruise after being reminded that there was no bruising
recorded on admission and the notes indicated that Dr Mandava and the relevant
senior nurse felt that the small bruise on B�s hip might have been caused
during the lumbar puncture procedure and the bruise to the arms may well be due
to pressure from the blood taking particularly as the right arm was held
tightly and he was open to the suggestion that inadvertent and excessive force
could have been used.� 

 

97.��� It
became apparent through cross examination that the April admission troubled him
because of the lack of data.� If it was related to subdural haemorrhages then
these could be birth related but the accumulation was likely to be slow rather
than a sudden event as occurred in May and this dramatic change he described as
an important element in determining whether there had been a recent traumatic
event.� 

 

98.��� The
sudden change of B�s behaviour, the presence of acute fresh blood, and the
retinal images (of whatever provenance I suspect) were difficult to explain by
birth related events, but remain unexplained.

 

99.��� Crucially
perhaps if there had been a continued and slow accumulation which involved
hospital admission in April he would have expected it to continue from April to
23rd May although it may be significant that B does not appear to have been
reviewed by health professionals in that period.� A sticking point to this
particular case also seemed to be that B got better after the April admission
and then acutely unwell very rapidly towards the end of May and he continued to
find that difficult to trace that back to a birth event.

 

100.� He
acknowledged of course that any process of re-bleed could cause the symptoms
and there could be slow accumulations thereafter and a gradual process was
certainly possible that is to say, of slowly accumulating effusions.� It was
possible that re-bleed could occur and not be seen if for example, there was a
seizure but he thought that that would come apparent in a non specific way in
terms of B being off colour, poor feeding.� However he accepted that general
practitioners may not pick this up or inexperienced parents.� He was dismissive
of a notion that some sort of apnoeic attack could be linked to the
subarachnoid bleeding as this was more usual in cases of prolonged hypoxia and
there would be normally an identifiable event and therefore he thought this
scenario was pretty unlikely.� The fresh subarachnoid bleeding (albeit �tiny�)
was a piece of the jigsaw.

 

101.� A
dramatic increase in head size could be a feature against a view that it was a
single incident on 22nd May but a rapid rise over a 24 hour period in hospital
was possible against the background of an acute event.

 

102.� He
was taken to that part of his evidence that dealt with B�s prognosis and he
recorded that it seemed likely that B has persistent subdural collections which
are leading to the increased head circumference.� He said in his report �it is
possible that the subdural collections will continue to enlarge in the future
leading to raised intracranial pressure and the risk of neurological injury.��
He emphasised the need for regular review and said in oral evidence that it appears
that B has continued to have a significantly enlarged head and this was an
unusual feature but a small and significant number will have persistent
collections and this includes the potential for re-bleeding and raised inter
cranial pressure.

 

103.� He
accepted, in the above context looking back to examine whether the subdurals�
were birth related and as to whether this was a condition that existed from
birth from some undiagnosed cause.� He said the difficulty with that position
was the very rapid rise in the head circumference in May. 

 

104.� As
to the progression and enlargement of the subdural collections, he said that it
was perfectly possible to have a small but significant amount of blood without
significant signs and he agreed that a consequence of that will be re-bleeding
after minor trauma so far as the subdural haematoma were concerned leading to
fresh blood and a new stimulus for accumulation of fluid.

 

105.� He
agreed that chronic subdural haematoma are variable and can present in unusual
ways the suggestion being that there was a tipping point of some sort in April
and a further more tipping point in May without the infliction of trauma and
certainly he appeared troubled that if indeed B�s presentation was caused by
one traumatic event it was at the lower end of the scale and significant that
there was no permanent brain tissue injury as is more commonly observed in
these cases.

 

106.� It
was more common for the baby to stop breathing and if the court accepts the 111
call and the 999 call by the mother as accurate, it is not a typical pattern in
a shaken baby case.

 

107.� He
acknowledged, when taken to it, that the subarachnoid bleeding was described as
�tiny� and the acute bleeding in the cerebellum was �small� and he appeared to
accept� as a possibility in the context of subdural haematoma that the bleeding
occurring in one place in the skull could appear in another hemisphere because
of the fluidity and interaction of the various membranes in the brain.� He was
less disposed to consider that possible in the case of a bleed in the
sub-arachnoid space but could not discount it as a possibility.

 

108.� At
the conclusion of his evidence and the provenance of his paediatric overview,
the court was struck by the range of conflicting issues in this case and the
differential diagnoses from an expert of his undoubted calibre and experience.
His views became increasingly tentative as his oral evidence was progressed and
I detected that he became increasingly troubled by some of the complex features
in this case.� However in looking at the holistic picture his earlier concerns
regarding the bruising appeared to carry less weight, the retinal evidence is
to say the least troublesome, B�s admission to hospital in April was confined
to a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis that could have revealed vital
information as to the progression of head size and raised inter cranial
pressure, and the causation of the chronic subdural haematoma remained
substantially in doubt.

�


109.� Importantly
perhaps in the context of the alarming rise of B�s head circumference,
subsequent to his oral evidence he filed a head circumference chart in which he
plotted B�s head circumference measurements available at birth by interpolating
a straight line between that measurement at birth and the first measurement on
24th May and, subsequently post admission through to September and it is not
without significance that although his graph was not intended to imply that the
actual head circumference necessarily followed his interpolated line, the continuation
of head growth has tracked on steady and graduated increasing basis rather than
any supposed sharp increase immediately prior to admission on 23rd May. It is a
worrying feature and potentially goes to the proposition that B�s injuries were
due to some unknown cause.� His concession, in this unusual and complex case,
was that it was difficult to get all the pieces to fit together and as the
evidence was developing it was not getting any easier.� He was not in a
position to rule anything out.

 

110.� Dr
Baneera Shrestha is a consultant paediatrician who has
had overall responsibility for B�s care except of course when he was at the
John Radcliffe Hospital for brief period of time.� She continues to be
responsible for his care.� She last saw him at Christmas when he looked well
and happy but she reported that his development was a bit delayed.

 

111.� She
is the author of numerous entries in the medical notes and prepared a medical
report on B on 28th May in which she highlighted her concern following B�s
presentation with acute and chronic subdural haemorrhage and retinal
haemorrhages.� She took the view that B�s injuries were suspicious of
non-accidental injury (shaken baby syndrome) and I think it fair to say that it
was her medical concerns that largely led to the initiation of these
proceedings.

 

112.� Of
particular interest in relation to the fact finding exercise, she was taken to
a note that she had made in two parts on 24th May at 21.15 and continued it at
21.40.� She had earlier identified bruising on B�s body and knew that none had
been identified by Dr Mandava, the admitting officer.� She had made an enquiry
earlier in the day to Dr Mandava and recorded that Dr Mandava and� �senior
nurse Chris� had felt it might have been caused during the lumbar puncture
procedure.� She made enquiry about that because she took the view that any
bruising on a child particularly in these circumstances with an unexplained
head injury was a serious matter.

 

113.� Dr
Mandava had told her that she had been too busy to notice whether there were
any bruises as she was too busy trying to treat the baby.� She had also asked
the parents during the course of her interactions with them whether there had
been any incident of domestic violence or altercation between the parents (she
being concerned that B may have been caught accidentally in the crossfire) and
recorded that both parents said �no.�� Her own view seemed to be that bruising
caused by the lumbar puncture procedure would be unusual although she has
confirmed the view of the individuals who carried out that procedure that it
may well have been accidentally caused in that way. 

 

The
mother�s evidence

114.� D
is B�s mother and she gave evidence over the extent of an entire day on the
fifth day of the hearing.� She has filed four statements in the care
proceedings all of which I have read, given two statements to police dated 25th
September and 14th October respectively and was interviewed by police in
respect of which I have read the transcript dated 5th June. 

 

115.� The
most substantial change to her evidence was her current description of her
relationship with T from that which is contained in earlier statements and she
maintains that the true account is the one that she has filed shortly after the
commencement of this hearing.� She acknowledged that she minimised the state of
the violence and abusive relationship with the father because she still loved
the father and felt ashamed by the relationship acknowledging as she does now
that it wasn�t a healthy relationship and indeed was a controlling one.

 

116.� She
hid the true extent of the abusive relationship from her own mother because she
thought that her mother would think less of T as a person, an explanation I
found more difficult to understand.� What perhaps is more understandable in
terms of why she either lied or minimised the extent of the previous violence
was that she has remained in love with T and that is still her position
although she acknowledges that the relationship is over.

 

117.� The
second issue that she wished to correct when she gave her oral evidence in
chief was that it was wrong of her to have criticised the social worker as she
did in her first statement as she was in denial about the state of her
relationship with T.

 

118.� She
commented in relation to the father�s latest statement which he too has filed
during the currency of this hearing in which he sought to reply to her rather
clearer allegations and she maintained notwithstanding what he has written that
her account is true, acknowledging in the past that she has not been entirely
honest about the relationship.� She makes it plain in her statement that she
has come to realise the unhealthiness of her previous relationship because of
assistance from a one to one session with Women�s Aid in Aylesbury and being
able to reflect back in relation to the relationship.

 

119.� By
way of summary, she has explained the escalating violence that started before B
was conceived; it started with a forceful push and escalated into pulling hair
and slapping during arguments.� The slapping was a regular occurrence in some
weeks as much as once or twice a week and then there would be gap or so of may
be a week or two without any slapping.� She says in her statement �it became a
normal part of our relationship.�� 

 

120.� She
maintained that on another occasion she had been head butted and slapped and
this would have been sometime after B had been taken into care and before the
assault for which T was convicted on 9th September.

 

121.� It
is clear that she has cooperated with the Local Authority.� The contact notes
are positive in relation to her involvement with B.� She has been involved in
going to hospital with B with the foster carers when he has had tests and in
the period immediately after Christmas when B was in hospital for the entire
day having tests she and her mother and the foster carer all attended and she
played tribute to the good work done by the foster carer in relation to B.�
There are no problems between her and the foster carer and they both use the
contact book.

 

122.� She
acknowledges in relation to the father that she has never physically hurt the
father but has pushed him back after he has assaulted her.� Historically he has
always said that he was sorry and she would believe him and she was left
feeling that it was her fault.

 

123.� Her
written evidence deals with each of the allegations set out in the Scott
Schedule and notwithstanding her previous lack of honesty and candour in
relation to the extent of what was going on, her evidence had more than� the
ring of truth when it came down to dealing with elements of domestic violence.�
Her position has been given greater credibility, perhaps perversely, by the
fact that she has still maintained her love for T and acknowledged that they
were corresponding until two weeks ago on Facebook and she has not emotionally
separated from him, but still stands by her allegations. 

 

124.� Her
position in these proceedings is that she has never hurt B even by accident or
seen anyone else do it and given her present stance in relation to the
allegations of domestic violence against T, the fact that she stoutly maintains
that he would not harm B even by accident must carry some weight at least.

 

125.� Her
present position is that she is on antidepressants.� She has history of depression
but was taking two varieties of antidepressants after B was taken into care but
after 9th September.� She managed to come off Diazepam until the start of this
hearing but couldn�t sleep and has been re-prescribed.

 

126.� My
observation and assessment of the mother when she gave evidence, making every
allowance for how difficult that that must have been for her, was that she
presented as a vulnerable and very immature young woman who acts substantially
below her chronological age.� Her presentation is largely passive and she
appeared to have little recollection of substantially important events in the
short chronology of this case especially in so far as it impacted on her son.�
I had in mind her poor recollection of the events preceding B�s admission to
hospital on 25th April or thereabouts and her then current relationship with T
as well as of course her difficulty in remembering what was happening in her
relationship with T in the context of some rather ambiguous text messages that
were sent to her by him when B was in hospital in April.� I shall come to these
again presently in so far as it is possible to draw anything from them.� 

 

127.� When
cross examined by the Local Authority she was bound to accept that her previous
assertions regarding the state of the relationship between her and the father
amounted to significant and misleading lies the consequence of which is that
she has given a wrong and misleading impression and, amongst other things, cast
a shadow of blame over the social worker.

 

128.� She
accepted that she had lied to the medics and particularly Dr Shrestha when
asked a direct question about domestic violence.� She has lied to police to
whom she denied physical assaults and played down her concerns and understands
now how important it was to be truthful.

 

129.� It
is evident however she still has strong feelings for T who she still loves
despite the violence, control and intimidation that she alleges and, moreover,
the threats to her life.� Her position is that she does not feel threatened now
which of course gives rise to a substantial risk of resumption of that
relationship in some shape form or another as it is plain that she has not
emotionally separated from him. 

 

130.� She
was of course challenged that even in her latest statement she had not included
the allegation in August when she was sitting in a parked car in the garden
with the father when she was slapped across the head by him.� She recorded
feeling upset about this incident and had forgotten to mention it.� The
incident in itself is fairly trivial in as much as she tapped the father
playfully on the head because he was looking at some passing girls and he
slapped her back.� She denied that this was a hard slap on her part and said
that it was a harder slap on his.� It was, if I may say so, an indication of
the immature relationship between these two vulnerable parents and certainly
not as serious as some of the other allegations.

 

131.� She
was taken to an incident when she attended Accident & Emergency on 4th July
2012 with abdominal pain.� She was of course seven weeks pregnant with B at
that time and the notes make it clear that she had been hit in a scuffle.� Her
first reaction was to say that she couldn�t remember that incident but then
when reminded she recalled that it involved a fight between her brother and T
in the bedroom that she shared with T and she was stepped on while lying in
bed.� She had not mentioned this before because so far as she was concerned it
was between her brother and T but it was clearly an incident when her unborn
baby was put at risk in relation to some sort of violence altercation and
significant enough in normal circumstances for her to have recorded it.� She
said that it hadn�t come into her mind and I am sure that she is right about
that but there is still a substantial question mark in relation to this and in
her ability to identify what is serious and what could have the potential of
threatening her child (albeit unborn).� The Local Authority now also rely on an
incident on 31st May when she was pinned down on her bed by T and her father
had to intervene.� The consequence of that was that her father banned T from
the house.� The mother agreed that she had been held down.

 

132.� She
agreed that the father�s temper was unpredictable.� He would be fine and happy
one moment and then would �kick off.�� She agreed with the proposition that
there was no obvious trigger and that he could snap for no reason.

 

133.� She
agreed that she had been reluctant to leave B alone with the father.� She said
that she was afraid of his short fuse but didn�t, somewhat perversely perhaps,
believe that he would hurt B because he loves B.� It was suggested to her that
the father had told her on numerous occasions that he loved her but had
continued to hurt� her.� She accepted that proposition but maintained that T
wouldn�t do anymore than shout at B or indeed shout to another person if he
happened to be on the telephone when B was in his care and it is a significant
and enduring feature of her evidence that she has been consistent in her view
that the father would never hurt B.� I am bound to say that she found those
questions difficult to answer and agreed that her reluctance in those
circumstances to leave B with the father didn�t make much sense.� However on
the other hand given the escalation of her allegations regarding the father in
the very recent past there was of course an opportunity for her to give chapter
and verse on the father if she believed that he had genuinely hurt B either
accidentally or deliberately.

 

134.� In
terms of the father�s cannabis use, she maintained that after B�s birth the
father would smoke cannabis every three days and this would have a calming
effect on him.� She confirmed in oral evidence that he would become more
agitated after three days if he had not smoked cannabis and agreed with the
proposition that he would be �bouncing off the walls.�� He would behave in an
angrier way to her but not, she emphasised, to B.

 

135.� In
doing so of course she had to acknowledge that B was caught up in their verbal
arguments and sometimes was in the same room when there was a physical argument
but she has maintained throughout that B was not caught up in any accidental
violence between them.

 

136.� She
accepted that she�d had to go to her parents from time to time because of the
domestic violence because she felt safer both physically and emotionally with B
at their home and from time to time there would be split ups and then she would
return to the relationship.� 

 

137.� It
seems that certainly up until the end of December she has been in almost daily
communication with the father and this has subsisted from the end of
September.� They have not spoken about the case and she indicated that she
would be prepared to allow access to her Facebook.� She thinks this communication
stopped because the father is in another relationship but when she last
communicated with him she told him that she still cared for him although she
recognises in oral evidence that it is an unhealthy relationship.� In doing so
she has accepted that she has given an impression to the social worker that she
has not been communicating with T.� 

 

138.� Her
mobile phone was seized as part of the police investigation and examined for
text messages on 5th June 2013. 

 

139.� Lengthy
cross examination was conducted to ascertain whether the messages indicated
evidence of either parent�s knowledge of some cause of accident or inflicted
trauma in relation B revealed by exchanges between the parents.� The exercise
was necessarily limited by the fact that it is only the mother�s mobile phone
that was examined and the dangers of drawing inferences are clear in the
absence of the full context of exchange of messages from father�s phone.

 

140.� What
was revealed was considerable tension and difficulties in the relationship and
adolescent bickering.� The exercise was hampered by mother�s apparent lack of
recollection of the context and potential significance of a message and there
is little doubt that some of the messages were exchanged during the police
involvement but I am bound to say there is little evidentially that can be
drawn from most of them.� The mother�s invariable position was that she could
not remember the context of the vast majority of what was put her.� It is
unsurprising however that the Local Authority wanted to ascertain from the
mother her interpretation of certain key messages which had the potential of
significance.

 

141.� For
example, on 28th May, when B was in hospital, a message from father �it was an
accident.� Another enquiry received was from father on 25th May �wat ar the
feds sayin.� There may be a level of suspicion attached to these messages given
the chronology but nowhere could I detect evidence of the parents possessing
some guilty knowledge that would explain� B�s condition.

 

142.� In
the main there is little that can effectively be drawn from this information
other than evidence of threats by the parties against one another,
disagreements, curiosity about the police investigation and frustration from
mother about father not being at hospital when she clearly thought he should
have been.

 

143.� What
did emerge from mother�s evidence was the extent to which she went backwards
and forwards from her parents� house to father�s flat during the whole of the
period prior to B�s admission into hospital as the parties fell in and out of a
relationship.

 

144.� Mother
accepted in cross examination by father�s Counsel that B was in fact hardly
ever left alone with father and in any event she never saw father doing
anything of concern in relation to B.� Conversely however she didn�t want to
leave father alone with B because she was concerned about him shouting or not
paying proper attention.� She was not concerned about him hurting B.

 

145.� She
was not however was exaggerating her allegations against him and she maintained
her account and whatever uncertainties were indicated by her evidence as a
consequence of her lack of recollection, she impressed as a witness who was
clear, albeit late in the day, in relation to the scale of abuse and violence
that she had suffered from the father.� It was perhaps a measure of that
truthfulness that she was able to acknowledge in cross examination that the
relationship was volatile and there was an element of cat and mouse in relation
to the telephone exchanges when they would both not answer calls and then get
cross.� She was challenged that in fact the father had not slapped her on a
regular basis but she said that he had acknowledging that the slaps had not
caused marks or bruises and sometimes would� happen once or twice a week.� She
was challenged that she had exaggerated the car incident in August when she had
playfully slapped him and he had slapped her quite hard back, but maintained
her account.

 

146.� She
became upset when challenged that her account in relation to father head
butting her sometime after B had been taken into care was not true and she said
she was upset because the father was lying.� In short form she maintained the
truthfulness of her most recent account and it would certainly explain to a
great extent her various comings and goings from father�s flat to her parents�
property from B�s birth.

 

147.� Notwithstanding
the scale of what she alleges she still maintained that she would be happy for
the father to see B in some sort of contact if she were to resume care of him
and agreed with the account by the health visitor on 8th April that the health
visitor had observed good interaction between them.

 

148.� I
am bound to say that the health visitor records and some of the medical records
make interesting reading.� It seems that there was only one successful visit to
the young parents where no concerns were indicated with mother picking B up and
handling him appropriately and the parents cooperating. 

 

149.� However
a recommendation in relation to the mother attending a 12 week support group
was not taken up.� There were four failed hearing test appointments and,
crucially in the context of this case and the great gaps in relation to a
contemporaneous medical account insofar as what was happening in B�s life was concerned.�
On 9th May the mother did not attend for the 6 week post natal check up at the
GP�s surgery at which time there is little doubt that B would have been weighed
and examined quite thoroughly.

 

150.� A
picture, in my judgment, emerges from this evidence when coupled with the
evidence of mother moving backwards and forwards from the maternal
grandparent�s address and their flat, namely a complete lack of sensible and
responsible engagement with the health services against a background of the
mother�s preoccupation with maintaining her abusive� relationship with the
father to the obvious detriment of B.

 

151.� This
was laid bare in cross examination by the guardian�s Counsel and it was clear
from the mother�s replies that B�s interests were not always her first
consideration.� 

 

152.� One
such example of this is mother moving back into her parents� house on 16th
April, mother accepting father�s invitation in a text to return to the flat on
17th April, her travelling to the flat in a taxi with a three week old B to
spend the night.� She was not able to get into the flat so returning to her
parents� home and the father turning up outside her parents� home at 3 o�clock
in the morning of 18th April kicking the door when the police had to be
involved.� An ugly incident.

 

153.� Notwithstanding
all that, perversely she found it necessary to return to the father again on
22nd April and we know that within a matter of two or three days B had to be
admitted to hospital with repeat vomiting.

 

154.� Within
a short time of B�s discharge perhaps even the next day on 1st May B was
present during an argument between mother, father and father�s mother in which
father�s brother subsequently became involved and a shouting match ensured with
father and B upstairs in father�s flat and father�s brother outside
contributing to that argument.� As a consequence of this altercation which the
police described as alcohol fuelled, mother once again returned with a five
week old B to her parents� flat. 

 

155.� She
told the guardian�s Counsel in cross examination that that pattern continued
throughout April and indeed May.

 

156.� One
of the suggestions in this case is that B has had an abnormally large head for
some time and she recalled her father saying as much when B was admitted to
hospital in May.� It seems however that this was not mentioned to the health
visitor when she visited on 8th April and had the mother of course attended her
antenatal check on 9th May it is a matter that would have had the opportunity
of being raised.� 

 

157.� It
is her case that on one occasion after B�s removal but before the assault for
which the father was convicted on 9th September, she was assaulted by the
father who head butted her in bed and she received a black eye and a bruise on
her forehead.� She concealed this with make up.� After comparing her accounts
with the father�s accounts and hearing them both in evidence I have little
doubt that this is true.� The concerning feature in the context of this case is
not necessarily whether or not it happened, and in my judgment it did, but the
mother�s complete failure to mention this to the social worker with whom she
has a good relationship or indeed at contact.

 

158.� The
contact records are clear namely that the mother interacts appropriately with B
and meets his physical needs but she has demonstrated in the short time that B
was in her care that she has little aptitude for placing his needs ahead of her
own emotional need to remain in a destructive relationship with the father.�
The failed appointments tell their own story and it is perhaps unfortunate that
it is against that background that the court has been asked to consider whether
B has suffered inflicted injuries.

 

159.� S
is B�s maternal grandmother and she has made two statements within these
proceedings.

 

160.� The
first statement which she made with her husband, �A�, is dated 28th October and
in it she and her husband reposed the belief that B�s injuries were not
intentional and are directly connected to his forceps delivery at birth.� She
expressed the wish that B be returned to his mother and family by Christmas.�
In the intervening period it would seem that her husband has been convicted of
a charge of assault and is serving a period of imprisonment. 

 

161.� I
should add for the sake of completeness that she and A were subject to a
carer�s assessment and concerns raised in relation to A�s previous criminal
offences and domestic incidents involving their own relationship in 2004 and
2007 when A appears to have been in drink and assaulted S.� Incidentally when I
asked her in relation to that last incident she said she could not remember
it.� 

 

162.� Having
said all that I am prepared to accept evidence that S has tried to support her
daughter following B�s birth and continues to be a source of support to her as
her daughter is now living with her.

 

163.� She
runs her own small cleaning business and she would be prepared either to give
up work to care for B full time or work alongside her daughter and the father�s
aunt in effect to provide a package of care.� Her husband on release would live
elsewhere as she said �family comes first.�� Her last statement was filed in
the first days of this hearing and in summary she categorises the second
respondent father�s controlling behaviour towards her daughter and his verbal
abuse characterized , she would say, by the father being resistant to the
mother having pain relief in hospital during the course of B�s birth and then
being reluctant thereafter to allow family members to return to hold B.� 

 

164.� She
was aware of T�s abusive behaviour but did not, until recently, understand the
extent of the violence.

 

165.� She
expressed herself as being very positive that her daughter would not reunite
with T.� Since the separation her confidence had grown and expressed shock and
surprise when hearing in the witness box that the mother had indicated in
evidence that she still loved T after all that he had done.� Accordingly, there
must be a question over her own judgement and the extent to which she truly
knows her own daughter.

 

166.� She
also said that she didn�t think that her daughter had been in communication
with T since separation notwithstanding of course that her daughter gave
evidence that she had been in communication on Facebook as recently as
Christmas. 

 

167.� It
was difficult to reconcile her lack of knowledge of these key features or
indeed the extent to which her daughter had suffered violence at the hands of T
with her position that there were no secrets in her family which gives rise to
some concern as to what protective force she would be if charged with a
responsibility to care for B either on her own or with others.� I do not doubt
her good intention, I do doubt her effectiveness.

 

168.� It
seems that before B�s birth she had been concerned about the relationship
between the parents and said that the father was constantly phoning and texting
and she didn�t think this controlling aspect of the relationship was right.�
Her daughter appeared isolated from her friends.� Sometimes the calls would be
repeated up to fifteen or twenty times a day and she agreed with the suggestion
that T�s behaviour was obsessive, becoming worse when her daughter became
pregnant.

 

169.� She
was asked about the incident in her own house that led to the mother�s
admission to Accident & Emergency in 2012 when the mother was seven weeks
pregnant and had to be taken to casualty by police because of abdominal pain
having been caught in the crossfire of a fight between her son and the father.�
She said she hadn�t been able to establish exactly what had happened but knew
obviously that her daughter had to go to the Accident and Emergency
department.� Her state of� knowledge appeared scant.

 

170.� To
her substantial credit and the substantial credit of her husband, it seems it
was they that took the initiative in supplying the equipment necessary for B�s
arrival and had previously helped T fit out his flat.� She said �we provided
what they needed� and I am sure she is right.� I have little doubt that without
her involvement mother and father would have been singularly ill prepared. 

 

171.� She
knew that her daughter would be a good mother.� She said the father was very
excited about the baby but her concern was that he seemed to want a baby to
himself.� She agreed that the relationship between the parents� appeared
unstable with the mother (and in particular B) going backwards and forwards
from her house and the father�s flat.� She and her husband wanted her daughter
to come home initially for three or four days and she was therefore surprised
and disappointed that on the very first morning after their arrival they
decided to leave and we know from the chronology that mother went backwards and
forwards with B who was, at that stage, a very small baby indeed.

 

172.� She
was plainly also aware of the instability in the parents� relationship in April
and May but it remains a fact that she was unable to influence her daughter
sufficiently to stay in one place and she agreed that it was the police who had
returned B and the mother to her house following an argument between paternal
family members on 1st May.� She however did not think that B would not be
safe.� That is difficult to reconcile with even her scant recollection of the
July 2012 incident when the pregnant mother had to be checked out in Accident
and Emergency. 

 

173.� On
31st May she said that her husband had reported an incident whereby the father
was holding the mother down on a bed when they were staying overnight at their
house and that her daughter had been audibly upset.

 

174.� Against
the background of what she now knows of father�s volatility, his domestic
violence towards her daughter and his controlling and obsessive behaviour she
said that she would be very shocked if the father had done anything to hurt the
baby because both father and mother were very good with him and there was no
doubt that the father loved B and loved playing with him and talking to him as
well as interacting with him.� In fact she had no concerns as to his care, he
was really very good with B.� She had the impression that the parents shared
some of the feeds but that her daughter did most of the night feeds.

 

175.� She
was constrained to accept that the father kicked the door and caused a
disturbance in the early hours of 18th April and had seen the father getting
angry and aggressive in his speech and his behaviour was more angry than
agitated.

 

176.� Notwithstanding
all her concerns, it seems that she would not present any obstacles to the
father seeing his son.� I should record at this stage is that my impression of S
is that she is a hardworking mother and a devoted grandmother but I wonder to
what extent her safeguarding antenna were properly engaged in relation to this
case knowing that her grandson was exposed to such instability in the early
periods of his life.� 

 

177.� She
clearly didn�t know the number of missed health appointments.� She was taken to
a detailed chronology of B�s comings and goings from her house throughout April
and May and even against that background of frequent and constant contact with
the mother it is a source of grave concern that she apparently knew little of
the father�s behaviour towards her daughter and the extent to which necessarily
it would have exposed B to risk.

 

178.� It
will be part and parcel of any further assessment in the welfare stage that her
understanding of the risks of exposing B to volatility and domestic discord are
properly investigated as given that she has said that she has a close
relationship with her daughter, she was significantly badly informed in
relation to key elements of her daughter�s care of B in the first weeks of his
life.

 

Father�s
evidence

179.� T �is
B�s father and he has made five statements including his response to the
findings sought.� He was also interviewed by police and the transcript of the
interview that took place on 5th June is in the bundle.

 

180.� When
he gave his oral evidence in chief he went further than his written admissions
and admitting slapping the mother but was not specific in relation on how many
occasions that took place.� He admitted slapping the mother in the parked car�
in August and going round to the property in the early hours of 1st May.� His
other admissions are recorded in his last statement.� It was apparent however
that he took issue still with the extent of the mother�s allegations involving
him.

 

181.� He
explained that he had been very excited when he had learned of the mother�s
pregnancy and was overwhelmed.� He described it as �the best thing in the
world� when he first held B.� He explained that he had made improvements in his
life, was looking for work, had stopped smoking cannabis, was keeping fit by
going to the gym and was going to go to anger management to deal with �things.�

 

182.� He
accepted that he had gone over the top on a number of occasions saying a lot of
things he didn�t mean.� By way of example he acknowledged that he had behaved
in a wrong way to Dr Shrestha to whom he used abusive language on 30th May when
she explained that Social Services were coming to take B.� It may well be that
such language in the heat of the moment from a distressed parent is
understandable but that pattern of abusive and unpleasant behaviour is
replicated throughout the chronology of this case in father�s dealings with
social workers at contact particularly in the early days, other professionals,
the mother, his own family and the mother�s family and he presents throughout
the evidence as a man with poor self control and a propensity to act first and
think later.� I acknowledge of course that this may in some way be attributable
to his own background.� On his own admission he has learning difficulties and I
have been alive to any difficulty that he may have with the court process.

 

183.� In
view of his present position in that he acknowledges some incidents of violence
(although not all), in his earlier written statements when he says that there
were no incidents of physical violence between the mother and himself, it is of
course a lie as indeed was his assertion and that of the mother to Dr Shrestha
that there were no domestic violence elements in their relationship.

 

184.� His
case however is that he has separated from the mother and did so on 21st August
notwithstanding the fact that they had spent a night together at the end of
September.� On his case there has been very little communication between
himself and the mother and he has also been involved in a short relationship
which is now over as he wishes to focus on his son.� 

 

185.� Notwithstanding
what the mother has said about recent communication on Facebook, his case is
that he sent two messages on Facebook between 7th and 19th December basically
indicating that firstly he was not going to argue and secondly, that he wasn�t
going to have any communication because he had signed a document at the police
station and thought that he was bound by the terms of some injunction. When
Facebook records were disclosed it revealed that his recollection of those
limited exchanges was broadly correct.

 

186.� From
21st August (two days before his birthday so he remembers it distinctly) he
said that he and the mother thought that it was best to split up until
everything finishes.� After that matters if anything, got worse and we know
that on 9th September he assaulted the mother.

 

187.� He
said that he was upset by this separation.� He had in effect lost his family
and he has struggled with it and he understood that the mother had been advised
to separate and it had nothing to do with the way that he had behaved to her
and he did find it difficult to understand.� More than once he made it plain
that he still loved the mother and there was more than a hint that a
relationship at some unspecified time in the future could not be ruled out.� 

 

188.� His
justification for assaulting the mother on 9th September is a curious one and
contained in his October statement.� He said in that statement that he was
upset and this led to an argument with the mother after contact.� Leaving his
son after contact was very hard and he was under a lot of pressure and
emotional upset as a result of the case.� He said that he was sorry about the
loss of control but the mother was saying hurtful things to him about the
relationship and appeared to be playing games.� He was subsequently convicted
of common assault.� Of course I am mindful of the fact that this is not an
isolated incident and part of a continuing pattern of his relationship with the
mother which is made clear in the chronology. 

 

189.� He
resisted any notion that he had been slapping the mother sometimes as often as
once or twice a week but unable to proffer any real explanation as to why she
should be untruthful about that.� He accepted that he may have pulled her hair
�once or twice� as part of rough play or in a sexual context.� He denies any
suggestion that he head butted the mother.� One of his Tries?? was that she
somehow resented matters because he had �moved on.�

 

190.� Notwithstanding
his dispute with the mother regarding the factual aspects of the extent of
domestic violence, he still was at pains to describe the mother as �a perfect
mother� and his case was that B should be with his mother assisted by her own
mother.� 

 

191.� In
relation to possible re-ignition of his relationship with the mother, he was
challenged that in his October statement he indicated that he still loved the
mother and that she did not want to see him for reasons best known to herself.�
He wasn�t able to say why he had said that in his statement but indicated that
he did care for her, saying later in his oral evidence that he still loved her
and B but a relationship should not be in their heads for a year or two or
more.� He acknowledged that in effect he had been forced to separate.

 

192.� He
was challenged extensively on his inconsistencies regarding his cannabis use.� 

 

193.� In
oral evidence he claimed not to have used cannabis since late October/early
November 2013 but smoked one spliff over Christmas starting smoking cannabis in
July 2012 or thereabouts.� He denied any suggestion that he had ever smoked six
cannabis cigarettes a day.� At B�s birth he had one or two cannabis cigarettes
a week and there was no smoking in the house or in B�s presence.

 

194.� Of
course mother had previously said that he was smoking cannabis daily but had
cut down a bit after B�s birth.� In his later statement filed in the beginning
of these proceedings he indicated that he had stopped smoking cannabis before B
was born and when challenged with his latest oral account and that of the
mother, he said that stopping cannabis was a process and acknowledged that he
had not stopped completely.

 

195.� Earlier
in the proceedings and dated August 2013 he admitted smoking one spliff a day
and said that he used to smoke six spliffs a day something that he said he
never did when he gave his oral evidence.

 

196.� He
is plainly lying about the extent of his cannabis use.� He took issue with the
mother�s account that he needs cannabis to remain calm and did not accept that
he was less patient when he was not smoking cannabis.� He did acknowledge that
he didn�t just �care as much.�� His untruthful account in relation to his
cannabis use goes of course to his credibility and the extent to which he seeks
to minimise this use has a parallel, in my judgment, in relation to the extent
to which he seeks to minimise his abusive behaviour of the mother.�� He clearly
did not accept the suggestion that he has �a short fuse� and claimed not to
lose his temper quickly but the weight of the evidence is clearly against him.�
His suggestion that he gets �a bit agitated� is not borne out by examples of
his extreme volatile behaviour recorded in the contact notes when it is evident
that his behaviour was having a direct effect on B who was becoming upset and
agitated.

 

197.� Interestingly
in terms of his exchange with Dr Shrestha although he acknowledged that it was
wrong, he sought to justify it in terms of it being �not about losing my
temper� but about standing up for your family.� I detected more than once an
element of minimisation and justification in relation to his behaviour which
substantially undermines his acknowledgement and acceptance that others may feel
threatened.

 

198.� I
have already alluded to his behaviour in contact.� In fact it was the contact
on 7th August when father complains in an angry tone that the foster carer was
spoiling B and swore.� As I have said, B started to scream at one stage as the
father was getting more agitated.� He had complaints that the foster carer was
overfeeding B saying �she thinks she is his fucking mum.�� His voice was raised
and he was swearing to the extent that others in the community noticed what was
going on.� He referred to the foster carer as a �bitch� and said that he would
take a gun and shoot her to the extent that the threat was reported to the
police.� 

 

199.� He
admitted that what was reported was substantially true but thought to minimise
the threat element by indicating that there was nowhere that he could get a gun
and he seemed to find the incident amusing.� Incidentally there are numerous
references to text messages in this case and some of the messages to the mother
are threatening e.g. on 4th June �ok then if you wanna live� which the mother
took as a threat.� He accepted he was trying to get his own way but that
wouldn�t have been seen as a threat.� The words had gone out without him
thinking and he described it as an empty threat and that the mother knew that
it was.� At every question he sought to limit or modify the extent of his
behaviour and in any event said that his self control was now �a million times
better.�� 

 

200.� He
was resistant to the notion that his early hours visit to the maternal grandparents�
home at 3 o�clock in the morning of 18th April had been fuelled by anger and
that he was out of control notwithstanding the fact that the police had to be
called because he had been kicking at the door.

 

201.� He
did not accept any responsibility of the altercation with the mother�s brother
in July 2012 despite the fact that the mother was taken to hospital by police.�
He did not lose his self control he said �I didn�t do nothing.�

 

202.� It
was suggested that in July 2012 the police record indicated that he had been
involved in an assault on his own mother and had run off when police arrived
but was resistant to any notion that he was in possession of an imitation
firearm although acknowledged that he had at least one air rifle at the time.

 

203.� Most
surprisingly however was his assessment of his relationship with the mother
following B�s birth.� He explained his devastation at learning of the mother�s
infidelity a year previously from a friend but said that he forgave her.� He
also said that during their discussion about the matter he had pushed her and
she tumbled backwards.� After B�s birth and up to May 2013 his case was that
the relationship was getting stronger.� He just wanted to forget everyone else
and get on with their lives.� He felt that the mother�s parents were
interfering and that they should be making the decisions and appeared to have
no insight at all on the impact on B of moving backwards and forwards every few
days between his flat and the mother�s flat. 

 

204.� His
lack of insight in relation to what a young baby needed in terms of stability�
was perhaps demonstrated by his view that B did in fact have a routine moving
backwards and forwards from the property but I am afraid the chronology is
firmly against him.� He denied any suggestion that the relationship was
unstable but the text messages clearly adds support to the chronology for the
constant arguing and bickering between the parties.� His contention therefore
that the �relationship was fine� was breathtaking.� 

 

205.� I
have already mentioned that there are some disclosed entries in relation to his
Facebook account and that of the mother.� Perversely, and it was an act of
crass stupidity in the teeth of a direction given by me I note that the mother
deleted two messages from her Facebook account which related to allegations
made by the father of her using drugs.� 

 

206.� I
return to his exchanges with Dr Shrestha in the hospital to which I have
already alluded.� Dr Shrestha�s contemporaneous account was put to him and his
use of bad language.� It was plainly a loss of temper but he would not accept
it justifying his behaviour by claiming that Dr Shrestha had lied to him.�
There seemed to be little capacity for any understanding on his part that he
could have dealt with his upset in a different way.

 

207.� Dr
Shrestha also recorded a slightly later incident the same day when once again
he became aggressive and was agitated and pacing the floor and the father said
that his emotions were running high and it was the only way he could express
his feelings maintaining that his loss of control does not happen suddenly and
it would need something hurtful or untrue to make him agitated such any
suggestion that he had hurt his son.� Once again, an even allowing for the
extreme difficulty of this interview with Dr Shrestha, I was struck by his self
justification and complete absence of any strategies to deal with matters in a
different way.

 

208.� He
was challenged that there may have been difficulties in the way in which he
handled B by perhaps not holding his head up and holding him like �a little
aeroplane.�� But he maintained that he was always careful with B and there was
no rough handling.

 

209.� He
accepted that he has lied about the relationship with the mother and he didn�t
tell the police or Dr Shrestha but perversely in the context of the extent of
the domestic violence does not accept that he has not been truthful.� 

 

210.� He
was not able to accept that the mother was sometimes in fear of him and was not
able to differentiate between what he called �an empty threat� and what would
be perceived by a third party.

 

211.� He
was taken to a portion of the mother�s latest statement that the maternal
grandfather had reported to the social worker that he thought that she was
scared of the father.� She said �he is right, I was scared of him because his
temper is so unpredictable.� One minute he can be fine and the next minute
really angry and violent.�� The mother said in the selfsame passage that she
did not feel that she could take the risk in leaving B with the father although
he did not think that he would necessarily hurt B.� Again, father when
challenged with that passage said that the mother knew him and knew that the
threats would not happen.� He has little understanding of his impact on other
people.

 

212.� In
terms of minimisation, his account of 9th September both in his statement and
orally was less than satisfactory.� Mother recorded that she had received a
bruise and a cut lip.� He was prepared to accept a bruise.� When pressed he was
prepared to accept that on this occasion that he had lost his temper but sought
to justify by saying that he really didn�t think about it and it was in the
context of an argument in which the mother said that he would never see her and
B again rather than on the mother�s account, him slapping her when she said
that she was going to report him to the social worker because he was preventing
her leaving in the taxi.� What is truly astonishing about this incident is that
the father was so disinhibited and so oblivious of being in a public place and
his behaviour witnessed by an independent third party, namely the taxi driver,
that nevertheless he proceeded to assault the mother in a totally unacceptable
way.� This goes directly to his lack of self control.� 

 

213.� The
incident when he slapped the mother by way of retaliation (he says) when
sitting in his parked car in August, he sought to justify in that he said it
felt like a boy was hitting him, in other words the mother hit him quite hard.�
As he was taken by surprise he reacted as if a boy had been sitting next to him
and hit him.� This account is totally implausible as he would have been aware
of the mother sitting next to him sitting in the car listening to music before
the incident happened.� 

 

214.� Whatever
his account he was resistant to the notion that this was in fact an incident of
domestic violence describing it as �an accident� all arising out of a
misunderstanding.� It was suggested to him that he was reluctant to admitting
hitting the mother on a regular basis (as she has said) because it was
embarrassing but he didn�t accept that an allegation of that sort could be
embarrassing.

 

215.� His
account of what occurred in the bedroom at the mother�s parents� house on 31st
May was challenged.� He said that he was not pinning the mother down but she
could have been crying because their son was in care.� His case is that he was
just talking to the mother but the maternal grandfather was sufficiently
concerned to have entered the room hearing of his daughter�s distress.� Once
again, more self justification.� The father didn�t like the way the maternal
grandfather spoke to him.� He was unable to provide any coherent explanation as
to why the maternal grandfather and the mother should lie about this incident
and I am fully persuaded that it happened in the way described by the mother
and rehearsed in an email sent by the social worker on the same day after the
facts had been reported to her. 

 

216.� He
was taken to his account of what occurred on 1st May.� The police documentation
indicates that there was some sort of disagreement amongst adults which they
report was �alcohol fuelled.�� The father was not drinking, the mother had had
a drink and they had been at his mother�s house a short distance away.� There
was an argument as he wished to go home and the mother wanted to stay and he
took B to his flat accompanied by a friend called Lynn.� It seems that his
brother was involved at the behest of his mother and the brother started
shouting outside his property in the street.� We know from other evidence that
the mother was sitting with the brother�s girlfriend in their car outside.� The
record is clear that the father called the police.� He was breathalysed by
police and found not to be over the limit and a question arose as to where B
should stay the night.� It was he that went in the police car to the maternal
grandparents with B and he was not happy at having to take B to the maternal
grandparents.� 

 

217.� There
was no insight at all at the impact of this episode, howsoever it was caused,
on B and the lack of control at every level emanating from the adults. 

 

218.� Social
Services were necessarily involved by police and mother did not resume visiting
his property until a letter was sent by Social Services dated 7th May.� He
accepted thereafter the mother came to stay with him once again from time to
time in the period from 7th May leading up to B�s admission on 22nd May.

 

219.� Throughout
his evidence he was clear that he had done nothing either intentionally or
accidentally to harm B and it is an enduring feature of this case, that
notwithstanding the differences between the parents, he is supported in that
view by the mother.

 

220.� He
emerged in evidence as a volatile young man who presents very accurately in
accordance with the Local Authority assessments of him.� I have little doubt
that he has shown loving interaction to B and it is significant that contact
was improved when he enjoyed contact on his own.� His lack of empathy or
understanding in relation the impact of his aggressive and volatile behaviour
on others is marked and he and the mother have unnecessarily exposed B to
domestic violence and instability all of which goes directly to their capacity
to provide good enough care and the risk of significant harm to B. 

 

Relevant
Law

221.�� So
as to assist the court from the outset with its fact-finding enquiry the
relevant legal principles are summarised below. 

222.�� The burden of proving the facts
required to establish either limb of section 31(2)(a) CA rests on the Local
Authority (see Re H and R (Child Sexual Abuse: Standard of
Proof) [1996] 1 FLR 80, affirmed in Re
B (Care Proceedings: Standard of Proof) [2008] UKHL 35, [2008] 2 FLR 141).

 

223.�� The standard of proof in finding
facts necessary to establish the threshold under section 31(2) CA (or the
welfare considerations in section 1 CA) is the simple balance of probabilities
(see Re
B
above).

 

224.�� The test for identifying the
perpetrator of harm is also the simple balance of probabilities (see Re
S-B (children) (non-accidental injury) [2009] UKSC 17, [2010] 1 FCR 321).

 

225.�� It is the role of the court to
consider all the circumstances of the case. In Re B
above, Baroness Hale observed, at para [31]:

�Judges ... are
guided by many things, including the inherent probabilities, any
contemporaneous documentation or records, any circumstantial evidence tending
to support one account rather than the other, and their overall impression of
the characters and motivations of the witnesses.� 

 

226.�� Per Butler-Sloss P in Re
T (Abuse: Standard of Proof) [2004] EWCA Civ 558, [2004] 2 FLR 838, at para
[33]:

��Evidence cannot be evaluated and assessed in separate
compartments. A judge in these difficult cases has to have regard to the
relevance of each piece of evidence to other evidence and to exercise an
overview of the totality of the evidence in order to come to the conclusion
whether the case put forward by the Local Authority has been made out to the
appropriate standard of proof.� 

 

227.�� In Re B
(Non-Accidental Injury: Compelling Medical Evidence) [2002] EWCA Civ 902, [2002] 2 FLR 599, the Court of Appeal held: 

�        
that
in determining whether the standard required is met, it is very necessary to
view each stage in the history of the case in the light of all the others �
concerns that arose in relation to later periods inevitably infected earlier
periods; and

�        
further
that the issues of protection and perpetration had to be considered in the
round � adverse findings in relation to the failure to protect were inevitably
relevant to the findings as to perpetration.

 

228.�� Per Charles J in
A County Council v K, D and L [2005] EWHC 144 (Fam), [2005] 1 FLR 851,
at para [28]:

�[In] my view,
in determining the facts, a court should have regard to the guidance given in R
v Lucas (Ruth) [1981] QB 720 and R v Middleton [2000] TLR 293.
As appears therefrom, a conclusion that a person is lying or telling the truth
about point A does not mean that he is lying or telling the truth about point
B. Also I accept that there can be many reasons why a person might not tell the
truth to a court concerned with the future upbringing of a child.�

229.�� Also
of relevance in the same case : ��It is important to remember

(1) that the roles of the
court and the expert are distinct; and 

(2) it is the court that is
in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on the
other evidence. The judge must always remember that he or she is the person who
makes the final decision.' 

 

�In a case where the medical evidence is to the effect that the
likely cause is non-accidental and thus human agency, a court can reach a
finding on the totality of the evidence either 

(a) that on the balance of
probability an injury has a natural cause, or is not a non-accidental injury;
or 

(b) that a Local Authority
has not established the existence of the threshold to the civil standard of
proof ��

 

230.������ In Re R (Care
Proceedings: Causation) [2011] EWHC 1715 (Fam), [2011] 2 FLR 1384,
Hedley J, who had been part of the constitution of the Court of Appeal in the R v Henderson;
Butler; Oyediran case, developed this point further. At para
[10], he observed: 

 

�A temptation there described is ever present in Family
proceedings too and, in my judgment, should be as firmly resisted there as the
courts are required to resist it in criminal law. In other words, there has to
be factored into every case which concerns a discrete aetiology giving rise to
significant harm, a consideration as to whether the cause is unknown. That
affects neither the burden nor the standard of proof. It is simply a factor to
be taken into account in deciding whether the causation advanced by the one
shouldering the burden of proof is established on the balance of
probabilities.' 

 

231.������ Later in the judgment, at para [19], Hedley J added
this observation: 

 

�In my judgment a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an
infant represents neither professional nor forensic failure. It simply
recognises that we still have much to learn and it also recognises that it is
dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury, merely from the absence of
any other understood mechanism. Maybe it simply represents a general
acknowledgment that we are fearfully and wonderfully made.' 

 

Additional
law

232.� There
have been one or two recent decisions at first instance in relation to so
called shaken baby cases in which the judges concerned have highlighted the
difficulties of attributing the presence of subdural haemorrhages, retinal
haemorrhages and encephalopathy to some malignant cause of inflicted injury
against a sometimes complex and conflicting range of medical evidence.

 

233.� In
the case of Lancashire County Council v R [2013] EWHC 3064 (Fam)
Mostyn J reviewed the expert evidence of a paediatrician, a neonatologist and
an ophthalmologist who varied in the strength of their view that the injuries
were non-accidental.

 

234.� I
draw from that decision a number of themes as described by the Learned Judge :-

1.����� The
presence of subdural and retinal haemorrhages and encephalopathy (which taken
together form the well known �triad� referred to in the jurisprudence and the
medical literature) do not of themselves prove anything other than the
infliction of a head injury.� 

 

2.����� In
as much as the presence of the triad or some of its components, are used in the
process of forensic proof and this is based on statistical or empirical
evidence which states that there is a high prevalence of those features in many
proven cases of abuse.� However the difficulties involved in conducting
examinations and particularly CT scans on young children in that the data is
compiled from a subset of children presenting with head injuries in which there
is a high prevalence of suspected abusers.� Accordingly the sample upon which
the empirical analysis is based may be said to be false or skewed.

 

3.����� In
the realm of subdural bleeds there seems to be a shift away from the recent
prevailing orthodoxy with authority of research now demonstrating as false the
supposition that a presence of a subdural haemorrhage in a recently born child
is strongly indicative of abuse unless the birth was especially traumatic.�
Current medical and clinical thinking is now prepared to accept that short
falls can in many cases cause subdural bleeds and the view that this could only
happen exceptionally is regarded as outdated.

 

4.����� The
ophthalmological world has not undergone an equivalent shift in thinking and
the view remains that multitudinous bilateral retinal haemorrhages are strongly
indicative of abuse.� But this is not a unanimous view with a body of material
shortly to be published which challenges the orthodoxy as well as a report by
an American pathologist advising the need for caution in concluding that abuse
has occurred.

 

5.����� A
schism is beginning to form between the subdural and retinal disciplines
concerning the forces involved in low level falls and in some respects medical
evidence given on behalf of respective disciplines is irreconcilable.� It would
be dangerous to judge the case predominantly by reference to the mainstream
orthodox opinion expressed by the ophthalmologist particularly where there is a
research in the wings which may question that orthodoxy.� The overall
assessment of the medical evidence looked at in isolation was that it did not
provide a sure or firm basis on which to conclude that it was more likely than
not that the injuries were caused abusively.

 

6.����� The
absence of any telltale concomitant injuries which so often feature in shaking
cases was important in helping inform the court�s judgment.� It was also of
significance that the mother who knew the father better than anyone, firmly
believed he was telling the truth.� 

 

7.����� No
weight would be placed on the father�s criminal record of assaults on adult
males or on some instance of abuse of the mother which were of a class apart
from the conduct alleged here.

 

235.� Also
of note are the words in Mr Justice Baker in his judgment in the case of Gloucester
County Council and JS (2012) EWHC 1370 (Fam), when he said
�manifestly there has been considerable development in medical knowledge in
this area in the last decade.� The most striking is research into birth induced
subdurals.� There is also greater understanding about the presence and
behaviour venous membranes within chronic subdural haematoma and the propensity
for the veins in the membranes to fracture, causing re-bleeding to recur within
chronic collections.� In addition, Mr Richards and Dr Anslow confirmed that
subdural haematoma can cross from one hemisphere of the cranium into the other
� . �� The Judge noted that one eminent expert in that case observed that there
had been an evolution of understanding about subdural haematoma over the last
few years and that he was sure there was more to be discovered.�� I have of
course had all these features in mind in assessing the broad canvass of the
evidence.

 

236.�� In
the context of perhaps the need, with the benefit of hindsight, and the
observations of the experts in this case that the involvement of a
neuro-surgeon would have been helpful, in a similar case (as yet unreported
save in Lawtel) Devon County Council v EB [2013] EWHC 968 (Fam) Baker J said 

������������������ �This case
demonstrates yet again the importance of a full and thorough forensic
examination of cases of suspected child abuse. A full and thorough
investigation involves a number of elements� Secondly, this case required the
involvement of a range of experts from different disciplines. If the case had
been decided purely on the basis of the treating doctors. The outcome may have
been very different. The perspective brought� by�. has been very important.
Judges will be rigorous in resisting the call for unnecessary use of experts in
family proceedings but equally will not hesitate to endorse the instruction of
experts where, under the new rules, they are satisfied they are necessary for
the determination of the issues in proceedings.� (paras 155 and 156) 

 

Findings
and conclusion re the medical issues

237.� Helpfully
in this case, the Local Authority properly conceded at the conclusion of the
evidence that it would be difficult to persuade the court to make findings of
non-accidental head injury with Counsel for the Local Authority conceding that
the evidence pointed in a number of different directions and that he could not
rule out the prospect of a birth related cause or unknown aetiology, that the
court�s task was �in no way an easy one� and that the Local Authority has a
difficult course to chart.

 

238.� Significantly
Dr Sprigg accepted in cross examination that it was not easy to fit all the
pieces of the jigsaw together and there was a lot of missing information.� Mr
Elston described the evidence as to retinal haemorrhaging �perplexing and
difficult� and that it was �absolutely right� to consider unknown cause.�
Professor Wyatt said that this is an unusual and complex case and that it was
difficult to get the pieces to fit together and that as the evidence was
developing it was not getting any easier.� He said he was not in a position to
rule anything out.� 

 

239.� There
is consensus at the Bar as to the nature and extent of the special evidential
difficulties that occur in this case and effectively these have been set out by
Mr Samuels� in what is unusually, and helpfully, really� a joint submission.� I
can do no better than to rehearse the very powerful points he makes in this
judgment.� The points that I rehearse below make it abundantly clear that the Local
Authority�s assessment of the evidential difficulties in relation to the case
are legion and the case, if based on non-accidental head injury alone, would
inevitably fail to cross the threshold.

 

240.� In
the hope that this judgment will add to the debate regarding such cases I
faithfully rehearse the points made below:-

�� (1)� It is impossible to distinguish
by way of scan alone between an �acute on chronic� subdural presentation and an
acute bleed accompanied by an acute traumatic effusion (the escape of CSF into
the subdural space through a tear or other perforation in the arachnoid
membrane) (Dr Sprigg). Thus it was impossible for the experts to determine
whether what had occurred to B was a single event or a combination of 2 or
multiple events. The clinical evidence e.g. analysis of the subdural tap did
not appear to assist on this issue.

��������� 

��������� (2)���� Dr Sprigg found
evidence of compartmentalisation and stranding on the MRI scanning which, if
present at the time of admission, would provide strong evidence to support an
acute on chronic presentation.� Unfortunately, the MRI scan in this case only
took place after the subdural tap and it was therefore impossible to know
whether what was seen was pre-existing or a result of the surgical
intervention.

 

��������� (3)���� None of the experts
could rule out the possibility that B had sustained an asymptomatic SDH at
birth. From the most recent research paper (Rooks) it seems that up to 46% of
babies are born with asymptomatic SDHs. It is at present unclear what the
predisposing factors are likely to be but it is evident that SDHs occur with
all delivery methods including caesarean. There is no real evidence base as to
what then happens to those children � only 27 children from the 3 studies were
followed up. Experience from other areas suggests that a small proportion of
such SDHs might, for reasons unknown, develop into chronic effusions. That is
likely to be due to a combination of liquid being drawn from other areas into the
SDH and the process of re-bleeding. All the experts conceded that B could have
been one of those children, however small the percentage.

 

��������� (4)���� The only measurements
taken of B�s head circumference were shortly after birth and at hospital in May
2013 � there was nothing in between recorded either by the health visitor or
during the hospital admission in April. During this time his head circumference
had increased from the 9th to the 91st centile. Professor
Wyatt agreed that it was more likely that this had been a gradually evolving
problem rather than associated with an acute event shortly before the May
hospital admission, but he could not rule this out.� After giving his oral
evidence Professor Wyatt provided his own chart of the increase in head circumference
which does support the inference that there was a pre-existing problem.� A
dramatic increase in head circumference immediately prior to the hospital
admission would have been expected to cause a more severe clinical
deterioration than had occurred to B.

 

��������� (5)���� In his report and at
the experts meeting Dr Sprigg had drawn attention to a �tiny amount� of fresh
blood present in the sub arachnoid space. He had concluded that this was
strongly suggestive of an acute event shortly before the May hospital visit.�
However this has to be balanced against the evidence of Professor Wyatt who
accepted that such blood might have been caused through fitting or by an unseen
episode of apnoea.� The court has to be alive in these cases to the possibility
of �a domino effect� from a pre-existing problem and that much remains unknown
about the progression of these unusual head injuries. Some experts postulate
that blood can cross the arachnoid membrane although this remains untested. It
is perhaps important in these cases not to give too much weight to one
particular medical finding but for the court to consider the evidence in the
round. There is much less of a prospect then of future developments in medical
science undermining the foundation of a previous finding. 

 

��������� (6)���� In his report, Dr
Sprigg had drawn attention to the fact that B appeared to have a large
subarachnoid space. He postulated that this �may mean that the head is
relatively loose inside the skull, as a theoretical predisposition to acute
subdural haemorrhage.� This was the opposite
of what is usually seen in the presence of large bilateral subdural collections
where there may be some degree of compression of the subarachnoid space and
ventricles. Dr Sprigg could not explain why there may be a predisposition to
subdural but not subarachnoid bleeding, given that the bridging veins which are
said to be one possible cause of subdural bleeding (and are more susceptible to
bleeding if they are stretched) also run across the subarachnoid space.� 

 

��������� (7)���� In his oral evidence
Dr Sprigg drew attention to a small amount of fresh subdural blood in the
cerebellum and away from the site of any chronic collection. Although this had
not formed the subject of any particular comment in his report or at the
experts meeting, he said in his oral evidence that this too was strongly
suggestive of an acute event. He did not accept the prospect that acute blood
might move from one part of the head to another and suggested that if anything
the chronic collection would be more watery and more likely to move.� When
pressed he said he was unable to produce any research material to substantiate
that conclusion and accepted that this was �at the cutting edge� of medical
understanding. This appears to contradict the evidence of Professor Wyatt who
described a chronic collection as �like engine oil� and the evidence given in Re
JS ,
referred to earlier , �where Baker J said at
paragraph 59:

������������������ �Mr Richards and Dr
Anslow confirmed that subdural haematomas can cross from one hemisphere of the
cranium into the other. Indeed, Dr Anslow demonstrated from the MRI that this
appeared to have occurred in J�s case. In surgery both Mr Carter and Mr
Richards have seen perforations in the falx, that is to say the fold in the
dura that descends into the inter-hemispheric fissure, which would permit
communication between the potential subdural spaces in the convextus above the
two hemispheres. Given these developments, it was not surprising to hear Dr
Anslow observe that there has been an evolution of understanding about subdural
haematomas over the last few years and that he is sure there is more to be
discovered. Mr Richards observed frankly of this area: �we have enormous gaps
in our knowledge. Anything anyone says is informed speculations, not
scientifically proven fact, including what I say in the reports.�

 

��������� This is all the more reason,
we suggest, not to place too much reliance on a single piece of the complex
jigsaw in these NAHI cases.

 

��������� (8)���� The evidence as to the
April hospital admission was perplexing.� B was treated as having suffered from
gastro-enteritis and this was clearly the view of the treating doctors on this
occasion.� However, as Professor Wyatt analysed in his report the evidence
really pointed in a different direction.� B did not appear to be suffering from
diarrhoea, which would be unusual with gastro-enteritis. He did not have an
elevated temperature.� He did have significantly raised blood pressure and an
unusually low haemoglobin level which would be more consistent with raised
intracranial pressure secondary to a SDH. However, if that were to be the
explanation then it would be unusual for the symptoms to resolve spontaneously
without treatment. He accepted that an enlargement of B�s head consequent upon
the raised intracranial pressure might have relieved the pressure and therefore
the symptoms.� Without wanting to criticise the medical staff in April, SDH
would have been on his list of possible causes for B�s symptoms and an
investigation into possible head injury on that occasion (or at very least a
measurement of B�s head circumference) would have resolved many of the unknowns
that the court is currently grappling with.

 

��������� (9)���� Even more perplexing
was the ophthalmic evidence. No reliable ophthalmic examination took place
until over 12 hours after the subdural tap was performed (2.30am 25th
May). Dr Issa, Associate Specialist in Opthalmology, conducted a full
examination at 3pm on 25th May and found 2 blot haemorrhages in B�s
right eye with no haemorrhages in his left eye. B was later examined by Dr
Burke and Mr Benjamin, Consultant Ophthalmic Surgeon, on 30th May.
Mr Benjamin found no haemorrhages to B�s right eye and 2 intra retinal
haemorrhages and a macular haemorrhage to his left eye. Mr Elston concluded in
his report that �the retinal abnormalities in this case are problematic and not
susceptible to straightforward analysis.�
Mr Benjamin had postulated in his letter that the haemorrhages he saw could
have been the result of raised intracranial pressure resulting from the
surgical intervention and reiterated this in response to being shown Mr
Elston�s report. Mr Issa had responded that he agreed with Mr Elston�s
conclusion. There was some suggestion that Mr Issa, an experienced doctor, may
have got his right and left mixed up. Not only was there no direct evidence
upon which the court could reach such a conclusion but, as Mr Elston accepted,
this could not provide a full explanation as the haemorrhages seen by each were
different in number and in location. It was possible that by 30th
May the haemorrhages to the right eye seen on 25th May had resolved
but if new haemorrhages were to have developed in that time, given B was in
hospital, the only likely explanation was raised intracranial pressure. If
anything, the pressure was likely to have been greater before rather than after
the surgery. Thus if raised intracranial pressure was the explanation for the
haemorrhages seen on 30th May they could not be excluded as the
explanation for those seen on 25th (indeed Mr Elston conceded as a
matter of common sense that if RHs are noted on two separate occasions within a
relatively short time frame the cause of each is likely to be the same). Mr
Elston readily accepted the prospect of unknown cause as an alternative
hypothesis.

 

��������� (10)�� In short, an analysis
based on the �triad� was unlikely to be of any assistance in this case. It was
possible for the SDH to have a birth related origin. At least one, and possibly
both, sets of retinal haemorrhages were likely to have been caused by raised
intracranial pressure or were simply unexplained. Any encephalopathy in this
case was relatively mild and symptoms arising from the development of a birth
related SDH could not be excluded as a cause. There was certainly no imaging to
suggest B had sustained any brain injury. 

 

��������� (11)�� There was no evidence
of any contusion or axonal injury to B�s brain. A skeletal survey had revealed
no fracture injuries. On admission to hospital B was not reported to have
sustained any bruising. There was evidence of bruising to both arms and to his
left hip noted the day after admission which disappeared within 2 days. However
the treating clinicians had been quick to consider and to note in the medical
records the prospect that such bruising could have been caused when undertaking
a lumbar puncture. Thus it was impossible to attribute the bruising to any NAI
inflicted prior to hospital admission. 

 

��������� (12)�� Whilst the court
inevitably surveys the wide canvas in these cases, there was nothing on the
evidence heard by the court to suggest that either of these parents would
inflict a NAHI on B.� Although young, both presented as loving and caring
parents.� Although the father has something of a history of violence, and was
said by the mother to have slapped her and pulled her hair on frequent occasions
and to have head butted her once causing bruising, the court could not assume
he would similarly assault B.� A propensity of violence generally does not of
itself provide an evidential foundation to assume perpetration of violence to a
young baby.� Nor can it necessarily be inferred that B had been �caught in the
crossfire� of a dispute between his parents. What was notable in this case was
that neither parent could believe that the other would cause harm to B and
neither gave account of an incident where harm may have resulted to B.� What
was also important is that the LA and the Guardian did not seek to challenge
the account that each gave of the events giving rise to B�s hospital admission
in April and May.� On both occasions prompt medical attention was sought for B
and a consistent history of the development of B�s symptoms was given to the
treating clinicians.� However tempting it may be to conclude that a young man
with a propensity to violence to adults (or a young mother receiving less than
optimum support during night time feeds) must have inflicted harm on his young
baby, such a temptation would reflect lazy judicial decision making. An overall
analysis of the evidence in this case did not point with sufficient clarity
towards a conclusion of NAHI. Thus, the LA could not, as they recognised,
discharge the burden of proof upon them.�

 

241.�� I
have subjected each of these submissions to careful scrutiny. They are well
made out and correspond with the Court�s concerns regarding the medical
evidence. The Local Authority�s stance therefore is expressly approved.� The
evidential burden cannot be discharged. 

 

Threshold
findings

242.� The
parents have conceded that the threshold criteria pursuant to s.31 (2) of the
Children Act has been met.� The Local Authority asserts that B was exposed to
domestic abuse in the period between his birth and the second hospital
admission on 23rd May and the court is invited to make findings in relation to
the Local Authority�s amended threshold document which relates to the evidence
that has now emerged in relation to domestic abuse.� The additional findings
are clearly set out in the amended Scott Schedule.� 

 

243.� Further,
the guardian invites the court to make additional findings based on the court�s
impression of key witnesses and their responsibility for the instability to B
in the first eight weeks of his life.� I shall come to those presently.

 

244.� By
way of introduction to these specific findings the court has been mindful as to
the extent of both the parents� vulnerability.� Father admitted in evidence
that in 2012 he tried to hang himself from a tree.� His anger, aggression and
cannabis use are set out clearly in the papers.� The court is also mindful of
the positives in relation to the father namely that he clearly loves B and
actively promotes the mother as B�s prospective carer.� He is clearly a young
man who struggles to maintain his emotions as demonstrated by the findings and
any prospective role that he may have in B�s care needs to be carefully
evaluated.

 

245.� The
mother is also vulnerable.� She has had depression and is currently assisted by
medication.� Her psychological vulnerability needs to be explored in assessment
as indeed does both parties� cognitive abilities.� 

 

246.� The
second feature to mention by way of preamble to the findings is the issue of
lies.� Both parents have lied.� I mention in passing that both lied to Dr
Shrestha regarding domestic violence.� Mother has lied in her past statements
regarding the extent of domestic violence which she alleged at the hearing and
in her final statement.� The mother also lied in relation to spending part of a
weekend staying with the father in September.

 

247.� Mother
has admitted that she has lied because she was ashamed and embarrassed about
what had happened and had not recognized until recently that it was an
unhealthy relationship.� In my judgment it goes farther than that, namely that
it is clear from the text messages that she continued to be enmeshed in a
relationship with the father to whom, to this day, she feels attached.� It goes
therefore further than her explanation that she lied just through shame and
embarrassment and, in my judgment, the mother is now telling the truth because
she recognises the need for her to be honest so that the court can properly
determine B�s future, and I suspect she has been well advised.

 

248.� In
my review of the father�s evidence it was clear that I found him to be either
grossly minimising the extent of his abusive conduct or lying.� I of course
throw into the balance that he was broadly truthful about the extent of the
entries on Facebook but his motive for lying, in my judgment, is that he wishes
to portray himself in a better light in relation to the court�s evaluation of
him as an individual with a role to play in B�s life.

 

249.� I
have carefully scrutinised the parents� respective accounts in relation to the
issues.� I have looked at the contemporaneous records where they exist.� I am
entirely persuaded that on the balance of probabilities the mother�s account is
to be preferred over and above that of the father and that the evidence that
she has given in the witness box in relation to the father�s conduct, as set
out in her fourth statement and in the witness box, is true. I have considered
whether she would have a motive to lie or exaggerate and reject that
proposition firmly.� She has no reason to lie.� If anything she would have a
motive for concealing the extent to which B was exposed to her abusive
relationship with the father.�� I therefore find that all the domestic abuse
set out in paragraph 2 of the Local Authority�s Scott Schedule is true as
indeed are all the findings sought in paragraph 3 under the title� �Additional
Findings.�

 

250.� Paragraph
3.16 requires some refinement and I make a finding regarding the mother�s false
account of the continuing relationship between herself and the father limited
to her initial lie about spending the night and the next day with the father on
221st and 22nd September. Subject to that, I make all the findings sought by the
Local Authority. 

 

251.� The
guardian wishes the court to go further in relation to findings.� I have read
the guardian�s submissions with care together with the chronology attached
thereto which demonstrates the various comings and goings of B in the first
eight weeks of his life.

 

252.� I
have no hesitation in finding that B�s security, stability and wellbeing was
not prioritised during that period of time and the role of the maternal
grandparents as a protective force at that time left a lot to be desired even
making allowance as I do, for the difficulty in them being able to effectively
police the activities of their daughter.� The maternal grandmother minimised
the volatility of the relationship between the mother and the father and there
was no evidence that she ever questioned or challenged the mother regarding the
very evidence instability to which B was being exposed.� There will of course
be an opportunity for her to reflect on those shortcomings but it would be
wrong if they were not clearly identified in this judgment.

 

253.� The
role of the maternal grandfather also bears some comment.� He was complicit in
his daughter�s lie that she did not spend the weekend of 20th to 22nd September
at the father�s home.� He is serving three years for an offence of violence.�
He has a range of difficulties of his own and the viability assessment of the
maternal grandparents makes it plain that there were two serious incidents
involving him assaulting the maternal grandmother while in drink.� The papers
reveal that he tried to kill himself in August 2013� by taking an overdose of
Diazepam (which is the same drug the mother is prescribed for her depression).�
I make no particular adverse comment regarding that summation but these are all
features that should �go into the mix� in relation to any plan for future care.

 

254.� However
in relation to the guardian�s position, I have no difficulty in finding that B�s
peripatetic life moving backwards and forward from home to home in the first
eight weeks of his life was directly contrary to his welfare and it is an
important feature that as part of that picture important medical appointments
were not kept.� 

 

255.� This
is a case where it is absolutely necessary that there needs to be an expert
risk assessment involving the principal adults to determine the viability of
care by family members.

 

256.� I
should record that I am grateful to all Counsel for their careful handling of
an extremely difficult and complex case.� I have reiterated in more than one
judgment recently that the integrity of the forensic process in family justice
would be severely undermined and compromised if it were not for the expertise
of the Family Bar coupled with the availability of experts of the highest
possible calibre to assist the court.� That would necessarily include the
availability of public funding for leading Counsel in early course of the
proceedings to assist the court with determining complex issues surrounding the
instruction of experts particularly in head injury cases. An additional essential
ingredient to achieve justice is the availability of experts of sufficient
expertise to assist the Court in these difficult NAHI cases. I fear the pool is
diminishing and the public funding cap on levels of remuneration does not assist
to reverse that process.

�JUDGE VENABLES: 

 

1                  
I am today
concerned with applications for a care order and a placement order in respect
of a little boy named A , who was born on 12 June 2013.� His mother is Z and
his father is unknown.� A�s mother is just 16.� She is soon to be 17 and is
herself a looked after child.� Z has declined to provide any details about A�s
father, save to say that she does not want the baby to hear negative things
about his father. 

 

2                  
�A was very much
a wanted baby.� Z made clear that she wanted to have and care for her own child
to experience and share the unconditional love which she feels she never
experienced with� her own mother and father.

 

3                  
The local
authority�s applications are supported by A�s guardian, Miss Rosetti.� Z
opposes the local authority�s applications.� Z gave evidence before me today
and told me in heart felt terms why she had wanted the chance to care for her
baby.� She was not cross-examined by any of the parties and I was not invited
to hear any live evidence from the other witnesses.

 

4                  
Z has had a very
difficult childhood.� Her mother is an alcoholic.� There was an acrimonious
split between her parents.� She lived with her father most of the time until
she was about 12 and from there seems to have bounced between the care of her
parents until she was accommodated at the request of her mother at 13 on the
basis that she was outside of parental control.� She fell pregnant and had a
termination when she was 13 after her mother agreed that she could return
home.� The termination was a huge issue for her.� It is clear from the social
work statements and from the independent social worker�s assessment that the Z
positively decided to have A to replace the baby she lost.

 

5                  
Z has had three
very challenging three years since going into local authority accommodation.�
She declined the offer of a referral to CAMHS services by the local authority.
Today she tells me will take up those services if it will help her keep the
baby. She is semi-engaged in education.� The local authority is concerned that
that she has been sexually exploited by older men .

 

6                  
Having heard
Mother give evidence it is apparent she is bright and with academic potential.�
She has been scapegoated within the family.� Her mother, her father and to an
extent her sister all see her as being responsible for her own problems and for
some of the problems within the wider family.

 

7                  
However from the
time Z became pregnant with A� she endeavoured to work with her family (
particularly her mother and her sister with whom she was then living) the local
authority and the medical agencies.� She ate well.� She remained in her
placement.� She listened to and she took advice.� She continued to work well
with the agencies after A was born.� The professionals noted how attentive and
loving she was with A, even if she appeared inexperienced and uncertain in his
practical care.

 

8                  
On 1 August, the
placement with the family broke down.� Z reported that the family was
dysfunctional. She was concerned about her mother drinking. The maternal
grandmother reported Z was leaving A a lot and that she was being left with�
primary responsibility for A�s care.

 

9                  
�Later that day
Mother and A were moved to a mother and baby foster placement in Kent.� Mother
says this was a real problem because it was so far away from everyone and
everything. Nonetheless, the placement endured until 22 September, when Mother
took A over to her father�s home and went off to see her boyfriend.� She did
not return as arranged and didn�t make telephone contact.� Mother says that she
intended to go back but she fell asleep at her friend�s house. 

 

10             
In the days
following Mother�s failure to collect A the local authority tried to establish
whether she wished to resume his care. She was understandably upset and asked
for some time to think about things.� In the event she said that she was
concerned that she could not offer what A needed. 

 

11             
Thereafter she
declined an offer of a further mother and baby foster placement and she
disengaged from education.� After proceedings were issued she� made an
application for an assessment at a mother and baby unit which was
unsuccessful.� 

 

12             
In recent times,
Z has been living in semi-independent accommodation but she has absconded for
significant periods.� She finds the unit difficult and feels very unsupported
by her family and by her own social work team.

 

13             
Z likes A�s current
foster carer and had asked the foster carer if she might be able to care for A
if she could not. Z only wants what she feels is best for him.� Contact has
been a real struggle for her. She told me only this morning how very difficult
it is to go along to contact knowing or believing that contact will be
terminated.� She has taken up a very limited amount of contact and explained
her desire to protect A from the fact that she found contact so distressing by
reducing the number of her visits.� 

 

14             
Today she brought
along some photographs of her and A.� He is a very beautiful baby and it is
clear from the photos that she loves him very much.� He was born with a cleft
palate and has since had an operation on the palate and his lip. I understand he
has made a good recovery.

 

15             
The local
authority relies on the evidence of the social work team and the independent
social worker, Carol Edwards.� Carol Edwards saw Mother and A for two periods
of three hours.� There were no further meetings after Mother disengaged. Miss
Edwards� completed her assessment on the basis of that disengagement.

 

16             
In Miss Edwards�s
view Z�s actions should be viewed as basically protective as they demonstrate
an early self awareness in Mother that she could not meet A�s needs. It takes
real courage and maturity to even begin to articulate such awareness.

 

17             
�Overall however
Miss Edwards considers Mother� has only a limited understanding of A�s need for
stability and security. This is not� surprising when considering the lack of
stability and security in her own life. Mothers current chaotic life style��
provides no basis on which to conclude� she could prioritise A�s needs over her
own unmet needs.� 

 

18             
Hearing from Z
today has confirmed my view that A is a very loved and a very much wanted
baby.� However Mother is still only 16 and� cannot meet the needs of A on her
own . She has no effective role models, no family or social structure to
support her or supplement her care of A .

 

19             
The local
authority has conducted viability assessments of the maternal grandmother, the
maternal grandfather and completed a full special guardianship assessment of
the maternal aunt, all of which are negative. 

 

20             
The basis on
which a court can consider making public law orders is set out in� Section 31
(2) of the Children Act 1989 which says this:

 

�A court may only make a care
order or supervision order if it is satisfied that (a) the child concerned is
suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm and (b) that the harm or
likelihood of harm is attributable to the care given to the child or likely to
be given to him if the order were not made, not being what it would be
reasonable to expect a parent to give to him.�

 

21             
In this case, the
threshold has been agreed between the parties. The� agreed statement of
threshold is contained at pages 47 to 48 of my bundle.� The recent Court of
Appeal authorities of Re. B, Re. G, Re. BS and Re. W remind the
court that adoption is the order of last resort.� The court cannot apply the
yardstick of proportionality without looking at the totality of the evidence
and considering the internal positives and negatives of the realistic options
for the child and where necessary ensuring the local authority inputs essential
resources to enable a family placement to be effected.

 

22             
In order to
complete that evaluation in the context of applications for both care orders
and placement orders, the court must consider both the provisions of the
Children Act and the Adoption and Children Act.� Under section 1 of the
Children Act, the welfare of each child is paramount in the considerations of
the upbringing of that child.� In this case, the provisions of section 1(3) of
the checklist which I consider to have particular significance are as follows:

 

(a)   the ascertainable wishes and feelings
of the child concerned. 

A is very young and so cannot
articulate his wishes, but it is clear he responds very well to his mother and
has enjoyed positive and meaningful contact.� 

(b) his physical, emotional and
educational needs.� 

He is young, vulnerable, with
changing and developing needs.� He has some medical needs that remained to be
assessed following his recent operation.� His mother has, in my view, struggled
with the need to allow his needs to be prioritised over her own, which is
demonstrated by the difficulties that she had in going along to contact and to
commit to a regular programme of contact for A.

 

�(c)� the likely effect on him of
any change in his circumstances.

�I calculate that he is already in
his third placement.� He was with his Mother� and then he had a short period
with a� foster carer after the mother and baby placement broke down.� He is now
with his second�� foster carer.� His current foster carer has confirmed that
she is unable to offer a permanent home for him, although Z had hoped that he
might be able to remain with her if she could not� resume� care. Family finding
advise that, in light of A�s age and his general health, they are optimistic
about the prospect of finding an appropriate placement for him.� It will
however become more challenging for him to move as he gets older. It is
essential that if he is to move he does so at a time when his attachments are
not fixed but developing.

 

� (d), his age, sex, background
and any other characteristics of his which the court considers relevant.� 

A is of dual white Caucasian and
Pakistani origin.� He is very young and he needs to be in a permanent placement
at a time when he can form secure and enduring attachments.�� He has had some
limited medical needs which may affect placement, but the evidence of Family
Finding suggests are optimistic about finding an appropriate family for him.

 

e) any harm which he has suffered
or is at risk of suffering.� 

The risk is to A�s emotional health
as Z does not, currently, have the skills or experience, or support� available�
to enable her to prioritise A�s needs over her own.

 

(f) how capable each of his
parents and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the
question to be relevant is of meeting his needs.� 

I have absolutely no doubt that Z
loves A very much, but in consequence of her� own poor childhood� and� poor support
within the community she is unable to understand and� prioritise his need for
security, stability and commitment over her own unmet needs.� 

 

23             
Under the Adoption
and Children Act 2002 the paramount consideration of the court must be the
child�s welfare throughout their life: - significantly it is not just until the
end of the child�s minority.� The additional sections of the checklist which I
feel are most pertinent to A are ;

 

�(c), the likely effect on the
child throughout his life of having ceased to be a member of the original
family and becoming an adopted person.� A will lose his connection with his
birth family. It maybe, that his cultural heritage will not be easily
replicated in the context of a future placement.� Z has made very clear her views
about his heritage and placement which have been noted by the local authority.�
Placement decisions will have an impact on A�s emotional, social and
educational development unless properly supported. 

 

�(d), the child�s age, sex,
background and any of the child�s characteristics which the court or agency
considers relevant. 

A is a small, essentially healthy,
and baby of dual heritage. His heritage�� is likely to have an impact on the
pool of available and appropriate carers.� 

�(e) any harm (within the meaning of the Children Act 1989 (c. 41)) which the child has suffered or is at risk of
suffering. 

 

�Z is unable to offer the level of
commitment, security and stability he needs and that there is a high risk of
placement breakdown.� She has no close family or friends and she has not been
able to effect a long-standing and enduring relationship with the agencies.� It
is probable that such a placement would therefore not be sustainable.

 

(f) the relationship which the child has with
relatives, and with any other person in relation to whom the court or agency
considers the relationship to be relevant, including;-

(i)
the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to the child
of its doing so

 

� A lived for a short time with his
maternal grandmother and maternal aunt, although Z was the primary carer.� That
arrangement continued until 1 August of last year.� The assessments of the
maternal grandfather, maternal grandmother and maternal aunt were negative in
part because of the lack of grand parental insight into their own role in
mother�s life.� The maternal aunt similarly had limited insight into the role
of the family and its impact upon Z.� This was demonstrated� in the maternal
aunts� response to the outcome of the assessment. The maternal grandmother and
grandfather and maternal aunt have not articulated any ongoing wish to care for
A.

(5)
In placing the child for adoption, the adoption agency must give due consideration
to the child�s religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic
background

 

He
is a young baby of dual heritage. His lanaguage has not developed. 

His
mother does not actively practice a religion.

 

 

24             
Looking at the
placement options for A they are effectively; a) placement with Z supported by
the local authority and b) adoption.� Z adores her son.� It is clear that he
was a wanted child.� At 16 Z �wanted to enjoy the unconditional love of her
child in a way that she had never felt loved by her family. I agree with the independent social
worker that she was intellectually aware of the challenges of caring for A and
knew with her head, if not her heart, that she was not ready when she declared�
that A deserved better than she could offer.� The way she subsequently
disengaged from the services and her very understandable withdrawal from
contact leads me to conclude that she has not developed the maturity, insight
and ability to identify and meet A�s needs over her own at this stage or within
A�s timeframe.� He is young and vulnerable and needs a permanent, secure family
with limited disruption.

 

 

25             
As to adoption, A
needs stability and security and commitment.� He is clearly a well loved baby
and adored by his current carer as well as his mother. �Sadly, that carer is
not able to offer him a permanent home. Adoption will mean he loses his
connection with his birth family.� His dual heritage may not be replicated but
his welfare throughout his minority will be best met by a family that commits
to him for ever, where he will have the permanence, security and stability in
placement that his young mum is simply unable to offer at this time.

 

26             
On balance, I am
clear that I must go on to make a care order and a placement order since such
orders are the only orders� that will meet A�s welfare needs throughout his
life.

 

27             
In considering
the provisions of section 52 of the Adoption and Children Act, I am clear that
Z�s consent must be dispensed with to enable the plan to be implemented. A�s
welfare demands it. �The local authority will have to ensure that the issue of
contact is looked at in the context of any placement.� I do not consider it
would be appropriate to fetter or anticipate the views of any adopters and
approve the local authority care plan for the reduction� of� parental contact .

THE JUDGE:  I am concerned with the welfare of two children: A, born on 7th�January 1999, now aged 15 years; and B, born on 30th�November 2006, aged 7.  They are both the children of C.  A's biological father D is deceased but A has always considered E as his father.  E is the father of B.

 

Mother and father commenced their relationship at a time when C was pregnant with A.  Father was a friend of C's own father.  They have been a couple until recently, although with occasional separations.

 

There has been multiagency involvement with the family over many years.  The Local Authority maintains that there are recurrent themes which can be identified within this family from an early stage and continuing with varying levels of intensity throughout the lives of these children.

 

The Local Authority seek care orders with a plan of long-term foster care for both children and for the children to be placed together.  Supervised contact is proposed in respect of both parents, although father's contact, in particular, will be kept under review.  At present, the Local Authority propose that the children remain with their current foster parents.

 

Mother accepts that she is not in a position at the moment to care for either child.  Father wishes to be the sole carer for both children in the near future.  Father opposes the making of final care orders at this stage.  It is submitted on his behalf by Ms F that the care plans are flawed and should not be approved by the court.

 

A asked for the opportunity to speak to the judge in the course of these proceedings.  I saw him in chambers along with his guardian G.  A is a young 15-year-old but made it very clear that his wish would be to return to live with both of his parents.  He wants his family to be together.  The court is in a slightly unusual position in that all the parties are aware that it has been said by mother and father that they have separated and that this time they both maintain it is a final separation.  The children have not yet been told about the separation.  Thus it has not been possible to ascertain A's or, indeed, B's wishes in the revised situation.  However, he is very clear wherever he is placed, A wants to be with B.  Nobody has suggested or is suggesting that A and B be placed separately.

 

I heard oral evidence over the course of some 15 days from 23 witnesses, including various experts, and I have had the opportunity to view the interview of A undertaken by the police during the afternoon of 30th�March 2013.  I have also had the opportunity to observe the mother and father in court over the days of the hearing as well as hearing their oral evidence.  I do, however, of course, bear in mind Macur LJ's guidance which she gave in Re M (Children) [2013] EWCA Civ 1147 in looking at how much weight I place on the parents' attitudes within the court and within the giving of evidence.  It has clearly been a very distressing case for them and I do not underestimate the effects which participating in a case of this nature must have on parents.

 

The documentation in this case is voluminous and I have read and considered the statements, reports, medical records, police interviews and additional documents contained in the five lever arch files which are before the court.

 

The law which I must apply is set out in a number of authorities referred to by the advocates and well known to the court.  It is the Local Authority who bring this case and the Local Authority must establish the facts upon which they base their case upon the balance of probability.  Suspicion and doubt cannot form the basis upon which to find a fact proved or to conclude that the grounds set out in section 31(2)(a) are established.

 

The advocates representing mother, Ms H and Ms J, do not seek to argue that the threshold criteria are not made out in relation to A and B.  However, they set out in their closing submissions, and I quote from paragraph 15 of those submissions:

 

"It therefore cannot be said that the threshold criteria are met on the basis that the children were suffering significant harm as a result of neglect at the relevant date.  The proper evidential basis for crossing the threshold is that, on the basis of past neglect there was, on the relevant date, 31st�March 2013, a likelihood, in the sense of a real possibility, that they might do so."

The threshold is, indeed, crossed.  I will return to consider further matters of law which are to be applied in respect of K's death and injuries at a later stage.

The Local Authority initiated protective measures on 31st�March 2013 following upon the death of K, who was born on 9th�March 2013, so she was aged 3 weeks at the date of her death on 30th�March 2013.  At the time of K's death, all three children were the subject of child protection plans against a background of chronic neglect.  The Local Authority seek the findings set out in the schedule of findings at A117 in the bundle and amplified in the expanded findings in respect of paragraph 2.5.2 of that schedule.  The extended findings were prepared and served during the course of the hearing at the behest of mother's advocates.  The findings sought are comprehensive and cover K's birth and death.  They refer to chronic neglect and the mother's drug misuse as it affected A and B.

 

The mother accepts that she has failed to provide good enough care for the children.  I do find that, at times, when her own life has been more controlled, she has had the capacity to and has provided adequate care for the children.  However, over the span of their lives, the care provided by her has been inconsistent and her significant and enduring drug problem has impacted upon her capacity to function efficiently and to parent her children.  Father accepts that he failed to be sufficiently proactive in enquiring and while mother has accepted that, from time to time, her care of her older children was not good enough, she disputes that the extent of her neglect was such that the children should be permanently removed from her care.  While mother does not seek the return of the children to her care presently, her response to the threshold provides an indication of her lack of appreciation of the harm the chronic neglect and inconsistent parenting has caused to both A and B.

 

Father's failure to meet his responsibilities to his children and to sustain the level of support, which he belatedly seems to have accepted was required, has contributed to the harm A and B sustained as a result of their mother's inadequate care.  There is evidence that when his support was forthcoming, the wellbeing of the children substantially improved.  However, his priorities did not seem to include the welfare of his children until latterly.

 

The expanded findings in respect of chronic neglect and drug misuse involve consideration of the long history of Social Services' involvement with the family.  Whilst trawling through numerous historic allegations may not be necessary in a large number of cases, in this particular matter, it is necessary in order to establish the chronic neglect and enduring problems to which these children were exposed prior to their removal into foster care.  The Local Authority seek to prove that recurrent themes can be identified from an early stage.  

 

Mr L has set out within his opening of this case a number of matters in respect of chronic neglect, namely:

 

(a) Missed health appointments, within the latter years, dental decay for both A and B, B's eyesight suffering, late antenatal presentation for K;

(b) Poor school attendance;

(c) Poor supervision with both A and B at times being put at risk;

(d) A lack of boundaries and routine;

(e) Poor engagement with professionals, including hostility, tape recording and simple refusal to cooperate;

(f) Volatility in the relationship between mother and father; and

(g) short-term progress followed swiftly by regression.

It is also very apparent that the mother's drug misuse, which has blighted the mother's own life over years, is very relevant in considering the events which occurred in the years leading up to K's birth and thereafter.  It is recognised by the professionals involved with this family that there has been good parenting at times and that A, in particular, but B also, wish to be with their mother.  A wishes the family to be together.  Clearly, this wish cannot be granted in any event as the parents have separated.  A has been at the centre of the traumatic events which have occurred within this family.  He was the first person to become aware of K's death.  He has been removed from his family home against his wishes and he knows decisions are being made in respect of his future.  It is hardly surprising that, set against that background and in that context, he wishes things to be the same as they were before the events of 30th�March last year.

 

It is the Local Authority who bring this case and, therefore, they must prove it and, in relation to disputed facts, they must prove it on the balance of probability.  The House of Lords' decision in Re B [2008] 2 FLR 141 made it clear that the standard of proof is the balance of probability, no more and no less, whatever the allegations or however serious those allegations are.

 

In this case I have heard from a number of expert witnesses and I must remind myself how I am to approach their evidence.  As Ward LJ set out in Re B (Care: Expert witness) [1996] 1FLR 667, the expert advises but the judge decides.  The judge decides on the evidence.  If there is nothing before the court, no facts or circumstances shown to the court which throw doubt on the expert evidence, if that is all with which the court is left, the court must accept it.  There is, however, no rule that the judge suspends judicial belief simply because the evidence is given by an expert". 

 

 The court is, of course, in a unique position, in that I have had the opportunity, indeed duty and responsibility, to consider all the evidence before me and to analyse it.  As was said by Butler-Sloss when she was President in Re U, Re B [2004] 2 FLR 263 at paragraph 26:

 

"It is for the purpose of satisfying that threshold that the local authority seeks to prove specific facts against the parent or parents. Only if it succeeds in that task can its application for a care or supervision order proceed. Thus the preliminary issue of fact constitutes the gateway to a judicial discretion as to what steps should be taken to protect the child and to promote his welfare."

She goes on to deal with the overall position.

" For the Judge invariably surveys a wide canvas, including a detailed history of the parents' lives, their relationship and their inter-action with professionals. There will be many contributions to this context, family members, neighbours, health records, as well as the observation of professionals such as social workers, health visitors and children's guardian.   In the end the Judge must make clear findings on the issues of fact before the Court, resting on the evidence led by the parties and such additional evidence as the Judge may have required in the exercise of his quasi-inquisitorial function. All this is the prelude to a further and fuller investigation of a range of choices in search of the protection and welfare of the children. A positive finding against a parent or both parents does not in itself preclude the possibility of rehabilitation. All depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case."



The judge in care proceedings we are reminded must never forget that today's medical certainty may be discarded by the next generation of experts or that scientific research will throw light into corners which are presently dark.  

I have heard from a number of medical experts who are eminent in their particular field.  In particular, I heard from M, who is the professor of bone and joint pathology; from N, paediatric pathologist; O, forensic pathologist; and P, neuropathologist.  They have each given evidence in respect of their own speciality.  I must look at and analyse the evidence I have heard, including that of each expert, and do my best to reach a conclusion, applying the balance of probability test to the evidence.  

 

The nature and extent of the neglect is, in fact, not greatly disputed.  The expanded schedule of findings sought has been responded to by C.  I will come to father's position shortly.  The advocates on mother's behalf sought the expanded schedule and specifically asked for it to include examples.  The responses emphasise mother's assertion that, by January 2013, the neglect alleged previously had been rectified.  Mother does accept that important medical and dental appointments were missed.  She accepts school attendance and matters concerning school were neglected and punctuality for both A and B was problematic.  She accepts that A, aged 8, was caught smoking and out of the home after 8pm, only supervised by a 14-year-old girl, and she accepts lack of supervision over a number of years resulting in incidents of A and B walking the streets, A drinking alcohol and setting fires, and she also accepts failure to provide boundaries and routines.  Both children have been present on occasions when mother has been arrested for shoplifting and A, aged 10, was involved in a dwelling house burglary, was arrested for theft and involved in an incident damaging trees.  Both mother and father have been banned from the local shopping centre, mother for shoplifting and father for an altercation with the security guard.

 

Mother also accepts that her cooperation with professionals was often poor.  Although she explains that she has a poor short-term memory and struggled to manage appointments made by post, she also accepts that she was not always accurate about her drug-taking but says she did not deliberately seek to deceive professionals about her drug misuse.

 

I am satisfied that the neglect of these children was significant and longstanding.  Improvements were made from time to time but they were never sustained.  Mother, in response to paragraph 15(g) in the schedule of findings, accepts that position and, in submission on mother's behalf, Ms H and Ms J set out:  

 

"The mother accepts that she has failed to provide good enough care for the children and this has been the case at various times over the years.  Whilst at times her care has been good, at others it has, on many occasions, fallen below an appropriate standard."

They ask the court to take a balanced view of the past as far as mother is concerned and Miss F, on behalf of father, similarly stresses the positives in respect of E's parenting.

It seems from the social work evidence I have heard that the children very much love their parents and, indeed, I know that they wish to go home, as I have already described.  R described the children as two lovely children, very polite and well-mannered and easy to engage.  My experience of A was that he was a polite, somewhat shy, courteous young man.  Both parents have demonstrated loving behaviour and affection for their children which has been witnessed on numerous occasions by the professionals involved in the case.  However, it is also apparent that both parents failed to meet the needs of their children and the response of mother in the scheduled findings sought is as follows:

 

"The episodes of neglectful care occurred over a long period of time but the situation was improving."

It is  further set out:

"Mother has already accepted that her care was not consistently good enough and this occurred over a long period, although, by February 2013, their physical, education and emotional needs were not being neglected."

Father, in his response to paragraph 16, namely the allegation that this neglect was significant and longstanding, sets out:

 

"Denied, though father accepts that, over the years, the needs of the children were not met consistently."

In oral evidence, it was noticeable that mother in respect of certain matters, such as the missing of appointments or not ensuring B wore her glasses, added caveats such as, "We tried our best" or, "I had a phobia about opening letters" or, "My short-term memory is bad."  In relation to the expanded schedule providing examples, particularly in respect of lack of supervision, C's response is:

 

"Mother has no recall but does not dispute the records."

It is of concern that C claims to have no recollection, whether that is in fact genuine or not.  If mother has, in fact, forgotten incidents such as when A was smoking and drinking and setting fires or being brought home in a police car, it seems that her lack of concern for A's welfare can be seen as significant.  These are incidents which would and should have been memorable to a concerned parent.

 

E's position in respect of the neglect is set out in his response at A121 within the bundle.  It is set out in relation to (c), which was the allegation of chronic neglect:

 

"As to (c), father accepts he largely left day-to-day responsibility for care to mother who failed to offer consistent standard of care to the children (see below) which he failed to recognise or be sufficiently enquiring about."

At A124 in the bundle, father sets out that he repeats and accepts he failed to be sufficiently proactive or enquiring.  " of(a), (b), (c)," which deal with medical appointments, school attendance and supervision, it is said:

 

"Are accepted, save when father took appropriate possibility. (d) [that is boundaries and routines] is accepted, save when father was physically present.  (e) [cooperation with professionals] is partially accepted, in that the father regrets he was not always fully cooperative with the professionals."

Father's case in relation to the neglect is that he did not realise it was happening.  In his oral evidence, I take a number of examples of what he said in this regard:

 

"I did not realise they were not at school for a lot of years."

"I was ignorant of what was going on a lot of the time.  I was not there."

"If I am not there, how can I ensure anything?"

Miss F submits that the Local Authority have focused overly upon the historical negatives, rather than looking at the very positive picture that existed prior to K's death and both Local Authority and guardian, she says, have failed to properly evaluate the future.

The reality, however, is that over the majority of the lives of both A and B, the care they received was inconsistent and neglectful.  The submissions made on father's behalf concentrate on the future for obvious reasons.  It is submitted that there is acknowledgement on his part that he wished he had done more and that he focused too much on his work.  

 

E had always accepted responsibility for A and it is to his credit that he did not make any difference between A and his own daughter B but he failed both of them by ignoring or just not bothering to be vigilant in regard to their welfare.  He was well aware of the mother's drug habit and, certainly, in 2006 was present in discussion with the social workers about the difficulties that mother had in respect of caring for A and managing her substance misuse.  Following B's birth, by May 2007, significant improvements were noted and E, it seems, was offering support and assisting the mother.  Father was thus well aware that C struggled to provide good enough care without his support but, with his support, the children's needs could be met.  Yet the standard of care deteriorated and A was left home alone, found on the roof of a building and he was observed smoking, out after 8pm with a 14-year-old girl and mother went shoplifting with B in the buggy.  

 

Father's response is he felt guilty and should have been there.  In evidence, E repeated that he should have done more but that he would come into the home, have a carry on with the kids and it was a happy household and he thought everything was okay.  He would not accept that, essentially, they lived as a family but said he only stayed with C occasionally.  He said:

 

"I was ignorant of what was going on a lot of the time.  I was not there.  When I realised how bad things were, I did step up to the mark.  I was shocked when [S] pointed out how bad it was.  I was kept in the dark with a lot of things."  

He also said:

"If I'm not there, how can I ensure something?  I should have been a lot more enquiring, until I realised something was going wrong and then I worked with everyone."

E knew in 2006 that C was unable to provide good enough care on her own.  The evidence was there before him of the mother's drug problems.  He expressed himself concerned about mother's substance misuse and mother's ability to meet her own health needs within the meeting in September 2006 when speaking to the social worker.  In 2008, it is recorded that, on 10th�July, after a warning of a possible police protection order, father is very supportive of mother and pledges to help her and ensure her wellbeing.  Father, it is recorded, "Said he felt guilty and says he should have been there." On 17th�September 2009, it is recorded that the health visitor and social worker made a joint visit and gave clear advice to both mother and father, advising father that he is also responsible for the children, and both parents signed an agreement.  

 

The later events to which I have referred and will refer echo what had occurred in the past.  The father's reactions and response in the past were similar to his reactions and response which he provided in the oral evidence to the court.  The concerns and neglect of the children, however, continued.

 

It was reinforced to the father on 10th�November 2009 at a care team meeting that he needed to accept responsibility and be aware at that stage that mother is at risk of overdosing.  Yet, within six weeks of that meeting, there had been three police referrals about A, largely due to the lack of supervision by the mother.  

 

It is recognised that there was an improvement in the care offered to the children towards the end of 2012 and the early part of 2013.  That improvement post-dated the social worker's indication that the Local Authority may consider presenting a plan to prevent the baby being brought home after birth and following a long discussion with the father mid-December about him assuming the role of primary carer.

 

One of C's major problems which impacted upon the care of the children was her longstanding and enduring drug misuse.  T, a worker at Organisation A gave evidence that she knew mother very well.  She had been involved with mother for five years, during which time mother's engagement was poor.  She often did not attend.  It seems there was confusion and miscommunication during the early part of January 2013 about whether it was appropriate to reduce the methadone prescription.  Such confusion and miscommunication is regrettable and did have an effect on C, U, the consultant at Hospital B, taking the view that the most important thing with a pregnant woman was to keep her stable; Organisation A had thought she should reduce her prescription during pregnancy.  

 

It is clear that, in early January, mother felt most unwell and sought help.  Mother and father attended to see V, the midwife specialising in drug problem pregnancies, on 16th�January and asked for help.  C felt very, very unwell.  She was admitted to hospital on 21st�January.  On 16th�January, mother had admitted to using amphetamine, temazepam, diazepam and cannabis.  The methadone was still being reduced but, on 16th�January 2013, a new prescription increasing the methadone was provided.  C was advised about the risks of using illicit substances while pregnant and the effect upon the unborn baby.  Mother was admitted on 21st�January and it is recorded that she told U, upon admission, that she had taken "loads of benzos" on Thursday.  That is 17th�January.  Mother admits that she remembers saying she took some benzos but she says that she did not say "loads".  Thus, it seems, the very day after she was warned about taking illlicit substances and its effect upon the baby, she took, whether it was loads or some, illicit drugs which she knew were potentially harmful to her child.  She accepted that she had been given clear advice and that she had ignored it.  She described it in evidence before me as a "minor setback".

 

I am satisfied that mother continues to have a limited understanding of the effects of her drug misuse upon her children.  Unfortunately, it seems from T's oral evidence that mother's engagement with her continues to be at times poor and inconsistent.  C has not been truthful about her drug misuse over the years and she told the police on 31st�March 2013, when interviewed, and 3rd�April 2013, that she had not taken drugs during pregnancy.  This assertion is patently untrue.

 

Father could not be anything other than well aware of mother's difficulties with drugs over the years and the effect it had upon her functioning and yet it seems he largely left matters to mother in respect of the children until late 2012.  He was closely involved with mother's admission to hospital at the beginning of 2013.  

 

It is not alleged that C has had any history of violence towards her children.  There is no history of aggression by her to them.  As submitted by Ms H and Ms J, the risks which concerned the social workers about the mother were about negligence and the impact of her taking drugs but never that she would assault K.

 

I have heard evidence in relation to the agreement reached after K's birth on 9th�March 2013.  K was suffering withdrawal and was prescribed oramorph, which the mother was required to administer.  It was expected that K would be unsettled but, in fact, there were no particular difficulties recorded with the withdrawal.  However, K suffered very considerably, it seems, from wind.  

 

A written agreement dated 25th�February 2013 had been drawn up by the Local Authority.  The expectations upon the parents are set out in a document found at C200b:

 

"Parents to ensure that [A] and [B] attend school punctually every day.

Parents to ensure that [B's] squint is reviewed at [Hospital C] with it likely that her care will transfer to a local optician.

[C] to fully engage with midwifery services, to attend all antenatal appointments and work with [Organisation A] when they resume her care.

Parents to allow a social worker to visit the home regularly and complete further assessments with both announced and unannounced home visits.

[C] to engage with [Organisation A], to attend all appointments and complete urine samples as required.

[E] to take full responsibility for the care of the children.  It is expected that [C] will not be on her own with either of the children until it is agreed by the Local Authority for [C] to have some care of the children.  

[C] has recently been into hospital for a detox and while she states she is remaining abstinent, the Local Authority require information from urine analysis to confirm this. [V] will provide this information to the Local Authority.  She is expecting to be taking weekly urine analysis.

[E] will have a discussion with his mother to ask for her assistance in being with [C] while he is out of the family home.

Both parents to attend all meetings.

Both parents to inform the social worker of any difficulties being experienced in order for the social worker to provide support.

[E] and [C] to inform the social worker of any changes in circumstances.

[E] and [C] to work with family recovery programme that will be in place to monitor the family and provide support following the birth of the baby.  It will be anticipated that this will include morning visits to enable assessment of the early morning routine and late evening to assess the night-time routine.

Will sign the written agreement."

The Local Authority, of course, had their duties also.  This document of expectation made clear the approach  the Local Authority were taking to the family in the event that the baby was to go home with the parents.

 

E in evidence said he did not recall signing a written agreement.  He said there were five separate ones.  However, he accepted that there was an agreement of which he was in breach.  He said he breached it three times.  He said the Local Authority were aware he did the school run every day and that he attended at the meetings with Social Services and, therefore, they were aware C had been left at home with K.  E did not accept that leaving C on her own when he attended a meeting or did the school run was very different to leaving her at home overnight with three children to care for, including a baby.  He did not accept that night-time could be challenging.  He said everyone would be asleep.  He accepted that nobody knew he was working at night but he said it was not like a night shift.  Further, he said S had relaxed the agreement.  When asked when that occurred, he said:

 

"She was at the house and saying how well things were going and I asked her if I could go to work now and she said, 'Aye'."

E said that he left C in the house by herself to go to meetings and that he did not think going to work was any different.

S, in evidence, stated that the agreement set out in the bundle at C200a was a working agreement and no further agreement was provided up until K's birth.  She said there was no revision of the expectations.  She told me:

 

"I wasn't aware [E] was at work.  If I was aware he was working night shift, under the contract of expectation, he would have asked his mum and I would have done some assessment work."

S said at the meeting on 28th�March that the professionals were aware upon that occasion that C was looking after the children during the course of that meeting.  S said that she was satisfied at that meeting that E was not concerned around mother's presentation on that day.  S said what was discussed was that C was not to be left on her own with the children but that she was aware that E was coming to meetings leaving C and, on those occasions, she would be at home with the children.  S did not accept that she agreed that E could go to work as often as he wanted as long as the children got to school, which was E's contention in evidence.

It is clear that the perceived risk to the children in being cared for by the mother was a risk of neglecting their needs.  However, I am satisfied that father was aware that the expectation upon him was that he was there to supervise the mother's care of the children.  Short absences, such as time taken out for meetings or taking the children to school, I find were very different to leaving mother for significant periods of time when he was working and that he was aware of this and that it was certainly not envisaged that C would be left alone with the children overnight.  Even if E was of the view, which I doubt, that it was accepted he could work, he must have been aware because of C's difficulties, of which he knew, and the concerns expressed by Social Services about her abilities to care for the children, that Social Services would not have contemplated an arrangement whereby C was left overnight caring for K, A and B.

 

It is suggested on behalf of the father in submission and I quote from paragraph 8:

 

"It was plainly the case that all involved were working on the basis that mother would be the hands-on primary care giver to the newborn baby with father being more active in the care of the older children.  The suggestion that [E] had to supervise the mother's care of her baby is not supported by the evidence and in oral evidence [S] was far from clear that emphatic guidance had been given to the father and was plainly not prepared to state with certainty that the conversation father says he had with her about going to work did not occur.  It is submitted that the Local Authority cannot reasonably sustain its position given their own evidence."

S in evidence said that she did not recall saying father could go to work.  It has been suggested that the court should be aware that because of the tragic circumstances, a serious case review was required which may have had some influence on what S recollected as she was the social worker allocated to the case when K died.  I reject that interpretation and I am satisfied and find that whatever latitude there may have been in relation to how father carried out the role of supervising, it did not include the possibility of leaving mother on her own with the care of all three children overnight and I am also satisfied that father knew that in staying out overnight, he had been in breach of what was expected of him.  It seems that father was working quite extensively and I am satisfied that the Local Authority did not know because he had not informed them of just how many hours he spent outside the home and away from the family.  It was incumbent upon him, in accordance with the agreement, to inform the Local Authority of any change in circumstances and any difficulties.  Thus I find this was a significant deceit which did fundamentally undermine the safeguarding plan.  Sadly, therefore, the tragedy occurred which would not have occurred had E been, as was expected of him by the Local Authority, present overnight in the house.

In the days before K's death, the health visitor W reported that she did have some difficulties making contact with the family, both antenatally and following K's birth but that things appeared to be going nicely.  It seems K had not regained her birth weight and there was some difficulty getting her wind up but the health visitor was clear that she had no undue concerns about C and her care of K.  The health visitor was also very clear that she had advised C about the dangers of co-sleeping.  Although in evidence C initially denied that she was told about dangers in co-sleeping, she then accepted that she had been told not to co-sleep and that she knew the risks of so doing.  She maintained that she had not been given the leaflet about it.  I find that C had been told and was well aware of the risks co-sleeping presented and either ignored such risks or, in the circumstances, took the view that such risks were by then irrelevant.

 

There were appointments missed, which mother accepted, and there was a relapse into drug misuse.  Mother took temazepam after K was born, she told the police to help her sleep.  Also, in her police interview, mother said she took amphetamine which someone brought to the house.  In her statement, mother says that she went to her friend's house on the Tuesday before K died.  In her statement at page 232 in the bundle, paragraph 17, mother sets out:

 

"On the Tuesday before K died, I took her round to show her to one of my friends.  My friends offered me some amphetamine, which I took.  Amphetamine did not usually have much effect on me, other than giving me more energy, and I never suffered any come down effect.  I now realise this was irresponsible behaviour when I had K in my care."

Thus it seems there were at least two occasions in the two weeks two days that K was at home that mother took amphetamine.  She also took temazepam and was continuing to take prescribed methadone.  

In her Children Act statement, at paragraph 18, she sets out:

 

"On Thursday - I think it was Thursday - before K died, I had an argument with E about his son [X].  [X] had stayed over at our house on Wednesday night as he often did.  [X] is a difficult teenager who treats the home like a hotel.  [X] never clears up after himself and would help himself to anything out of the cupboards or fridge.  I was really cross that [X] had simply left all of his dirty dishes in the sink for me to wash up.  I was obviously tired because I was the mother of a young baby and I was waking up during the night to ensure she had regular feeds.  I told [E] that he should take [X] back to his home.  It can be seen from the police photographs that I like my kitchen to be kept clean and tidy, particularly because this was where I was preparing K's bottles and medication.  [E] was annoyed with me for telling him to take [X] home and he always accuses me of not liking [X].  I think [E] lets [X] get away with things because he feels guilty that he has not always been there for [X]."

It is apparent from this paragraph that there was an argument, that mother understandably was angry that, as a mother of a new baby who had all the duties and responsibilities involved in looking after a new baby and getting up at night to feed the baby, she was tired and resented, understandably, X, who she said was treating the house like a hotel.  In oral evidence, mother accepted there had been an argument but said she did not tell the police about it because it did not really seem important.  It was about dirty dishes.  She said it was a disagreement.  She was not that annoyed over a few dishes.

The evidence Y gave both to the police and to the court is relevant:

 

"On Thursday, 28th�March, [E] worked a night shift.  After work, we went to his house.  We both went in the house and I stayed at his home on my own whilst he and [C] did the school run and sorted out their daily routine.  Both [C] and [E] returned with [K] at around 9.30am to 10am.  [E] and I had a sleep in the living room until lunchtime.  I remember [E] and [C] began arguing about [E's] grown-up son from a previous relationship [X].  I cannot remember exactly what the argument entailed.  I seem to remember it being something about how [E] got in trouble if he ever tells [A] off.  [A] is [C's] son from a previous relationship and she gives [E] a hard time if he ever tells [A] off.  I got the impression that this had an impact on the argument when [C] was complaining about [X].  As a result of this argument, [E] told me that he and I were to go to the unit and prepare for the evening."

It is clear that the argument was sufficient for Y to note it.  He went on to say within that statement:

"Usually, we would go back to [E's] but he said we were to go back to the unit as he did not want to go home as a result of the argument."

In oral evidence before me, Y described it as, "Not raised voices and yelling, just say tit for tat" and he could hear bits of squabbling going on.  He said he could tell from E's expression that something was up.  He stated that E did not say he had stayed out because of a row but had said something about clearing the air.  

 

It seems likely that there had been a row which was significant for both E and C.  C accepted in evidence that it was significant for both of them and yet she did not tell the police about it.  E did not phone to say he was not coming home.  Apparently, he usually did if he was staying out.  C, in answer to a question, "Why this very night [E] did not tell you he was not going to come home" told the court it was because of the disagreement.

 

C accepted that K had difficulties with wind and that the remedies they had tried, such as Infacol and Dentinox, were not working.  It was put to her that it was a problem which upset and frustrated her.  She replied, "More upset".  Mr L put to C that she was cross, referring to E and the argument and his failure to come home, to which mother responded, "Yes," that she was exhausted, referring to the demands of a tiny baby and one with wind, to which she answered "Yes", but when Mr L put it to her that she lost it, she responded, "Certainly not.  I love my children, all three of them."

 

C gave an account in oral evidence of what occurred during the hours before K's death.  She also, of course, gave an account to the police.  The medical records reveal the account mother gave to the doctors when K was taken to the hospital.  C in court gave an account of what occurred and I read from my notes:

 

"Q.  You woke up at 5am?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Took the time from the television?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Changed the nappy?

A.  Yes.

Q.  There was a dirty nappy and you remembered the oramorph?

A.  Yes, I fed her.  I made up the feed.  I gave her the oramorph first.  I was bottle feeding her.  I would measure the oramorph into the syringe and put the oramorph in the teat of the bottle and let K suck it.  K was in her Moses basket.  I changed her bum and put her back in the Moses basket when I put the kettle on to make the bottle.  I came back in and gave her the oramorph.  If was in a little plastic box.  It took no longer than five minutes.  I put her back in the Moses basket and then made the bottle up.  I put the cold tap on to cool the bottle.  Then I fed her.  I winded her.  I was talking to her for about half an hour after I'd done other things.  I think I fell asleep with her after that.  No longer than half an hour was spent.  I talked to her for half an hour.  It was getting on to 6am. 

I remember A coming down and saying K didn't look right.  When I looked at her, she didn't look right, so I rang the ambulance.  They told me how to give her CPR.  I knew deep down it was too late but I was still trying."

Mrs Z in her submissions on behalf of the guardian sets out and I quote:

 

"Astonishingly, the mother's account of events leading up to [K's] death is of an uneventful evening during which [K] presented normally and gave no cause for concern.  The mother had always been consistent in her account that she had fallen asleep with [K] lying in the crook of her left arm, closest to the back of the sofa, both mother and baby covered with a duvet which did not obstruct the baby's breathing, exactly the same position as when woken by [A].  

This simply cannot be given the post-mortem findings of the full thickness skull fracture 40mm in length and the expert evidence of the force required and mechanism for such an injury to occur.  [K's] death occurred before the body's healing process had time to react.  There was no fibrin formation in the bone.  The underlying bruise had not had time to develop and be visible to the eye and there was no injury to the brain.  [M] considered that it was plausible that the head injury had been sustained within minutes of death and probably less than two hours.  [O] indicated that the presence of hypostasis at 9.12am suggested death had occurred at least an hour or two before, therefore between 7 and 8am."

I accept this submission sets out an overview of the evidence before the court.  I have heard evidence from C and note that her description is detailed and her recollection before she says she fell asleep with K in her arms is very clear.  Thereafter, she says it is blurry.  I do not underestimate the effect the realisation that K was not alive must have had upon the mother.  Thankfully, none of us know what C went through upon the realisation of the death of her daughter and any consideration of mother's recollection or lack of it of what occurred between 6am and 9am must, indeed, be set against that background.  

 

C has always maintained that she has not knowingly caused any harm to K.  Ms H reminds me of the importance of the so-called Lucas direction and I have very much in mind the words of Baker J in Devon County Council v EB & Ors (Minors) [2013] EWHC 968 (Fam) which Ms H sets out within the submissions:

 

"It is not uncommon for witnesses in these cases to tell lies in the course of the investigation and the hearing.  The court must be careful to bear in mind that a witness may lie for various reasons, such as shame, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress and the fact that the witness has lied about some matters does not mean that he or she has lied about everything."

Indeed, I also take into account the evidence of the guardian which Ms H has set out, " mother presents as an emotionally vulnerable adult who has not sought bereavement counselling to assist her both with the loss of her parents, which both she and E identified as remaining a painful and current issue for her.  In my view, her unresolved feelings of loss have been heightened and compounded by her recent sad loss of K under such tragic circumstances."

 

  Both parents are likely to be suffering additional stress due to the very nature of these proceedings and the outcome of any findings made in relation to K.  I also, of course, bear in mind that it is said that mother has a poor memory. 

 

 However, even considering all these matters, it is difficult to reconcile mother's ability to give a very detailed account up until 6am and then for her to be able to recall nothing at all until A woke her at 9am, at which time K was already dead.  Upon mother's account of things, there was nothing at all wrong or untoward as far as her daughter was concerned before 6am when they both went to sleep.  However, at 9am, K was dead with a 40mm full thickness fracture to her head.  Mother, in fact, in evidence, when it was asked of her by Mr L if she still thought that she, mother, had had a fit, said, "Yes, it is the only explanation."  

 

I have heard a number of doctors who are eminent in their own fields and I must consider their evidence, as Ryder J, as he then was, set out in A County Council v A Mother and Others [2005] EWCH (Fam) 31:  

 

"A factual decision must be based on all available materials i.e. be judged in context and not just upon medical or scientific materials, no matter how cogent they may in isolation seem to be."

In a case of this nature before me, the judge is uniquely able to, quoting from Re U, survey the whole landscape.  Charles J, as Ms H refers to in A County Council v KD observed:

 

"It is important to remember that the roles of the court and the expert are distinct and it is the court that is in the position to weigh up the expert evidence against its findings on other evidence.  The judge must always remember that she or he is the person who makes the final decision."

I recognise, of course, that is for me to decide on the facts and medical opinion as presented in the evidence and to recognise also, as Hedley J put it and quoted by Ms H:

 

"In my judgment a conclusion of unknown aetiology in respect of an infant represents neither a provision of professional nor forensic failure.  It simply recognises that we still have much to learn and it also recognises that it is dangerous and wrong to infer non-accidental injury merely from the absence of any other understood mechanism.  Maybe it simply represents a general acknowledgement that we are fearfully and wonderfully made." 

The thrust of the mother's case is set out in the conclusions in the written submissions of Ms H and Ms J presented to the court.

 

"The cause of death in this case remains unknown.  That conclusion does not represent a failure of the forensic process.  Rather more, it is the forensic process at its most rigorous and fair.  Here, the cause of death may be asphyxia caused by the mother overlaying on a sofa stacked at a hazardous angle.  It may be death for the reasons which cause sudden infant death syndrome deaths.  The evidence does not enable the court to make any clear findings, certainly not that death was an immediate or almost instantaneous result of head injury.

The cause of the fracture also remains unknown.  It is inherently unlikely that this mother, who, whatever her faults, loved her baby and was gentle with her would inflict serious injury on her beloved baby.  The extraordinary angle of the sofa and the associated pressure caused by gravity, make a crush injury the likely cause.  Such a crush injury may well have happened while mother was in a deep sleep, unable to know what position she moved in and out whilst asleep."

The court spent considerable time investigating the two speculative explanations which mother put forward.  I remind myself it is not for the mother to prove one or other of them was the cause of the skull fracture or the death but mother advances them as a possible explanation and, thus, they were and should be subject to examination.

 

In relation to the mother having a seizure, Mr L refers to the what he calls "red herring nature" of the seizure explanation.  He sets out:

 

(a) it is not mentioned by mother as a possible explanation during her police interviews on 31st�March or 3rd�April 2013, even though during the latter interview mother was telling the police about her very recent fit and confirmed that she does not suffer from epilepsy; 

(b) it was first raised by father rather than mother on 19th�April 2013; 

(c) it is not mentioned by mother to the police as a possible explanation until 21st�August 2013 and only then at the prompting of mother's solicitor; 

(d) AA, who has known mother for many years and has particular expertise in treating drug addicts, had not considered seizures to be a significant problem for mother and had pointed to a gap of at least seven years during which no seizures had been reported; 

(e) T, who has a similar close and longstanding involvement with mother, confirmed in evidence that mother had never spoken to her about the fits.

I accept all those matters as being relevant in consideration of the explanation that the injury could have been caused by mother taking a fit.  Perhaps, however, it is BB's evidence, the consultant neurosurgeon, which is most relevant and convincing.  His opinion is that C does not suffer from epilepsy but it seems that she does suffer some sort of seizures which are psychologically or likely to be psychologically determined.  They appear to occur at times of stress.  He was clear:

 

"(1) if she had a seizure, she would be awake when it started;

(2) she would be aware that she had had a seizure;

(3) he said, "I think people all always know that they had a seizure afterwards";

(4) "I cannot exclude the remote possibility she had a seizure but there is no evidence she did and I think it is most unlikely she did."

Ms H submits at paragraph 77 of her submissions:

 

"It is also important to take into account the fact that her seizures are followed by drowsiness.  She could have woken, had a seizure of which she recalls nothing, to be followed by drowsiness and a return to sleep."

Taking BB's evidence as a whole, I find that it is unlikely that C had a fit but, if she did, it is more likely that any seizure would occur when she was awake and that she would be aware of it even if it was followed by drowsiness and then a return to sleep.  She would know if she had had a seizure.  The possibility that she had a seizure and somehow, in flailing around, caused K's skull fracture and that mother was unaware of what had happened is not supported by the evidence which I have heard and, upon the balance of probability, does not explain the skull fracture.

 

Another possibility put forward by C is that the head injury was caused by crushing or overlaying.  The experts at their meeting on 25th�November 2013 agreed that the fracture is probably the end result of trauma, whether accidental or non-accidental, and that while a crushing mechanism could not be completely excluded, it was extremely unlikely.  The much more likely mechanism was a rapid blow with a hard object.  The views of the doctors at the experts' meeting bear consideration and are set out at E13 1 within the bundle.  The transcript sets out:

 

"The next question is: to what extent do the experts favour crushing as a possible or probable mechanism for the fracture?"

O responds:

"It is the same answer, really, that statistically this injury is usually the end result of a baby's head being bashed against something but if you accept the mother's or the court accepts the mother's version of events, that was, well, they went asleep to the sofa and you ask the question, 'could This injury be the result of crushing?' then I think the answer has to be, 'Yes'.

N: Again, I agree with [O].  I think particularly in this case in the context of being on a sofa, particularly the way the sofa was edged up at front, creates a particularly hazard sleeping environment and I think with regard to section (d) of the question... I think this needs to be considered also as a possible cause of injury or the fracture.

M:  Yes, I think we've got three possibilities here, (d(1), (2) and (e).  Whilst, you know, I'm sure [O] is right, I think everything points rather more towards a very rapid blow against or with a hard object, rather than a sort of slow crushing type of injury leading to this fracture and the lack of any underlying brain problem.  So, yes, it's a possibility but, like [O], I think it's... in terms of probability, it's much less probable than either (1) or (2)... sorry, (d)(1) and (2).

O:  Essentially, my position... I mean the other thing that I don't like for it being pressure is the amount of bruising that was present, so I think, you know, that in addition... that in addition points to it being a blow or an impact of some sort but I couldn't exclude the possibility that it is crushing.

P:  I think there are three things here, isn't it?  There's the bruise, the fracture and the underlying brain and I think, putting all of those three things together, it seems to me much more likely to be a blow either of the head against something or something against the head but I agree with [O]: you cannot completely exclude this due to crushing."

M said:

 

"And, as we said earlier regarding the pliability of an infant of this age, still I think that would tend to favour [and he is referring to the impact injury]."

P comes back and says:

"I agree with the comment just made.  There's a tilt in favour of impact rather than crush."

It is clear that the doctors together considered very carefully the possibilities and weighed up the various facts of which they were aware and came to a conclusion that the cause of the injury is more likely to be a blow to the head.  The oral evidence of each expert confirmed the position that while crushing was not impossible, it was much less probable than a blow.  O reiterated his view that crushing was less likely because of the degree of bruising and, in his oral evidence, P stated:

 

"The absence of brain injury did lead to consideration of the significant possibility of crush injury, yes, on the information made available to me, child sleeping with the mother, and in that context it needed some serious consideration whether that mechanism could cause an injury like that."

N said he was not aware of any case where there was overlaying and a skull fracture in his experience.  O's only experience of a skull fracture being caused by overlay or crushing was an account of a mother falling downstairs and landing on top of her child.  The pliability of a young infant's skull militates against crushing causing the fracture and, as P stated at the experts' meeting and as referred to by O, if you are lying on your left-hand side, the right side is closer to you than the left.  There was nothing at all on the right side but her head.  He said it was within the realms of common sense.

 

The experts, as is their duty, considered matters extremely carefully.  If the mother's consistent account of the baby's position in her arms is correct, then the skull fracture is on the wrong side for the crushing to have caused the skull fracture.  Further, mother in her police interview, as she accepted in evidence, was at pains to point out that there had been little risk of overlaying.  The sofa was leather.  There was a duvet between it and the mother.  K was lying on mother's left arm.  She was able to breathe.  A's description of mother and K does not suggest overlaying or, indeed, asphyxia.  

 

The issue of the angle of the sofa was considered and Ms H refers in her submission to the exceptional nature of the sofa.  I accept that for some unidentified reason the sofa was at an angle of 18 to 20 degrees.  Ms H submits it has to be factored into a real appraisal of this case.  N said it was the first time he had come across a scenario where the baby was sleeping on an angled surface.  He said co-sleeping on a sofa was recognised as a hazard and with a slope, by common sense, it made it more hazardous.

 

Having full regard to all the evidence, including the angle of the sofa, the angle of the sofa does not alter my view that overlaying or asphyxia is improbable as a cause of the fracture.

 

Mr L points to the fact that mother was obviously struggling, in that she had care of three children, including a newborn baby.  I do not doubt that K was a much loved baby and welcomed by the mother.  However, she was demanding, as all new babies are.  She needed treatment for withdrawal symptoms, although it seems that that was not a particular concern, but she did have severe wind.  Mother, on her own account, was clearly upset by it and described it as "horrible to watch".  Father had left mother to cope on her own, not just on this occasion but on other occasions when he went to work.  Revealingly, mother had lapsed into drug misuse, amphetamine and temazepam.  She said she needed the latter to help her sleep.  However, she was, of course, also, as she set out in her statement, tired and complaining of lack of sleep.  There was dissension between mother and father the previous evening.  Y describes an argument, despite both mother and father playing down the importance of it.  Mother was left overnight without any communication from father as to what he was doing.  Apparently, he would usually phone and let mother know.  It is not a comfortable picture.  

 

I do not speculate as to exactly what occurred.  I do not know exactly what occurred.  The mother does.  It is not, I repeat, for the mother to prove how it occurred.  Nor does the fact that I rely on overlaying as improbable mean that it was non-accidental.  However, taking all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the most likely explanation for the skull fracture was the infliction of a rapid and forceful blow against or with a hard object.  K was immobile and just 3 weeks old.  There is, I find, no other plausible explanation for the skull fracture and there is no suggestion of anyone else being involved or any other intervening events.  C must know what occurred, even if she is unable or unwilling to face the reality of it.  I find that the injury was non-accidental injury and it was caused by C.

 

The medical experts agreed at the meeting on 25th�November 2013 that the skull fracture and the overlying bruise were probably the result of the same trauma.  As O said, it is just common sense, in that the fracture was smack in the middle of the bruise.  The medical evidence in relation to when the head injury was sustained placed the likely timeframe as within six hours of death and probably much closer.  This was agreed at the experts' meeting when the experts agreed, when it was put to them, that the fracture was probably sustained within minutes or less than six hours before death.  M stated at that meeting:

 

"The amount of bleeding that I saw makes me think, and the absence of any fibrin at all makes me think, that this was much closer to... the interval between fracture and death was much less than six hours but it's just that, you know, it would be very easy for someone to come along and say, 'Well, can you be certain of that?  Can you give me a much more accurate timing?' and the answer is not it's within six hours but, in all probability, much closer to the time of death than six hours."

In oral evidence, M stated that, in relation to the time of death, based upon the absence of the formation of fibrin, that you usually see fibrin in two hours and that it must have formed within twelve hours, it is probably less than two hours and almost certainly less than six hours.  He agreed that it was perfectly plausible that the event happened within minutes of death.  He said such scenario was entirely plausible.  M agreed that he did not know what effect the oramorph which K was taking would have upon the production of fibrin.

 

While I accept there are features in the pathology which are consistent with asphyxia and with whatever causes sudden infant death syndrome, neither on the evidence before me are likely.  N in oral evidence said it would never be possible to classify the death as a SIDS death because of the skull fracture, although mother did have some of the risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome, in that she took drugs, but he said sudden infant death syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

 

I also take note of what CC said at E163, paragraph 50, in relation to drug users:

 

"The mothers in the two groups differed in other ways.  Those using methadone tend to present late for antenatal care, arrive for delivery unbooked and are more likely to smoke during pregnancy and their infants present with poor foetal growth.  The fact that maternal methadone use is associated with a higher infant mortality does not, therefore, mean that methadone causes sudden infant death syndrome."

Further, I find it is inherently improbable that having sustained a non-accidental fracture to her skull, within two hours or less K suffered an entirely unrelated death from SIDS.  

 

In his report at E110b, O sets out:

 

"Thus, a full and detailed post-mortem examination, including histology, toxicology and three specialist options has failed to provide a definite explanation for [K's] death.  Specifically, there was no evidence that she died as a result of poisoning, with the toxicology being essentially negative; no natural disease was identified that might have caused or contributed to the death by way of, for example, congenital disease or infection; and the only injury present, a large bruise under the scalp with a related skull fracture, was not accompanied by any significant damage to the brain and, therefore, does not provide a definite explanation for death.  [P's] report should be consulted for the detail but whilst head injury could explain death, the usual types of abnormality seen to the brain and surrounding membranes in fatal head injuries in children were not present.  It is well recognised that infants of [K's] age can simply be found dead in the morning and that a full and detailed post-mortem examination may not provide an explanation for death.  In these circumstances, the label 'sudden infant death syndrome' is applied.  While such a mechanism of death could explain [K's] death, by convention the label 'sudden infant death syndrome' is not applied when features such as significant injury are evident."

He concludes, therefore, that as far as he, the pathologist is concerned, the cause of K's death remains unascertained.

The oral evidence of M and O confirmed the medical view that the closer in time the infliction of the skull fracture to the death, then the more likely the death was caused by the skull fracture.  The medical experts are unable to say with absolute certainty, other than that it was within six hours of the skull fracture occurring.  All thought probably less than two hours and M said that it was entirely plausible that the event happened within minutes of death.  O was also of the view that it was plausible the fracture occurred within minutes of death.  P said the head injury as a cause of death was entirely plausible if the death happened within minutes of the fracture.

 

Mother said that at or about 6am, when she went to sleep, there was no injury to K's skull.  At 9am, there was a fracture and K was dead.  However, no reliance can be placed on mother's account of matters and there is no other evidence or witness as to what occurred during these hours.

 

P discussed that there was no evidence of traumatic injury to the brain or spinal cord which could be explained if death occurred very quickly and there was insufficient time for the brain to swell.  If there was a period of survival, he said, one would expect the brain to swell significantly.  N accepted that the nearer in time the skull fracture to the time of death, the more likely it was that it was the cause of death.  He went on to say that is common sense but accepted it was beyond his expertise.

 

The experts, in giving evidence, confined themselves to the medical findings and were cautious about attributing death to the skull fracture.  O remained of the view that the cause of death was unascertained from a medical point of view, as did N.  However, taking all the evidence which the court has and on the balance of probabilities, I find that it is likely that death occurred as a direct result of the injuries to the head.  DD, consultant paediatrician, in evidence said that babies usually cry out at the time their skull is fractured and that they may cry for a short time after this.  However, it is recognised that, after the initial break, this area does not appear to be particularly painful because the broken edges cannot move.  Bearing in mind, on mother's account, the proximity of mother and K, it is unlikely that if K did cry out, the mother had not heard her.  

 

It is not possible because of the lack of a credible account as to what happened from the mother to determine any further what actually occurred.  The scenario as recounted by the mother, however, I find is improbable.

 

Ms H queries would this mother have gone to sleep with a dead or dying baby in her arms?  I accept that when seen by the ambulance man, mother appeared upset and genuinely distressed but I can do no more than repeat only C knows what actually did happen in the time leading up to K's death.  I have made the findings which I have upon the evidence which is available to me and I find that evidence is sufficient to support the findings which I make.

 

Findings are sought in relation to father's drug misuse and his alleged non-cooperation with court approved enquiries into his drug taking and medical history.  The father has a documented history of drug misuse.  Father was convicted of drug offences in 2002 but insisted, in these proceedings, he had not used drugs for years.  C's evidence would contradict this assertion.  She set out in her December statement at C227:

 

"For many years, [E] has used amphetamine.  When we were living together with the children, he would take the amphetamine every day.  [E] knew that drug testing would reveal his amphetamine use and this is why he shaved his hair, so that testing could not take place.  I assume that [E] is not using amphetamine now because he knows that he is going to have another drug test."

In oral evidence, C, as Mr L put it, backtracked and said it was a couple of years ago that father had used it every day.  Her oral evidence, actually, was contradictory of her written evidence but C would not accept that she was lying in either her statement or oral evidence.  I have already found C to be untruthful.  Therefore, her evidence cannot be relied upon in relation to this issue any more than any other issue.  However, she does now support the children residing with father, which was not the position when she signed her statement.

 

Father's account was that it was more than a year ago since he smoked cannabis and more than two years since he had amphetamine.  He says, although he was referred to the doctor for drug use, he did not go because it was not a problem.  E's medical history reveals difficulties that he has had at times with stress, anxiety and depression as well as drug misuse.

 

The court wished to have an up-to-date drug test.  Father shaved his body hair.  He said it was something he was in the habit of doing and vehemently denies that he did so to avoid the results of an up-to-date drug test being obtained.  C said in evidence sometimes he did shave his body hair.  Photographs were produced to the court to show previous occasions when he had shaved his body hair.  In her statement, C said:

 

"[E] knew drug testing would reveal his amphetamine use and this is why he shaved his hair, so testing could not take place.  I assume [E] is not using amphetamine now because he knows he is going to have another drug test."

I remind myself that C is unreliable and that other matters in that statement of 10th�December are disputed.  Further, Miss F submits that having gone to such lengths to evade hair strand testing, it makes no sense to then provide a sample knowing amphetamine would be revealed.

 

The expert evidence in this regard recognised the possibility that E could have either ingested amphetamine unknowingly at his work at the nightclub or through contamination at home.  There is no evidence of E being observed by any of the professionals at any time to be under the influence of drugs.

 

I approach E's evidence about the drug test with some caution and scepticism.  The hair strand test which was eventually obtained was positive for amphetamine.  In his statement on 4th�December 2013, E stated:

 

"Right from the outset, I have made it clear to everybody involved in the case that I will provide a hair strand test, blood, urine, drugs samples, whatever."

Yet he continued to shave his body hair even after the court direction was made on 5th�July.  It is difficult to reach any conclusion other than he wished to avoid testing.  The expert evidence to which I have referred allows for the possibility of contamination but the explanations put forward by E of contamination by finishing off drinks in a nightclub would require, according to the expert, very regular contact with contaminated drinks and otherwise contamination would be by direct contact between hand and hair.  It is possible but I find unlikely.

I accept E was very much against mother's drug taking and father's use of drugs is not and does not seem in the past to ever have developed into the sort of problem that mother has had.  It is father's credibility and capacity for frankness which is largely the concern of the court around this matter.

 

In the same statement, that is 10th�December 2013, C raises for the first time that E was violent towards her and that she was scared when he shouted at her.  She sets out:

 

"I can remember two occasions during my relationship with [E] when he has been physically violent towards me.  On one occasion, when I was having a disagreement with [E], he kicked me in the face while wearing his steel-cap boots.  [A], who was little saw, this incident and was very distressed.  I sustained a black eye as a result of this.  There was another occasion when [E] slapped me across the face.  As a result of these incidents, I am quite scared of [E] when he shouts at me.  [E] has never raised his hands to [A] or [B] and he knows I would never allow that to happen."

In oral evidence, C reduced the allegation of physical violence to one occasion.  C said, in fact, she could not remember E slapping her across the face at all, despite the fact that she gave oral evidence only four weeks after the date of the statement.  She maintains, however, that the incident with the boot did happen when A was 3 or 4 and it was not an accident.  She maintains she was scared of E when he shouts.  E denies he has ever been physically violent to C and that the incident years ago when he was kicking off his work boot was an accident.  C maintained her account in oral evidence in respect of the boot incident but although it seems something did happen, I cannot determine that it was deliberate.  C's evidence has been found to be unreliable in many regards.

 

The relationship between C and E has been for many years volatile and inconsistent.  It has not been a violent relationship.  E, following upon K's death, was, no doubt, distraught.  He indicated an intention to separate from mother on 19th�April 2013, when he spoke to the social worker, and he confirmed it in his position statement for the hearing on 5th�July 2013.  An email from his solicitors on 29th�October 2013 confirmed his position.  However, at the start of the hearing, both C and E were still living in the same house.

 

Mother's position statement for 5th�July 2013 said quite the opposite to father's and the guardian was of the view on 2nd�December 2013 that C had only just found out about father's intention to separate.  Father told the court he had made it clear to the mother in October their future did not lie together.  There have been numerous occasions in the past when mother and father have separated, only to reconcile at a later date.  It seems that even after July, the sexual relationship continued, until, on E's account, C renewed her contact with DD, someone whom she had known for some time.  C maintained that the relationship with DD was a friendship only.  Both parents agreed that the last time they had sexual intercourse was October.  E accepted that his behaviour could be interpreted as giving mixed messages to C.

 

It is, in my view, difficult to assess just what happens when a longstanding relationship is brought to an end, particularly when both parties are dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy which they have both sustained.  It has been apparent to everyone involved with C just how vulnerable she is and E has known her all her life and been extremely close to her.  It perhaps needed the recognition that C was making serious allegations against him of deceit and violence to prompt him to take the steps to move out.  E went to see C on Christmas Day and they have spent some time together since.  In all the circumstances, I find it is unsurprising that E went to see C on Christmas Day and, in some ways, it demonstrates that he has a care for her.  Christmas Day must have been an extremely difficult time for both of them.  It seems the relationship is not ongoing presently but the permanence of the separation remains to be tested.

 

I heard evidence from the contact supervisor in relation to contact.  Taken as a whole, contact was positive and both E and C have demonstrated, and I have no doubt of, their great love for their children.  They have both been committed to contact.  It does not seem to me necessary to pick over the detail of individual contacts.  It seems to be the case that the parents found contact more difficult when EE was the supervisor.  However, taking contact as a whole over a lengthy period of time with many contacts and set against a very difficult background, contact has been positive for both these children.  

 

Both B and A want to go home to their family but that, of course, is not possible.  C has recognised that she cannot care for the children at this stage.  The guardian told the court this step by the mother was important in regard for the children.  It is submitted on behalf of the father that it would be disproportionate to make final care orders and, as I have mentioned, Miss F submits that the plans are fundamentally flawed.  Father seeks to have an assessment not only in relation to his ability to care for the children in the near future but, alternatively, if he was not caring for them, the progress of contact.  

 

Although A and B's wishes have not been ascertained against the background of the separation and mother's inability to care for them, it is unlikely that determining their wishes set against the background of this case would make a significant difference to the outcome.  Although, of course, it does not follow that because he has made some errors in the past, long-term foster care rather than residing with father must be the outcome for A and B, the history cannot be ignored.  There is a considerable amount of evidence before the court.  The ability of the father to provide physical care is accepted and I have mentioned at various stages that the children's circumstances improved when father was involved in their care.  It is his commitment to being a full-time father and his ability to prioritise the needs of the children which give rise to concern.  Father shares responsibility for the chronic neglect of A and B and although he has expressed regret about the past, I am not  satisfied he fully appreciates his role in it or recognises his shortcomings in that regard.  In oral evidence, he was still very keen to emphasise that the neglect of the children had happened largely when he was not there.  

 

An overview of all the evidence does not inspire confidence that E can make and sustain all the necessary changes which would be required of him to provide full-time care to these children.  These children have undergone inconsistency and unpredictability in their lives.  E had not been a consistent figure in their lives until shortly before the birth and death of K.  They have sustained the trauma of the death of their sister, the break-up of their family and their removal into foster care.  They are needy children, as summarised in the parenting assessment.  They need to have their future decided.

 

If, having reviewed the evidence, there was a reasonable prospect that father could take over their care in the immediate future, it may have been worth undertaking an assessment to see what help and assistance he may have required but I am conscious that a move to their father which could not be sustained and broke down would be catastrophic for these children.  

 

It is not possible to ignore the mother's role in the children's future.  She will continue to have contact to the children.  The reaction of the parents to the judgment is unknown, but I am satisfied C does have the capacity to undermine father's care of the children.  She would find it difficult to accept the children were with father and she could only have supervised contact.  I base this view on the knowledge gained of mother through her evidence and through the written evidence before me, which is substantial.  It is not so long since the mother was saying she would prefer the children to be in foster care rather than being with father.  She said that she said this when she was upset and angry but it cannot be ruled out that she may well be upset and angry at times in the future.  In answer to a question from Mrs Z on behalf of the guardian, mother was asked whether her view now was that the children were better with E.  C's answer was yes, until she sorted herself out.  C's response to the following question, "If you sort yourself out?" was, "Hopefully, the children would be back home."  I find this response on behalf of the mother to be revealing as to the way she would approach the children being with father.

 

E seems to have an over optimistic view of his ability to manage not only the children but also C.  He told me, when asked if he thought C would accept the children living with him, "Yes, because, in care, she would get less contact."  E's view, I find, is perhaps over simplistic.  

 

It is to his credit that father prefers to be in work and, in evidence, he talks about reducing his hours to 30 rather than 40 hours a week if he had the children.  Whether he would be able to work even at a reduced level and meet the children's needs is, in my view, questionable.  It seems from father's medical records and father's responses in evidence that albeit some time ago, lack of money arising from not working caused the father stress and anxiety which necessitated attendance at the doctor's.  

 

The guardian submits there are many imponderables which militate against the father being able to care for the children at this stage.  I find that such imponderables would not be remedied by reason of an assessment.  It the passage of time and response of both the mother and father to the changed circumstances and to the judgment which will inform as to whether father can provide safety, security and consistency which A and B need.  This will take some time and consideration.

 

The children need their future to be settled.  A in December was desperate to know what was to happen for the future.  The Local Authority and The guardian argue that there is a pressing need for final orders.  It is, of course, the welfare of both A and B which is my paramount concern.  I must look at the position for the future realistically.  Clearly, there are weighty arguments and benefits to a child being brought up by a parent and if such an outcome can meet the needs of the child, the court will look no further.  However, I am satisfied for the reasons set out within this judgment that there is too much that is uncertain in such an option for A and B and for the court to be confident that their needs would be met.  The delay which would be occasioned by further assessment is not justifiable.  I am, of course, conscious of the requirement set out in Re BS to look at all the options which are available and, in my view, having considered all the options, care by either of the parents cannot meet the needs of these children.

 

As far as contact is concerned, for the father, I do find there is scope to look at contact once the children are settled following them learning about the judgment, the parental separation, possibly for A his true paternity, although that will have to be handled very carefully and, in my view, unless A himself raises it, caution should be exercised as to timing, bearing in mind the changes that A will have to cope with in the near future.  There will need to be careful monitoring and review of contact.  The progress to unsupervised contact for the father and consideration of overnight contact must be left to the discretion of the Local Authority.

 

The mother accepts her contact must be supervised and, similarly, the level of contact for mother must be for the discretion of the Local Authority.  It very much depends upon the reactions of the children to what they are told in relation to this matter and, in this case, as in many others, it is impossible to predict just what effect the knowledge that they are not returning to the care of either of their parents will have upon the children.  It is, in my view, their reaction which needs to be carefully monitored and for the Local Authority to make appropriate contact arrangements thereupon.  The Local Authority have a statutory duty to consider contact.  There is a good relationship presently between the parents and FF, the social worker, and I deem it unnecessary and inappropriate for the court to remain involved to oversee the Local Authority's handling of contact.  The updated contact plan of 16th�January 2014 represents careful thought and envisages ongoing assessment, particularly in relation to the father.  I would hope that there can be a moving towards a level of contact which is in line with the children's best interests and their wishes.

 

Thus I make the care orders in relation to both children and approve the care plan, expressing the view that I hope that it is possible that A and B can remain in their present foster placement, where, it seems, A certainly was happy to remain, of course only if he could not go home.

The mother of all of the children is AB. The father of X and Y is CD and Z's father is EF. Both fathers share parental responsibility for their children with the mother. The other significant people in this case are GH and HH, the paternal aunt of X and Y and her partner, who are currently caring for X and Y. I should say at the outset of this judgment at times I have referred to �the parents� meaning AB and EF. I confess this is for my ease due to the need to prepare an anonymised version of this judgment for publication and I mean no disrespect to CD in his role as father of X and Y which I obviously acknowledge. Looking at the chronology, there were concerns about the family from when X was very small when the mother was in a relationship with CD. Looking at the chronology there were concerns about the home in which they were living, issues of cannabis use, and issues of domestic violence in their relationship. The local authority was involved under a CAF and stepped down their involvement in April 2012, whilst noting there were still some outstanding issues.  The local authority�s involvement with AB and EF began in August 2012 after a referral was made to Children�s Social Care by AB�s midwife expressing concern that she was in a relationship with EF, a man with a known history of violence. In response to the referral, a pre-birth assessment was completed and the children were made the subjects of child protection plans in January 2013, followed by the PLO process in March 2013. As part of the child protection planning, it was recommended that EF attend the W Project to manage his emotional regulation. He attended one session but the service was unable to work with him as he stated that he did not have any issues with anger. Over the period of time the local authority carried out this work EF was in work full time working very long days. There are references in the recordings to EF not having as full involvement as would normally be expected as a result of his work.  Local authority involvement with the family continued with the intensive family support team undertaking work within the home to improve routines and boundaries, and domestic violence services did some work with AB. A psychological assessment was also carried out on behalf of the local authority by a child psychologist, Larry Anderson, looking at attachments within the family unit. The assessment by Mr Anderson, which involved both parents, was positive and reports from nursery suggested that the children�s behaviour had stabilised. Given the progress made the children were removed from child protection plans and PLO on 16 and 18 September 2013, with the situation to remain monitored on a Child In Need basis. It is clear from the minutes of a PLO meeting on 20 March 2013 that the plan had always been to put in intensive family support and then to pull this out and see if the family could sustain the improvements. I am not entirely sure when but around this time EF ceased to work, due to being depressed, and became part of daily life in the family home.  Within a matter of weeks the local authority began to receive further referrals that were of concern. A referral to a children's centre for the mother to access activities and courses was closed down on 2 October as they had not been able to gain contact with the family. Then on 5 October Z was taken to A & E by ambulance, and both ambulance staff and hospital staff were very concerned by EF�s aggression towards both staff and AB. The local authority visited the family home on 10 October and have what seems to been a difficult discussion with the couple, EF suggesting that Social Care could not just turn up. They were not able to elicit from EF whether he was in fact still working although the social worker said they wanted to try to offer support.  On 22 October an anonymous referral was made to the NSPCC stating that EF shouted at the children and that both they and AB were scared of him, as well as allegations that EF was selling drugs from the family home. Again the local authority visited to talk to EF. The following day there was a discussion with school who were expressing increasing concerns regarding X who was having frequent periods off school and Y off nursery. When they tried to discuss this with EF he was argumentative and rude.  Then on 24 October Y�s nursery made a further referral reporting bruising on Y. A section 47 investigation was undertaken and a child protection medical noted a large number of bruises, many accepted to be accidental but including bruising to the face that appeared to be from a grip hold and further bruising to the torso and groin. The only explanation given by AB or EF was the children play fighting or Y being clumsy. The parents� response to the local authority investigating was to accuse them of harassment, of seeking to psych them out, failing to tell them what the concerns are and failing to offer any support. The parents were told that care proceedings would be initiated. The following day EF contacted the department complaining about the team manager and requesting a change of worker. The local authority decided as a result of the escalating concerns to put matters before the court. On 29 October 2013 an application was made for interim care orders in respect of all three children, those orders being made for the first time on 6 November 2013 and having been renewed regularly ever since. The children were removed from the care of the parents. X and Y live with their paternal aunt and her partner, in respect of whom a positive special guardianship assessment has subsequently been completed. Z is in foster care. AB and EF have contact with X and Y three times a week, supervised at a local family centre, and five times a week with Z. CD sees X and Y once a fortnight, supervision alternating between his sister and a contact worker.  These proceedings first came before me on 13 November when directions were given including the instruction of the psychologist who assessed the parents. Drug and alcohol testing was also directed. The case was timetabled through to this final hearing at that point and the only hearing since has been the issues resolution hearing.  The local authority has filed a recent amended schedule of findings sought but the question of threshold has not been agreed. I shall therefore return to this later in this judgment. I remind myself that the question of threshold has to be looked at as at the date protective measures were instituted, which I take here to be the issue of proceedings.   The Issues and the Position of the Parties  In preparing for this hearing I have read the full bundle of papers provided to me in this matter, as well as certain documents handed in during the hearing including a letter from GH and HH, X's school attendance record, a social work summary prepared for a review conference on 18 September 2013 and the social worker�s notes of a conversation with staff at The substance misuse project as well as a letter from them regarding EF. I have heard evidence in court from the social work team manager, Helen Cliffe; IJ, acting head teacher at X's school; Dr Naomi Murphy, a forensic psychologist who assessed AB and EF; AB; EF; and Diane Andre-Brown, the guardian. I have also heard submissions from all parties. The local authority has assessed AB and EF. Ms Cliffe concluded it would not be in the interests of any of the children to return to the care of the couple. In respect of X and Y, the assessment of the paternal aunt and her partner was positive and the local authority recommend special guardianship orders to be made in their favour. The local authority also proposes the making of supervision orders for twelve months to support the placement, particularly in relation to contact. Assessments of another paternal aunt and a family friend were negative and there are no possible family options for Z. The local authority plan for him therefore is the making of a care and placement order with a plan that he be placed for adoption. Their plans are supported by the guardian.  AB and EF oppose the plans for all three children and wish them to be returned to their care. They do not accept that the children have suffered any harm in their care or would be at risk of suffering harm in the future. They take the view the local authority has always been set against them and was not open to the possibility of them caring for the children. They make the point that as recently as early September 2013 the local authority stepped down its involvement as it was content with the children's progress, only to seek interim care orders the following month. CD does not oppose the making of special guardianship orders in respect of X and Y to their carers. He does not seek to care for the children himself and is confident they will be well cared for by his sister and her partner. His contact only restarted in January 2014 following a breakdown in arrangements after a private law contact order was made. His contact has been going successfully on a fortnightly basis since it resumed. The plan is for his contact to be reduced to six times a year in school holidays. He would have liked to have more contact than that but is content to leave matters in the hands of his sister. He would be concerned if X and Y returned to the care of their mother and EF as he fears his contact will break down again.  The Evidence  The local authority's case was set out in the evidence of Helen Cliffe. She is a team manager and currently has responsibility for this family. As I understand it she also supervised other workers who had some involvement during the period where the local authority worked with this family under Child Protection Plans. She prepared the initial evidence for the court when care proceedings were commenced including the assessment of the parents. She spoke of the deterioration since the stepped down plan. She spoke of her concerns that X and Y did not react as one would expect when the parents were highly aroused, seeming to be used to this. X�s school attendance had dropped to 75% and Y had had spates of reported sickness leading to her missing nursery. The local authority was concerned at the dysfunctional family dynamics and the aggression. Ms Cliffe was clear that for her the case is not one of capability. In her written and oral evidence she acknowledged the parents had given good parenting at times and she did not seek to resile from the progress of the family shown in the very positive assessment by Larry Anderson. She said in her initial statement : �The Child Protection planning and the Public Law Outline process for the nine-month period it was in place clearly evidences parental capacity to provide the children with what is expected. This is a matter of sustainability and the parents recognising their own risk factors in parenting their respective children and proactively engaging with services in times of stress. The history of each parent's respective parenting is extensive. The cyclical nature of chaotic parenting places all three children at ongoing risk of significant harm�.� In her oral evidence she was clear that whatever services were put in place the risk of harm would return if the children were in the care of the parents. What was also clear from the local authority's initial evidence was that it took the view that further assessment of the parents should not take place. The plan was for assessments of family members but if not placement outside the family. Hair strand testing of the parents in relation to drug and alcohol use was also sought. This approach was consistent with the way local authorities are now told to �front load� care cases but I accept the message it gave to the parents was that the local authority had made up its mind. However at the first hearing before me the local authority agreed to update its assessments, an approach requested by the guardian, and also agreed to the guardian's proposal for forensic psychological assessments of AB and EF.  Looking at Ms Cliffe�s final statement, in that she very much reflected on the evidence which had been gathered since the beginning of the proceedings when reaching a final conclusion. She placed understandable emphasis on Dr Murphy's assessment of the parents and the result of the drug and alcohol testing and she looked at the evidence from the updated parenting assessment and contact as well. She acknowledged that the parents had taken steps to put in hand some of the matters raised by Dr Murphy. However she remained of the view that the children could not be returned to the care of AB and EF. I should say I found Ms Cliffe a considered witness, open and thoughtful in her evidence. It is certainly clear to me that the relationship Ms Cliffe had with the parents was a difficult one, something she acknowledged. In her oral evidence she said she would not underestimate the impact of the involvement of Social Care on the parents given that they both had a history with the agency. She said she had tried hard to research particularly EF's background in advance of them first meeting for his assessment as she knew his childhood would be an issue for him. It was also very clear that she had made an active choice to minimise social work involvement and use independent agencies such as the intensive family support team and Larry Anderson. Whilst tailoring the service to this family she says said there did still have to be certain things which were social work led such as meetings. She felt that they had done everything they could to put in services in an appropriate way. She said she would have no confidence in the future that the parents would work with the local authority, despite what they had said. Ms Cliffe was concerned about the impact on X and Y in particular of the care they had experienced. She spoke of how she felt they struggled to regulate their emotions which could impact on their ability to function and to access services around education. She felt this was improving in the care of their current carers although it was still an issue. I learned more about the children from the statements from their nursery and schools. IJ, the acting head teacher at X�s school, gave evidence as well as filing a statement. He explained how X�s school attendance in the first part of September prior to the meeting on 18 September was 100%. He was very clear that matters changed significantly after that meeting. In court he gave me a copy of the attendance record which showed a significant change in terms of attendance and late arrivals from that point onwards, with attendance dropping to 75%. He spoke of absences due to coughs, colds and diarrhoea, an optician�s appointment for which no letter was produced, as well as late attendance. In passing I should say the mother in her evidence said children had to be off school if they had diarrhoea for forty eight hours thereafter but I note the absences due to diarrhoea seem to have been single days. It was put to IJ that children coming up from nursery often get bugs. IJ accepted that but said he would still view 95% as acceptable attendance. He said even children with no experience of nursery and just starting in school would not have attendance as low as this, even if they had had a significant illness like chickenpox. On 17 October X was late for school, the explanation being that the baby was sick over him and he had to get changed. On arrival X said he had not had breakfast and said EF had been shouting at him and his mother. On 25 October there was another incident of concern. On that day IJ said EF dropped X off at school. He said when X arrived he was very agitated, hyper-vigilant and appeared scared by EF's presence. After EF left X needed comforting and reassuring. His teacher said to X �E is gone now� and X calmed down. X told his teacher the police and social workers had visited the house night before and EF was �fighting with them�. He went on to say he had not had breakfast that morning as his mother and EF were shouting. Puzzlingly, EF accepted he had taken X that morning whereas AB protested there had never been a morning when EF had done the drop off, clearly not the truth. It left me with no confidence at all when she then said there was never a time she and EF had shouted at each other.  Overall IJ said X was an anxious child who needed more adult support and attention. He accepted children who had come from a different nursery needed more attention anyway but X�s needs were still more significant. He said X was behind expectations in most areas, particularly making relationships and also managing feelings and behaviour.  Looking at the statement of KL, Y's nursery nurse practitioner, she too talked about Y's absence from nursery, including I note 30 September. On that date neither child went to school. X's attendance record shows him off school sick whereas Y was off because her mother was waiting for a washing machine to be delivered. Y missed nursery from 16 to 23 October, six days spread over a weekend, due to being unwell. KL said it was unusual because Y would not normally miss so much. Then on 24 October Y was brought in by her mother who quickly said she had a bruise on her chin due to falling off her bed having been wrestling with her brother. She said the social worker had already seen it, which I know is true. When KL looked closely at Y she found a number of injuries on her face and torso. She was so concerned Y's social worker was asked to come to the nursery and Y was taken for a medical. KL is someone who also knew X because he had been at the same nursery. She said in her statement to the children did sometimes hit each other at nursery but that Y was no clumsier than any other child and bruising had not been noticed before. She said in her statement �I found that the children found it difficult to express their anger and if something went wrong they would shout, rant and rave and be louder than most children.� Also amongst the local authority�s evidence were contact notes as well as a collective statement from four workers at the family centre where Z�s contact takes place. They noticed a number of contacts with Z missed or ended early, EF having missed quite a few more than AB. He had also missed a significant proportion of X and Y�s contacts. It is clear from the notes and the statement that both parents were capable of looking after Z practically but concerns were raised. They said EF did not like Z to be messy or spill anything on him and if he did that could cause anxiety for EF. An example of this appears in the recording for the contact on 29 January when Z got upset having his nappy changed, causing EF to get anxious and flustered. EF took himself out of the room and on his return told Z he was spoiling contact. When Z was sick he told him to stop it, becoming yet more stressed. Eventually he ended the contact early, blaming Z for that. The worker recorded on putting Z in his car seat he was �physically shaking�. This really is worrying, showing how badly EF copes when stressed and how that could impact on a child. Equally I set that against a number of other notes of positive contact, albeit in the context of many contacts being missed by him due to other commitments and being stressed. EF in his evidence spoke of at times just needing to stay in his room when he was stressed, that that was better than going to contact, which really troubled me in terms of how that would work were the children in the household with the parents.  Overall the workers said Z appeared more relaxed in his mother's company than his father's, and that he could appear quite subdued when being held by his father, often looking away and giving no facial expression. They concluded �The overall stability of the contact sessions appears to depend on parent�s mood that day. Often, if EF arrives in a happy, upbeat mood, so is AB, which impacts on Z's mood and on contact�.. However, if EF arrives low in mood, AB also seems low and very quiet and this impacts on Z and how the contact goes - an example of this would be that Z will prefer to stay around AB when EF does not seem in a positive mood and EF is less able to deal with situations such as trying to change Z's clothes if he has been sick.� They also spoke at times of contact being cut short by parents because EF was getting upset at something Z was doing and not being able to get back from that. I have to say that statement from the family centre very much was borne out by the contact notes which I read. It was clear there could be some lovely contact but the concerns raised by the workers were evident in the notes. The level of missed contacts did surprise me. The mother accepted out of fifty two contacts offered to her with X and Y between mid November and mid March she had missed twenty. She had only missed four of Z�s. I acknowledge the pattern of contact she was faced with was demanding, effectively five mornings with Z and then three afternoons with the older children, and I do understand she had to fit other appointments in. The focus though on Z�s rather than X and Y�s I find surprising. EF acknowledged he had in particular missed a very significant number of X and Y�s contact sessions, thirty seven out of fifty two, attending more of Z�s. He said this was due to other commitments and also to times when he felt the children were ignoring him in contact which led him to question why he would go when it made him feel bad. That did trouble me, his focus on himself rather than the children. It also did not fit with the mother who was very clear the children did want to see him despite what they had told other people. She asked them about this, as she put it to me saying to them �why when you have told me you want to see him and you love him to bits�. I think this shows her focus on being a family unit with EF, meeting his needs ahead of those of her children.  The other witness from whom I heard in respect of the parents with very direct relevant evidence was Dr Naomi Murphy, a consultant clinical and forensic psychologist. She had been commissioned at the request of the guardian to carry out an assessment of the parents, looking at issues around risk. She prepared two separate detailed reports and gave oral evidence. Before I look at her evidence in detail I am going to look at the drug and alcohol hair test results as they are relevant to Dr Murphy's assessment. The test results cover the period October 2013 to January 2014. The alcohol hair test in respect of the mother was not suggestive of chronic excessive alcohol consumption. In respect of EF blood test results record �biochemical evidence of excessive alcohol ingestion�. However in the hair testing, ethyl glucuronide was detected in his chest hair but not fatty acid ethyl esters. The testing company then says that as the hair test was of a chest hair sample the results could not be compared with standard test results and therefore could not be used to determine whether he had consumed alcohol to a chronic excessive level, a singularly unhelpful result. I shall come back later to EF's evidence but he certainly accepted using alcohol over this period, particularly at a high level around Christmas which was a stressful time. Turning to the drug test results, in respect of AB they showed cannabis in each of the three periods tested, the level being described as high in each period. Amphetamines were also found in each period, the highest being the last which covered the beginning of December 2013 to the beginning of January 2014. Codeine too was found in each of the three periods, this coming from prescription medication which AB takes. EF�s drug test results showed use of amphetamines and cannabis, both at high levels. Metabolites of cocaine (low levels) were also found in his test results which it was said could be attributed to the use by him of having used cocaine or him having been exposed to it by others in the vicinity smoking it. I should also mention here that the results did not entirely corroborate what Dr Murphy was told, for example EF saying he had not used cocaine for seven months previously and suggesting amphetamine use was a past recreational pursuit. Likewise his estimate of his alcohol use did not mirror the results which were more like that described by AB.  Turning back then to the reports of Dr Murphy, I got a very real sense in her report of the difficulties the parents have faced in their own childhoods. I am not going to go into great details here but EF experienced extreme violence from his father caused to him, his mother and brother. After his parents separated he was pushed from pillar to post and spent most of his time living with an uncle who was an alcoholic although clearly a very significant person in his life. He was taken into care when he was nine and had bad experiences, including being in an approved school. As a child he was convicted of arson and received a significant sentence. He has a history of drug use going back to his childhood and was honest about this, acknowledging that of all substances he has a weakness for alcohol. He has an extensive criminal history although not it is accepted in the last three years. He was violent to his ex-wife who obtained an injunction against him which he broke. He has a diagnosis of personality disorder dating back to twelve years ago when he was in prison. He has sought assistance from his doctor in reducing his use of alcohol on four reported occasions and also raised concerns upon occasion about his aggression and use of illegal drugs. Dr Murphy noted that though his GP had referred him to a specialist support he did not attend an appointment offered by a drug and alcohol team in 2008. Of the impact of his childhood on him Dr Murphy said: �EF�s childhood history of trauma and neglect has had a profound impact upon his personality development and thus impacts upon his interpersonal relationships, his ability to regulate his emotions, his cognitions and his level of impulsivity (as dealt with under personality disorder). EF�s strategy for managing his history of trauma is to avoid reflecting upon it and to avoid any reminders and this can require considerable effort to control his life in order to keep intrusive thoughts out. Paradoxically, his failure to resolve his history of abuse and neglect makes him hypersensitive to these themes and he presents as hyper-vigilant and therefore more likely to arise at erroneous conclusions that he is at risk of harm or abandonment than someone who has not been traumatised. This demand for emotional energy places the psyche under considerable strain leaving little space for coping with other stressors in life.�  Dr Murphy agreed with the previous diagnosis of EF, saying he would meet DSM-V diagnostic criteria for personality disorder, in particular anti-social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. She acknowledged an improvement in his presentation in terms of antisocial behaviour but said the improvement had occurred as a consequence of being in a relationship in which he is relatively happy with the threat of losing his child hanging over him. Dr Murphy described how EF had a history of intense relationships where he fluctuates from feeling very strong positive emotions to very strong negative emotions. She noted he has a history of impulsive behaviour. She said: �EF finds it difficult to acknowledge or articulate his emotions and has a tendency to try and avoid them through use of substances or anti-social behaviours including violence and other impulsive behaviours. When he is unable to avoid strong negative affect which makes him feel vulnerable, he becomes overwhelmed and has few resources to cope thus he experiences emotions at their extremes, for instance, feeling hopeless rather than sad or enraged rather than angry. Consequently, those around him will be subjected to extreme mood states which may fluctuate rapidly and be difficult to predict and lead to inconsistency in parenting style. Because EF cannot cope adequately with his own emotional state using internal resources, others will have to cope with his use of external �resources� which may mean exposure to inebriation or aggression or violence.� Dr Murphy accepted that from what she had seen the relationship between the couple was in many ways positive. She saw EF as dominant but did not gain the impression that was because he intimidated AB. She described the relationship not as one of balanced equals but one in which there is one dominant competent partner who needs to be needed and to whom it is functional to look after others and where there is a second partner who is more passive and enjoys an absence of responsibility. That accords with my impression of the couple as I saw physical affection and reassurance during the hearing. Dr Murphy was asked whether the lack of reported incidents of domestic violence represented change. She said she could not be confident that AB would report incidents but she accepted it was possible the relationship had not yet included domestic violence. However she said this did not guarantee a change that will be maintained and was in fact more likely to suggest that EF was currently feeling relatively contained. She said personality is relatively stable and unlikely to change. EF's domestic violence is driven by his personality functioning suggesting that unless his personality disorder is addressed he will remain at risk of using violence in the future. In terms of how his personality type would affect his parenting, Dr Murphy said �EF appears quite fragile and I would hypothesise that he is himself hypersensitive to criticism since it evokes strong feelings of shame which he would be unable to cope with and would also trigger fear of abandonment. EF�s difficulties in talking about his emotions would make it difficult for him to express anxiety that he is about to be left or betrayed and so contribute to acting out his emotions behaviourally rather than simply stating that he feels insecure. Within relationships with children, this may mean that feelings of inadequacy are triggered by disobedience or perceived disobedience/disrespect and this would be exacerbated as a child becomes more autonomous and more capable of dissenting.� Again this chimed with comments I have read in the contact notes in respect of Z. Dr Murphy said it is really important for a child's development that their caregiver can respond in an attuned way to displays of distress but EF's inability to tolerate negative emotion would suggest that he would find this task difficult if not impossible. She said her own experience of him was when he is anxious he seems hostile, intimidating or frightening and this seems to be a common experience of EF. She said she thought it inevitable there would be occasions within the home where he would be experienced as frightening by children as long as he avoids addressing his difficulties in coping with his emotions. Dr Murphy was of the opinion that EF required long-term psychological treatment which would take at least twelve months. She recommended particular types of treatment which may be most suitable. She was clear there needed to be a period of abstinence from alcohol and drugs, particularly as she pointed out the psychological treatment would be likely to destabilise EF in the short term. She acknowledged the difficulties there would be for EF in facing up to this work. She said �If EF is to engage in treatment in a meaningful way he will need to be able to muster up enough curiosity about himself and the courage to tolerate experiencing emotions he has long avoided and risk being harmed or rejected.� She acknowledged he had sought out a referral for treatment during the course of her assessment. She said if he could start the work a review at four months would enable a more accurate understanding of whether he could use such opportunity to address his childhood trauma. In her oral evidence she expanded on this to say that the four-month period would need to be counted from when he had ceased to use alcohol and illicit drugs due to those masking the feelings he needed to confront. She said would it be inappropriate for Z to be in his care until after that review period to make sure he had engaged in a meaningful way but importantly that he had not destabilised to a degree that would increase his risk.  Turning to the assessment of AB, again Dr Murphy went through the problems she had faced as a young person and how she began using cannabis at the age of fourteen, drinking alcohol at fifteen, using amphetamines slightly later. Dr Murphy was clear that AB too had to face up to difficulties from her childhood including problems in her relationships with both her parents. She said �AB�s childhood history of trauma and neglect has had a profound impact upon her personality development and thus impacts upon her interpersonal relationships, her ability to regulate her emotions and her cognitions (dealt with later in this section). AB�s strategy for managing her history of trauma and neglect is to avoid reflecting upon it and to avoid any reminders and this can require considerable effort to control her life in order to keep intrusive thoughts out. Moreover, her inability to integrate and accept awareness of her parents deficits makes it difficult to be aware of her own vulnerabilities and acknowledge her own deficits in parenting.� She said AB �generally avoids experiencing emotions which make her feel vulnerable and chooses not to reflect upon information that would make her connect with such affect, relying upon substances as a pathological means of maintaining this strategy by facilitating avoidance of thought/reflection and feeling. Impairment in her capacity to cope with emotion would inevitably impact upon her ability to respond to her children�s emotions especially those which cause internal conflict such as those which arise in relation to her own actions or challenge her romantic relationships�. In terms of her relationships, Dr Murphy noted she had tolerated a relationship with CD which was characterised by extreme violence. As I said, Dr Murphy acknowledged there may not yet be violence within the relationship of the parents. However she said �I think there is still a high risk that AB will maintain a relationship with a man who is aggressive or violent for a number of reasons: she minimised the extent of EF�s violence towards a former partner and does not appear to have been curious about his violence towards other women or his children; AB was aware that the relationship with CD was likely to be damaging to children when she was in the relationship and yet chose to maintain it, she finds it difficult to discuss the effects of violence on children, her current relationship seems predicated upon the belief that she is to some degree defective or inadequate and needs a partner to support her and she has not engaged in any work which will address the underlying, personality driven motivation to persist with an unhealthy relationship.� She said AB showed signs of having a dependent personality and she feared that her need to maintain a relationship would override all other considerations.  Looking at how this might impact on the children Dr Murphy concluded �Even if EF is not violent as AB and EF both assert, my own brief contact with EF indicates that he has the potential to be experienced by others as aggressive and intimidating. Living within an environment where one parental figure presents in such a manner is likely to expose the children to very strong negative affect such as fear, sadness, anger, loneliness and shame which is unlikely to be matched with an attuned response and thus cause emotional difficulties. AB�s inability to stand up and protect either herself or the children is likely to cause the children to be angry with AB and role model conflictual, tense relationships as to some degree normal.� Dr Murphy acknowledged that AB had undertaken work with a domestic violence worker and that she believed she would now take action if she was assaulted, but Dr Murphy felt this highly unlikely. She said the theme of abandonment has a major significance for AB, leaving her unable to end a relationship of her own volition no matter how bad that relationship was, and that would include her relationship with EF. Dr Murphy also expressed her concern about AB's inability to cope without misusing medication and illegal drugs, looking at the history of AB's cannabis use in particular.  Turning to psychological treatment, Dr Murphy was of the view that AB did require this over the medium to long term to deal with the impact her father's abandonment had on her and her behaviour in relationships and that this would be likely to take six to nine months. Again the issue of her needing to abstain from cannabis use was relevant as Dr Murphy said otherwise it would be difficult for any therapist to facilitate increased tolerance of emotion in her. I have set out Dr Murphy's views in quite some detail here because the local authority and guardian rely on them but also because for me they seemed very germane to the core of this case. Her evidence gave me a much clearer understanding of the problems the parents face, let me be clear not of their own making, and the work they will need to undergo to make themselves emotionally well again. Looking at the evidence of the parents, AB and EF were clear that they do not accept the children have suffered harm in their care or that the children would be at risk of suffering harm were they returned to their care. They point out that the local authority had stepped down its involvement with the family on 16 September 2013. They do not accept that any of the events thereafter should have led it to issue proceedings. The parents understandably sought to rely on the very positive assessment of Larry Anderson in July/August 2013, Mr Anderson having seen them together with the children when Dr Murphy did not. I have read that statement and, as the social worker and guardian acknowledged, it is clearly very positive in terms of the care he saw the parents give the children and of the attachments he witnessed. Mr Anderson also was clear that the parents had been able to take on board suggestions he had made and work with him. Ms Mellor said in her submissions no one had sought to say how his conclusions were different to the current position. I remind myself though this was done at a time when EF was in work and was not particularly depressed. EF spoke in his evidence of his depression being recurrent and I note he did not seek any medical attention, that not being his way of dealing with things. It seems to me perfectly possible that this is why Mr Anderson saw a different picture to that which began to re-emerge after the step down in September.  Looking at matters which led the local authority to begin proceedings, EF acknowledged that at hospital on 5 October he was particularly worried about the terrible situation Z seemed to be in. He said he was panicking and accepted there were lots of arm gestures and raised voices. He said the emergency in hospital staff all misinterpreted this as it was in no way meant to be aggressive. I have to say though what is clear from the recording of these incidents is emergency and hospital staff were very clear that what they saw was worrying, however EF meant it to seem. Again, his behaviour was seen as different to that exhibited by other anxious parents which, as Ms Cliffe identified, would not normally lead to a referral to EDT.  Then on 22 October, when the local authority went to discuss the referral the NSPCC had received with the couple, EF said he felt was being unfairly accused. He accepted because he felt threatened he became agitated with the social workers, particularly Ms Cliffe. He acknowledges there were raised voices in the presence of the children which he regretted. However overall he denied being aggressive in the presence of the children and denied the children had any reason to be scared of him.  Turning to Y's bruising, AB did not accept there should be concerns about this which she had explained to the local authority as being caused by the children play fighting and Y falling off the bed. EF agreed with this explanation. He said on many occasions the couple had told the children for jumping off their beds or even the windowsill. He acknowledged X by being older might use too much force on Y when play fighting. He was clear neither he nor AB had grabbed Y�s face to cause any of the bruising. AB acknowledged difficulties in her relationship with social workers, she said as result of the allegations made which led to the proceedings being started. She felt right at the beginning of the care proceedings the local authority had been clear that the children would be removed and they had made up their minds. She accepted in the respect of the heated discussions with the local authority on 24 October that the children would have heard what was going on when social services and police came to the house and this would have upset them. Despite all this AB and EF said they would work with the local authority if they need to following this final hearing. Looking at AB�s relationship history, she accepted there was violence in her relationship with CD but denied there was in her relationship with EF. She says she had involvement with a domestic violence worker and from what she had learned would not remain in such relationship again. She says she and EF argued but no more than that. She could see EF would be perceived as the louder of the two of them but she did not feel dominated. EF�s evidence very much echoed that. In terms of her alcohol use, she said in her statement of 6 December 2013 this was not a particular problem. She said prior to proceedings she would only really drink on a night out but rarely at home. She accepted she had smoked cannabis for a number of years but denied smoking in front of the children. She said prior to that statement they would have smoked as a couple �40-�50 W of cannabis per week. She accepted she had used amphetamines if she went for a night out at the weekend maybe once or twice a month. She denied having used any since early November. From her oral evidence I found it very hard to get a precise picture about what she was saying of her current consumption but it seemed to be the cost had reduced to �30-�40 per week, with her using about half. She, and indeed EF, said they had been advised by their workers not to stop immediately as it could make them extremely paranoid but instead to reduce gradually. The goal for both of them was to stop eventually.  AB was clear she had taken on board the recommendations of Dr Murphy. In respect of her drug and alcohol use she had said in her December statement that she had engaged with The substance misuse project and she repeated this in her final statement. I was shown a note confirming she went to her initial assessment session in fact only on 20 February 2014, an earlier session having had to be cancelled, and she had attended one session since. Two other sessions had been cancelled by the project. She said it was extremely difficult to organise sessions around all her contact sessions but she said she would keep going. She had also taken steps to see a therapist who she is funding privately due to the length of the NHS waiting list. She said she had had four sessions with him which she felt had been beneficial. In her final statement AB said she and EF were seeing Relate in relation to their relationship. This in fact turned out not to be accurate. They had contacted the organisation and arranged an appointment which did not happen. They do not have another session booked because they cannot afford the cost of this but say they would be happy to go. EF too has filed several statements in these proceedings. He does not seek to avoid the problems he has from his past and his poor criminal record. He admits domestic violence in his relationship with his ex-wife which led to him losing contact with his older children. Following a conviction in 2010 for assault on her he said he attended an IDAP course as part of his probation requirement. He felt this had helped him to learn about the harmful effects of domestic abuse and how he could cope better with his behaviour and feelings in stressful situations. He was clear his relationship with AB was completely different, as he described it in his statement �a close, loving and mutually supportive relationship�. He did accept though that the couple argued, �clashed� as he described it, although he said not in front of the children whilst they may have heard it. He said it happened because he was depressed, out of work, running out of money, worried about the decorating the house needed, and things like that. Also the authorities were coming to the house which was stressful.  In terms of his drug and alcohol use, in November 2013 EF said he was a social drinker and would drink a few cans of ordinary strength lager with friends and family at home in the evenings. At the weekend he would share lager with friends and could drink at ten to twelve cans of lager each throughout the day. Alternatively when he was working he would go to the pub with friends drinking up to six pints of lager. He acknowledged in the past alcohol issues had been a serious problem for him but not now, although it seemed to me his alcohol use had gone up now he is not working. In terms of his drug use, in November last year he said he was a regular cannabis user and agreed with the estimate of �50 per week being spent between the couple. He explained cannabis had calmed down his mood over the years, meaning he was not as on edge and was much better now with people around him. He thought it helped him with trusting people although this was the opposite of the effect Dr Murphy said it would have. He said he took amphetamines occasionally when out socially with friends and had last used on 8 November. Cocaine he said he had not used for more than three or four months. I was certainly left with the very clear impression that drugs for EF were something he would turn to when stressed despite what Dr Murphy had said about the negative impact of them and alcohol.  EF like AB said he had taken on board what Dr Murphy had said and was trying to address those issues. He could see that people may experience him as being anxious and having a slight �edge� which could come over as being aggressive or hostile. I do note though the evidence of the social worker, medical and emergency staff who have seen something considerably more aggressive, however it was intended. EF was clear he was turning his life around, having abstained from criminal activity for almost three years and having avoided domestic violence in his relationship with AB.  EF said he had self-referred to the substance misuse project regarding cannabis and alcohol use. In terms of his engagement with them I saw a letter from the project which confirmed he had attended three out of eight possible appointments, reporting he had not been to the others due to different commitments and appointments with other agencies. In his evidence he admitted one session he failed to attend, rebooked, and then did not go to the new date as he was stressed. He acknowledged he had yet to begin therapy, having not been able to identify anyone with the requisite skills, although he had referred himself to the B Project who would address issues relating to anger management. Despite that EF did not accept the children could not come home until he was well into his therapy as recommended by Dr Murphy.  I do not want to overlook CD in this judgment although he did not give evidence before me and the issues that I am addressing in this judgment largely do not affect him. He came back into the lives of his children in a meaningful way as a result of these proceedings being issued, contact as I have said having broken down for reasons on which he and AB do not agree but I was not asked to go into. Within these proceedings he did offer to care for the children and was assessed along with his current partner. The assessment was negative and he has not sought to challenge but it is very clear he wants to continue to be part of the lives of his children. I heard from his counsel that he would be content to work with the level of contact the local authority proposes, namely six times a year in school holidays, and to see how things work out over time with the children in the care of his sister.  Threshold  In the light of the evidence I have read and heard, I am going to look first at threshold as this is not agreed. I accept that the relevant date here is the commencement of the proceedings but I do not accept that I am precluded from looking back to the period before that, even though the local authority stepped down its involvement in September. Harm is often cumulative and one has to look back across a child�s life to see how it has been affected.  I have been helpfully referred by advocates to a number of cases as to the nature of what amounts to significant harm. A commonly quoted paragraph is that of Ward LJ in Re M A (Children) [2009] EWCA Civ 853 where he said: �given the underlying philosophy of the act, the harm must, in my judgment, be significant enough to justify the intervention of the state and disturb the autonomy of the parents to bring up their children by themselves in the way they choose. It must be significant enough to enable the Court to make a Care Order or a Supervision Order if the welfare of the child demands it�. That I have in mind as I approach the findings sought by the local authority. I am very conscious that any or all of the findings could be facts that are established but do not amount to a threshold finding.  The first finding sought by the local authority is that AB, EF and CD have each previously been involved in relationships that were volatile and aggressive and the children have on occasion been witness to volatile disputes either between or involving their parents. The very nature of these relationships has caused the children to suffer emotional harm in the past and exposes them to the continued risk of emotional harm in the future.  Both AB and CD accept there was violence in their relationship. From the evidence I have read it is clear the children�s behaviour was affected prior to AB and EF forming their relationship. It is widely accepted now that witnessing domestic abuse impacts on children�s emotional well-being, quite apart from putting them at risk of physical harm, and I am satisfied therefore they suffered significant harm whilst in the care of AB and CD.  Regarding AB and EF�s relationship, I accept there is no evidence of physical violence in their relationship. From what I have seen of them and read, there are clearly positives in their relationship and I accept that they feel they gain many benefits from it. Having said this, I am satisfied that they are the people described in Dr Murphy�s report. EF remains a man with significant issues and a predisposition to anger. He is loud and when under stress is unable to regulate his behaviour. This has clearly happened in the presence of professionals, namely Ms Cliffe and medical staff, and I have no reason to doubt that at times this surfaces in the family home. I note X�s reports to school of his mother and step-father shouting at each other, borne out by the anonymous report to the NSPCC (upon which I would not place reliance if it were unsupported in any other way). I note how X has presented in school, not just on 25 October. On that date I accept he had witnessed serious arguments the night before involving AB, EF and professionals and that that was a particularly stressful situation for the family. However it seems to be extremely likely that the argument continued before school, the parents still being stressed, causing more upset to X. The way he presented in school, Y�s lack of concern at the arguments when she was present, both say to me that these children have been affected by volatility and aggression in their home, not just when AB and EF were together. I note that X has asked that EF should not come to contact. I have considered if this was borne out of loyalty to his birth father after he had been reintroduced to the children. The first reference I found was on 16 December which was before the children had any direct contact with their father although X had spoken to him on the phone. Whilst I acknowledge it is possible that was a factor in X�s request, I put X�s comments alongside those he made to his school teacher. I am satisfied that in the home, as Mr George put it in his submissions, the children were exposed to shouting, arguments, aggressive and conflicted behaviour which caused emotional harm. I therefore make the first finding as sought by the local authority. The local authority then turns to Y�s bruising. I am clear that I am not being invited to make a finding that any of Y�s injuries were non-accidental. The local authority however is concerned at the extent of her bruising, the particular nature of one of the injuries which were consistent with injury having been caused according to Dr Ward, the treating paediatrician, the fact that Y had been off nursery for about a week before they were seen, and the fact that the parents denied having seen virtually any of the injuries to her torso.  I have looked carefully at Dr Ward�s report and at the statement from Y�s nursery worker. I found AB�s evidence regarding what she had seen of the bruises very unconvincing. It is inconceivable that she would have left her daughter to bath and dress herself such that she did not see them. I think she knew they would attract the attention of professionals and deliberately kept Y off nursery, having been reluctant to let the social workers see Y either. I cannot know with any confidence how they were caused but I acknowledge the volume of bruising is troubling. The mother in her evidence accepted maybe the children had not been supervised as well as they might. EF in his statement said that the children had been allowed to play upstairs unsupervised despite having been known to jump off beds and windowsills. I do not think that it was only ten minutes the children were left for. I remind myself these are parents who misuse drugs and, in EF�s case, alcohol and I doubt they are always as available to the children as they should be.  I am satisfied therefore that Y�s bruises were the result at least of a lack of supervision. The question therefore is whether this is significant harm. Ms Mellor and Mr Howcroft both remind me of the breadth of parenting that must be tolerated as described in Re L [2006] EWCA Civ 1282. I accept that parents cannot supervise children all the time and that to require this would be a counsel of perfection. However the fact that the parents knew not just that the children fought in play but that they jumped off beds and window sills should have caused them to offer better supervision than they did. I think AB knew that when she kept Y off nursery. I am therefore going to make this finding but would reword it thus: Whilst in the care of AB and EF, Y suffered bruising to her face, neck, chin, torso and groin. The injuries sustained by Y are the result of a lack of appropriate supervision of the children, by either or both of AB and EF.  The next finding sought relates to EF�s drug and alcohol use. The local authority invites me to find as follows : EF has a significant history of drug and alcohol misuse which appears to fluctuate and for which he has engaged in only limited formal intervention to support abstinence. His use of alcohol was a significant feature in incidents of domestic abuse in his previous relationships and he admits to ongoing substance use in the form of regular alcohol and cannabis consumption. EF�s substance use whilst having the primary care of the children has the potential to impair his parenting capacity and thus exposes them to the risk of significant physical and emotional harm and the overall neglect of their basic care needs. On the evidence before me this finding is made out. The test results themselves are of significant concern but I put alongside these the history given to Dr Murphy, EF�s own concessions and AB�s evidence. Alcohol is a disinhibiting factor and EF knows his own history of problems caused by this. I had no sense this family had a social world that did not involve the consumption of alcohol and, linked to that, the consumption of drugs, it having been explained that the reason to take amphetamines is so one can continue to drink without the full effect. I agree that consumption of alcohol, amphetamines and cannabis would have impaired parenting ability and exposed the children to risk of harm. A similar finding is sought regarding AB, namely that AB has a significant history of drug use which has included the use of both illicit substances and prescription medication. She admits to ongoing substance use in the form of regular alcohol and cannabis consumption. AB�s substance use whilst having the primary care of the children has the potential to impair her parenting capacity and thus exposes them to the risk of significant physical and emotional harm and the overall neglect of their basic care needs. Again, for the same reasons as I have given regarding EF I would make these findings, save that I would not mention alcohol in relation to AB. Her alcohol tests did not show a chronic consumption of alcohol and I am conscious this included the Christmas period which I know the parents found particularly difficult. Whilst she clearly drinks socially at times I do not think alcohol is her �medication of choice�. Next the local authority turns to the children�s basic care needs, seeking a finding that AB has failed to ensure the basic care needs of X and Y have been met in that she has failed to ensure their regular and timely attendance at school and nursery, thus impairing their educational and social development.  As I have said, the parents have clearly given the children good parenting over periods of time, evidenced by the local authority stepping down its involvement in September 2013. The social worker agreed this was a case where the issue was not capability but consistency over time. Looking at the children�s school attendance, I turn to the evidence of IJ and KL. It is clear that the children did not attend nursery and school consistently after the Child Protection Review in mid September. IJ was so clear as to the fact that the change happened at that point, when the parents I am sure felt they had proved themselves and could relax. In the past it seems attendance had been better, particularly evident from KL who was surprised at Y suddenly missing nursery in October prior to the bruises being seen. I do not think all these absences can be explained by illness and I find stemmed from the parents taking their eyes off the ball. It was clearly a time of stress in the household, with EF having lost his job and being around most of the time. He was depressed and drinking more which I am sure impacted on him getting up, and both parents were using cannabis which Dr Murphy said affected motivation. I am satisfied the children were missing school and nursery and this would over time have impacted on their educational and social development.  Again though, as with the bruising, does this amount to significant harm? If it had continued at the level it did I accept over time harm would have been caused. Children need to be at school consistently to benefit from education, to socialise with their peers and make friends, to get a sense of the importance of structure, and they are harmed if this is denied them. The family lived opposite the school but could not consistently get them to school on time. They had to be contacted by the school to find out where the children were. I suspect this all linked back to the problems in the household at that time, a situation I have every expectation would have continued albeit not every day or every week.  The final finding sought by the local authority within its draft threshold is that AB and EF have failed to co-operate with professionals in their enquiries and investigations consistently and have on occasions displayed a hostile and threatening attitude towards social workers and health professionals. Their behaviour and attitude raises concerns about their ability to work with Children�s Services and other professionals in the future openly, honestly and with commitment. From the evidence I am satisfied that this is factually true in relation to Children�s Services, given the social worker�s evidence about the difficulties in engaging the parents, the evidence of health professionals about their experiences with him, and even Dr Murphy who accepted she herself (as a woman experienced in working with violent individuals) did not feel threatened but could see how other professionals would experience EF. I am not sure it is true regarding other professionals given the engagement with the IFS Team and Larry Anderson. I also find it very hard to imagine the couple working with the local authority in a constructive way in the future, in part because until therapy is successful they, particularly EF, remain the people they are but also because of the significant effect the act of bringing these proceedings has had on matters.  What I am less sure about is whether this paragraph should properly be in a threshold document, whether as a direct result of this the children had suffered or were likely to suffer significant harm. I think the arguments witnessed affected the children but I have covered that in my first finding. I can see how lack of co-operation could have an impact but I am not sure in itself it would be significant. I would not therefore include this factual finding in my threshold document following on from this hearing.  Looking at threshold generally, Ms Mellor on behalf of AB submitted that overall the likelihood of harm was low. I do not agree with this. I think the risks inherent in the relationship between AB and EF are significant. I think harm has been caused and is likely to be caused in the future and the level of that emotional harm cannot be minimised. Domestic abuse takes many forms and is not confined to physical violence. To reduce the harm being done in the family requires therapy which in itself brings risks. I am entirely satisfied that the harm caused to the children and likely to be caused to them as a result of AB and EF�s alcohol and drug misuse and the aggression and volatility in their relationship is significant and meets the threshold for statutory involvement.   Decision  I now turn to consider what orders if any are in the best interests of X, Y and Z. I start very clearly from the position that, wherever possible, children should be brought up by their natural parents and if not by other members of their family. The state should not interfere in family life so as to separate children from their families unless it has been demonstrated to be both necessary and proportionate and that no other less radical form of order would achieve the essential aim of promoting their welfare. In Re B [2013] UKSC 33 the Supreme Court emphasised this, reminding us such orders are �very extreme�, and should only be made when �necessary� for the protection of the child�s interests, �when nothing else will do�. The court �must never lose sight of the fact that (the child�s) interests include being brought up by her natural family, ideally her parents, or at least one of them� and adoption �should only be contemplated as a last resort�. I have looked again at the words of the President in Re B-S (Children) [2013] ECA Civ 1146 as well as the judgments in Re B (supra) and reminded myself of the importance of addressing my mind to all the options for these children, taking into account the assistance and support which the authorities or others should offer. In reaching my decision I have taken into account that the children�s welfare is my paramount consideration and also the need to make the least interventionist order possible. I have to consider the Article 8 rights of the adults and the children as any decision I make today will inevitably involve an interference with the right to respect to family life. Having given very careful consideration to the orders I am going on to make, I am satisfied that those orders are in accordance with law, necessary for the protection of the children�s rights and are proportionate. I am conscious that I must have in mind the general principle that any delay in determining the question is likely to prejudice the welfare of the child, particularly Z in this case.  I have to ask myself two central questions in this case, one in respect of X and Y and a different one for Z. For the older children the question for me is whether they should be rehabilitated to the care of their mother and stepfather, with or without statutory orders, or whether they should be placed with GH and HH. If the latter, no one disagrees that this should be under a special guardianship order. There is also the ancillary question of the level of contact they should have with their father and with their mother, and whether EF should play any part in that at this time. In respect of Z the options are more stark and the question more serious. I have to consider for him too if he can return to the care of his mother and father. If not the question is whether he should have the opportunity of being adopted, there being no other family option for him, no one suggesting at his age he should be placed in long-term foster care. My task is to balance the pros and cons of each of the options being presented to me. McFarlane LJ in Re G [2013] EWCA Civ 965 said �What is required is a balancing exercise in which each option is evaluated to the degree of detail necessary to analyse and weigh its own internal positives and negatives and each option is then compared, side by side, against the competing option or options.� In addressing this task I have considered all the points in the welfare checklist, in Z�s case the two checklists contained in both the Children Act 1989 and the Adoption and Children Act 2002.  A significant factor in relation to all three children is any harm which they have suffered or are at risk of suffering. I am satisfied that the children have suffered harm in the care of AB and EF and would be at risk of harm were they to be returned to their care. I am conscious that the parents without a doubt want that to be different but I am afraid we are a long way from the point when it might be otherwise. Given the evidence of Dr Murphy the reasons for the parents� personalities are very clear and neither of them can be blamed for this. They are the product of their upbringings, EF in particular, and my heart went out to him as he said he would go anywhere, do anything, to be different. No one should have the experiences they had as children but I accept Dr Murphy�s evidence that until they fully engage in therapy, without the crutch of alcohol or illicit drugs, they are not going to be in a position to care safely for a child. The aggression, the arguments, will continue, fuelled by drugs and alcohol, and the children will witness this. X and Y experienced it between their parents and teaching them that the same can happen in another relationship cannot be healthy. They are now growing up with a very different experience of family, where people do not argue aggressively and where their needs are met. Were they to be returned to the care of AB and EF that would change. And the same is true of Z in his foster placement. He has not experienced as much of the aggression as his siblings but he has been in the house when volatile arguments have happened and the future risk of harm would be the same for him as for his older brother and sister. I am satisfied that AB and EF are not able to meet the children�s needs at this time, much as I am sure they want to. EF made a heartfelt plea in his evidence when he said �I have a right to be a dad�. I agree with that but first he and AB have to be able to meet a child�s needs and I am afraid neither of them are able to do so now, much as I hope they will be one day once they have successfully become abstinent and completed what I am sure will be painful therapy.  I have considered whether there are resources the local authority could put in to assist the parents to meet the children�s needs, as was done last summer under the Child Protection Plan. I think we know a lot more now though than the local authority did then about the challenges this family face, the level of damage done to the parents, the significance of the drug and alcohol misuse, the aggression in the home. I acknowledge the local authority could fund all the necessary therapy but that in itself would not ensure a successful outcome. The parents have oversold in their evidence the extent to which they have already started tackling their problems. EF in particular has barely engaged with The substance misuse project and from his oral evidence I am unsure he really sees the value in the service. AB has done more but she too is a long way from being drug free, having on her own evidence cut down from cannabis use most nights of the week to using it five or maybe six nights. And Dr Murphy�s evidence was that even if the therapy were successfully underway and abstinence been achieved, the children could not go back whilst there was the potential for therapy destabilising the couple. I agree with the professionals therefore that there is no level of support which could be put in which could enable any of the children to go home now or in the near future.  I have considered whether I should adjourn these proceedings on interim orders to see what progress the parents make. However I have to think about timescales for Z in particular. He is already one and the clock is ticking for him if he is to find an adoptive placement. For me to wait therefore I would have to know that would not be for too long and that the likelihood of him going home was good. I am afraid I think we are too far off therapy being successful for that to be the case. Both parents need to become abstinent for the therapy to be meaningful and for progress to be made, although I do see that the simple act of being in a strong therapeutic relationship may in itself make abstinence possible. AB is in the early stages of establishing that relationship, EF has not begun the process. Similarly AB has begun engagement with The substance misuse project, EF very much less so, but the steps they have taken to abstinence so far are extremely limited. Given that there could not be a review on Dr Murphy�s evidence for three or four months from abstinence as opposed merely to calculating from the beginning of therapy, I am afraid this is simply outside Z�s timescales.  GH and HH I am satisfied are able to meet the needs of X and Y. From the assessment I have read of them and indeed from their own informal statement provided to the court, they are clearly child focused and have made a significant change to their lives to care for their niece and nephew.  I cannot ignore the harm that the children will suffer if they do not go back home though. X and Y are lucky in that they are in a placement where they can still have a relationship with each other and with their parents. Z, if he is adopted, will lose all of that. I have to consider the relationship which he has with his parents, his siblings, looking at the likelihood of any such relationship continuing and the value to him of it doing so.  I do not doubt for one minute that when the children lived together they were a clear unit and that there would be a benefit to Z if that could continue. There is no placement however where they can be together and I have to then balance that relationship against the chance of an adoptive placement for Z. The guardian told me the local authority had given thought to the possibility of looking for adopters for him who would support sibling contact but that may come to nothing given the link back to the birth family. She acknowledged the loss for Z of his birth family, particularly his siblings, but she was clear in her analysis that she had to balance that against the need for him to have a secure and stable placement. I think it is regrettable that the children have had so little shared contact since they have been in care but sadly even if they had I think it would be very hard to prioritise that relationship now. I would ask the local authority to look for adopters open to the possibility of such contact, or as a minimum to good quality indirect contact, but I agree with the guardian that has to come second to finding him the right placement.  In reaching the decision I have over this hearing, I acknowledge it is not what AB and EF want. I do not doubt their genuine desire to be the best parents they can be to their son and to X and Y. However they cannot give the children the secure environment they need in which to develop. My task then is to find the next best option for them, to avoid any of them going through the grim childhoods AB and EF had and the vicious circle continuing.  The other factors in the checklists I am satisfied are of less significance than those I have dealt with above. The children are not of an age where their wishes and feelings are significant. Y and X have a more established relationship with their mother than Z and I am sure want to go on seeing her. I think their wishes in respect of EF need to be respected, hard though that will be for AB. The children are voicing that they do not want to see their mother and him arguing and at this point in time him staying away from contact is the best way that can be achieved. They also want to see their father, a person who is of significance to them and with whom they need to maintain a relationship. Whilst I cannot be sure why contact broke down whilst in their mother�s care, I am very confident that were X and Y to live with the Hs the children would be able to keep up a meaningful relationship with their father and his partner.  In terms of their needs, the children�s needs are the same as those of any other small child, for secure and stable homes, the best relationships they can with their family members, for warmth and love, for regular school attendance, and all the opportunities that being in a well-functioning family can bring. Sadly for Z the only way that can be offered to him is by way of adoption, given the lack of any possible family placement. I acknowledge that for him that means a change in his circumstances, unlike his siblings, but I am confident the local authority will manage that in the best possible way. Ms Cliffe has already shown her creativity in the way she tried to work with the family last year and I am confident she will apply the same skills to moving Z on in due course.  For X and Y then, balancing the options I have of return to their mother and EF�s care and staying where they are, I am satisfied for the reasons I have set out I should make special guardianship orders to GH and HH. No one invites me to make defined contact orders due to the need for this to be flexible over the children�s lives and I agree with that. I am sure over time the role the parents play in their lives will change, maybe EF will come to figure, and I am happy the responsibility for this can be left with their carers. I agree it would be sensible for a supervision order to be made, not because I have doubts about the carers but because I think all the family will benefit from some formal ongoing social work involvement after this very difficult time, particularly in respect to contact. I therefore endorse the local authority�s plans, described as �care plans� although there is not to be a care order, in respect of X and Y.  Turning then to Z, having carried out the balancing exercise that I must, I am satisfied that there is no realistic prospect of him being returned safely to his parents� care, and that his needs for stability and permanence can only be met in an adoptive placement. I am satisfied that the local authority�s final care plan for Z is proportionate and (in the context of both s1(1) Children Act 1989 and s1(2) Adoption and Children Act 2002) in his best welfare interests. I therefore make a care order. I am also satisfied that Z�s welfare requires me to dispense with his parents� consent to placing him for adoption, the word �require� here having the Strasbourg meaning of necessary, �the connotation of the imperative�. I therefore make a placement order authorising the local authority to place Z for adoption.  There is one further direction I wish to make. I think it is hugely important for children who are not in the care of their parents and particularly where they are adopted that they have information available to them, through their carers, so they can make sense of their early life. This judgment, in setting out what I have read and heard in court, gives at least a summary of that start. It is important that it is easily available to those who will be bringing Z up in particular. I propose therefore to make a direction that this judgment should be released by the Local Authority to GH and HH and to Z�s adopters so that it is available to them in future life.  Finally I also make an order for public funding assessment for all the respondents in this matter. I hope that my reasons as given are sufficient but if the advocates require any further detail to be given I would ask them to let me know.       FINDINGS OF FACT MADE    AB, EF and CD have each previously been involved in relationships that were volatile and aggressive and the children have on occasion been witness to volatile disputes either between or involving their parents. The very nature of these relationships has caused the children to suffer emotional harm in the past and exposes them to the continued risk of emotional harm in the future. Whilst in the care of AB and EF, Y suffered bruising to her face, neck, chin, torso and groin. The injuries sustained by Y are the result of a lack of appropriate supervision of the children, by either or both of AB and EF.  EF has a significant history of drug and alcohol misuse which appears to fluctuate and for which he has engaged in only limited formal intervention to support abstinence. His use of alcohol was a significant feature in incidents of domestic abuse in his previous relationships and he admits to ongoing substance use in the form of regular alcohol and cannabis consumption. EF�s substance use whilst having the primary care of the children has the potential to impair his parenting capacity and thus exposes them to the risk of significant physical and emotional harm and the overall neglect of their basic care needs. AB has a significant history of drug use which has included the use of both illicit substances and prescription medication. She admits to ongoing substance use in the form of regular alcohol and cannabis consumption. AB�s substance use whilst having the primary care of the children has the potential to impair her parenting capacity and thus exposes them to the risk of significant physical and emotional harm and the overall neglect of their basic care needs.  AB has failed to ensure the basic care needs of X and Y have been met in that she has failed to ensure their regular and timely attendance at school and nursery, thus impairing their educational and social development.

���������������������������������������������������������������� JUDGMENT

������������������������������������������������������������������ (Approved)

 

��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������� 

Friday,
14th February 2014.

 

01����� This
case concerns six children: MR (born 9th February 2001); CL (born 3rd
January 2003); SL (born 19th December 2003); AL (born 28th
July 2005); MKL (born 7th August 2008); and LL (born 29th
December 2010).� The parents of MR are the Second Respondent father F and the
Third Respondent mother MG.� The parents of the other children are the First
Respondent mother ML and the Second Respondent father F.� F has parental
responsibility for all of the children save CL.

 

Background
to the proceedings 

 

MR.

 

02����� The
local authority became involved with MR in about 2001 when concerns were
expressed about the care he was receiving from his mother MG.� MR was
subsequently placed with his paternal grandmother who cared for him until she
died in 2012.� During this period MR lost contact with his mother and his
half-sibling C.� At the time of his grandmother�s death F was in an on-off
relationship with ML, the mother of his other children and she agreed to
support his care of MR.� In between his grandmother�s death on 22nd
August 2012 and his accommodation pursuant to Section 20 on 16th
July 2013 MR moved a number of different times within the care of his paternal
family.� He lived with his uncle SP, his father F and ML, then with his father
alone, with his father and KP, DP , ML and also at a family of friends known as
the D family.� Eventually MR found his way to ML�s home from the D family,
claiming that his dad had �done a runner.�� It was from ML�s home that
MR was accommodated.� The final welfare hearing for MR has been adjourned by
the court to a date subsequent to the completion of a parenting assessment of
his mother MG with whom he has now re-established contact and who wishes to
care for him.� His involvement and MG�s involvement in this hearing has been
solely on the issue of threshold in relation to MR which was resolved by
agreement on Day 1 and also in relation to contact to his half-siblings, the L
children.� Consequently when those issues were resolved by agreement his
advocate Miss Stevens withdrew from the hearing further.

 

The
L children.

 

03����� The
L children came to the attention of the local authority in 2006 as a result of
concerns about father�s criminal offending, his alcohol and drug misuse,
domestic violence between him and ML.� The children remained in the care of the
parents.� Concerns resurfaced in 2011 with further referrals with regard to domestic
incidents between the parents and continuing concerns about the father�s
substance misuse, the neglect of the children and suggestions from the children
on occasions that they had been inappropriately physically chastised.� The
relationship between the parents appears to have been characterised by a high
degree of conflict and repeated separations during which threats, including
threats to kill, were alleged by the mother followed by subsequent
reconciliations.� In early 2012 the children were made subject to a Child
Protection plan under the category of neglect.� In about March father appears
to have moved out of the family home for a couple of months.� There were
increasing concerns about CL�s disruptive behaviour.� He absconded from the
family home for short periods of time and he alleged that he had been assaulted
by LD, a friend of the family.� The local authority tried to support the
parents� care of the children with a number of interventions.� The father was
referred to New Paths domestic violence service for men; the mother booked
herself on to the Freedom Program; and the mother engaged with Fledglings.� On
13th November the decision of the Child Protection conference was to
remove the children from the Child Protection plan and place them on a Child In
Need plan.� It is said that this decision reflects the positive progress made
but having reviewed the chronology � none of which has been challenged within
these proceedings � that would appear to have been a surprising decision; for
example, at the beginning of November F alleged that there had been a threat by
his brother SP to �smash his head in� i.e. F�s head in �and smash his
partner�s head in.�� F was reported as saying that this was a credible
threat and that therefore he had stayed overnight at the family home.� In any
event by February 2013 the decision of the Child In Need meeting was to remove
the children from Child In Need plans. Agreements with the parents included
work with the professionals including the following work; the family continuing
to work with Fledglings and being supported by health visitors, school nurse,
the school and other professionals.� The parents were encouraged to refrain
from exposing the children to conflict and the case was then closed in February
2013.� 

 

04����� Exactly
a month later, on 11th March 2013, a referral relating to the family
was received from the school. A further NSPCC referral in April reported
concerns of the children being physically harmed and neglected, and raised once
again the former concerns.� The case was reopened to Social Care and a Child In
Need meeting convened.� The mother was unhappy at Social Care�s involvement but
a plan was devised for ongoing support including support from Fledglings,
therapeutic support for the children, and Think Family.� The latter support was
declined by mother initially but subsequently accepted by her.� Attempts were
made to improve the state of the family home.� Concerns continued regarding the
continuing volatility in the parents� relationship, the father�s substance
misuse and the mother�s friendship with LD.� CL�s behaviour had resulted in the
mother�s having to call the police on a number of occasions.� These concerns
continued and escalated, culminating in reports at the end of July that SP made
serious threats to ML as a result of a dispute over a debt that he said she
owed to him.� Police intervention at the time appeared to increase SP�s anger
over the alleged dispute and the local authority subsequently took the decision
to issue proceedings.� An Emergency Protection Order was granted in relation to
the five L children on 2nd August 2013 and they were placed in
foster care.� 

 

05����� During
these proceedings there have been a range of assessments, ongoing social work
assessment, viability assessments of family members, assessments by Linda Sansom,
an independent social worker of the mother and father, psychological
assessments of the children by Tammy Surgenor.� Dr Surgenor conducted a
comprehensive assessment including observations of family members� contact.�
She concluded that the needs of the children were such that they should not be
placed together.� Very quickly after being placed in foster care CL started to
abscond and I am told that he absconded up to 45 times from foster care.� When
he absconded he went to his maternal grandmother�s home or to the home of his
uncle RL.� His maternal aunt CN was positively assessed and for a period CL
lived with her along with his mother, but by September maternal grandmother had
put herself forward to care for CL and the aunt had decided that she did not
want the mother to continue to reside with her nor did she want to look after
CL in the longer term.� It was agreed eventually following local authority
assessment that he should move to live with his grandmother.� He moved there on
18th October 2013 and has settled very well into that placement.�
His grandmother is providing very well for his care and his behaviour has
improved significantly.� All parties in this case agree that CL should remain
placed with his grandmother MGM.� Having considered the evidence about the
progress made by CL within that placement I made a residence order in the
maternal grandmother�s favour on 2nd December 2013.� She has
attended and participated in hearings since that date but she also attended
prior to that date to provide the M with support. At the conclusion of this
hearing all parties agree that I should make a special guardianship order in
relation to CL in her favour.� 

 

06����� SL
has been placed separately from her siblings in foster care.� She has settled
well.� There appears to have been a plan to test out a prospective placement of
SL with the maternal grandmother and CL towards the latter part of last year
but Dr Surgenor expressed concern about whether or not this would destabilise
CL�s placement in an email dated 18th November which set out her
preliminary findings.� As a result of this it appears that the plan to try SL
within the placement with maternal grandmother was not implemented.� At the
beginning of this hearing the local authority plan for SL was to invite the
court to approve a care order on the basis that she would remain placed in
long-term foster care separate from her siblings with ongoing contact to her
family.� This was opposed by all of the parties including the guardian who
recommended that there should be further exploration of the possibility of
placing SL with CL and the grandmother MGM.� At the conclusion of Dr Surgenor�s
evidence, which was almost at the end of the first week of this hearing, the
local authority reflected on its plan and decided to agree to explore this
option for SL by way of further assessment.� A revised care plan has been
submitted to the court D175-176 and this is a plan which is put forward on the
basis that it is agreed by all parties.

 

07����� AL
and MKL have been placed together in the same placement.� Initially MKL was
placed with LL but as a result of his violent behaviour towards her he was
moved and placed with AL.� Once MKL moved into the foster placement with AL, AL�s behaviour is described as having deteriorated and both boys have displayed quite
destructive behaviour in their placement.� AL is eight; he has a Statement of
Special Educational Needs as a result of learning difficulties.� The local
authority plan for AL is to attempt to secure an adoptive placement for him.�
In advance of this hearing the local authority set out its care plan which
provided that AL should move from his present foster care into a bridging
placement.� Such a plan was opposed by F, who wished to put himself forward to
care for AL.� However, at the beginning of the hearing having had an
opportunity to reflect on the final evidence F decided that his plan was not
viable.� He accepts that he needs more time to demonstrate that he can continue
to progress in relation to his substance misuse and continue to sustain changes
to his lifestyle.� However, he, along with ML, opposes a placement order in
respect of AL.� At the beginning of the hearing the guardian opposed AL�s care plan but on the last day of the hearing the local authority amended its plan to
provide for a parallel search for adopters and foster carers for AL on the basis that he would not be moved from his present carer until a placement was
secured.� His guardian now supports that plan.

 

08����� MKL
is five.� He has exhibited difficult behaviours.� The local authority plan is
that MKL should be adopted.� His parents do not put themselves forward to care
for him but his uncle RL applied shortly before this hearing for leave to apply
for a special guardianship order.� ML and F supported RL�s application.� The
local authority and the guardian opposed it.� RL has not been represented
within these proceedings but with the agreement of all parties I allowed
disclosure of relevant documentation to him and on occasions assisted him with
questions to witnesses whose evidence he wished to challenge.� In addition I am
very grateful to Mr Lefteri, who represents MGM.� The grandmother had supported
RL�s proposal and Mr Lefteri in effect acted as his advocate within this hearing
and put forward his case to the witnesses as if RL had leave to make that
application.� This enabled the court to fully consider RL�s position.� However,
having put forward his case fully to all of the professional witnesses and
having heard the evidence-in-chief of the guardian, RL reflected overnight
about his application for leave to apply for a special guardianship order for
MKL.� He decided that he needed to prioritise his own son C� in respect of whom
there have been problematic historic contact disputes.� He withdrew his
application for leave.� Although the guardian agreed the plan for adoption for
MKL, she disagreed with the local authority about how best to implement it.�
The local authority proposes to leave MKL in his present placement and the
guardian thought that MKL should be moved into a bridging placement and then on
from there.� However, on the final day, having seen the revised care plan which
provided for a parallel plan to search for both adoptive and foster care
placements, thus reducing any prospective delay, the guardian changed her
position and offered support to the local authority�s plan.� 

 

09����� LL
is placed in foster care.� She is aged three.� The impression I have from the
papers is that she is an intelligent and a feisty little character.� Her speech
is advanced for her age.� There have been a number of concerns about the care
she has received in foster care which have been raised during the course of
this hearing.� It is not necessary within this judgment to deal with those matters.�
LL�s mother wishes to resume her care and seeks a further period during which
this option can be assessed and the family supports this proposal.� The local
authority and the guardian recommend a care and placement order but the
guardian thinks that some preparatory work will be necessary with LL.� However,
that does not alter the guardian�s view that LL is ready to be adopted and
should be adopted.� 

 

10����� It
can be seen from the outline of the parties� positions that the landscape of
this case has changed quite dramatically during the course of what has been a
long hearing.� A lot of evidence has been given in relation to issues which are
no longer live issues between the parties.� The orders which I am invited to
make by agreement are a special guardianship order in relation to CL to the
maternal grandmother; secondly, an interim care order in relation to SL to the
local authority on the basis of an interim care plan for testing out a
placement or SL to be placed with her grandmother.� The issues in the case
which I have to determine are firstly whether or not a care order on the basis
of care plans for AL and MKL to be adopted can and should be approved, it being
conceded that they will not return to their family�s care; secondly, whether or
not AL or MKL should be made the subject of placement orders; thirdly, whether
or not LL should be made the subject of a care and placement order or remain in
the interim care of the local authority pending a further assessment of the
mother as a prospective carer for LL alone.� Whilst opposing the local
authority�s plans for placements, the parties have agreed the amended contact
plans at D177 of the bundle.

 

The
law.

 

11����� A
court cannot make a care order unless the circumstances at the relevant date
are as set out in Section 31 Children Act: that the child concerned is
suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm attributable to the care
given to the child or likely to be given to him if the order were not made not
being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him.� 

 

12����� If
the threshold for the making of an order is established I must then consider
the local authority plans for these children keeping their welfare as my
paramount consideration.� I must take into account all of the relevant circumstances
in the case but in particular those matters set out in Section 1(3) Children
Act 1989.� I must remember that any delay in determining the welfare decision
is likely to prejudice their welfare and I remind myself that I should not make
an order unless I consider that it would be better to do so than not.� Article
8 and Article 6 of the ECHR are engaged in relation to this application.�� 

 

13����� The
local authority applies for orders the effect of which contemplates a permanent
separation of AL, MKL and LL from their birth family.�� Following recent
decisions in the cases of Re B (A child) [2013] UKSC 33, Re G (A
child) [2013] EWCA Civ 965, Re P (A child) [2013] EWCA Civ 963, K
v LB Brent [2013] EWCA Civ 926, B-S (Children) [2013] UK 1146, and W
(A child) v Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council [2013] EWCA Civ 1125 I
must consider whether or not the permanent removal of these children from their
birth family is proportionate to the risk of harm to them in their family�s
care or the risks associated with removal.� In evaluating which set of
arrangements for their future are to be endorsed, the children�s welfare is
paramount.� I must not approach the task of deciding whether or not to approve
care plans in a linear way by considering the option of whichever family member
puts themselves forward and then arriving by default at the local authority
plan.�� I must undertake a global holistic evaluation of each of the options
available for their future upbringing before deciding which of those options
best meets the duty to afford paramount consideration to their welfare.�� I
must set out clear reasoning based on the evidence including assessing the
benefits and detriments of each option for placement; in particular the nature
and extent of the risk involved in each of the options must be included, and
where removal from a relative is proposed that must be analysed as a welfare
factor.� I remind myself that an order severing the ties between a child and
his parents can only be made where it is justified by the overriding
requirement pertaining to the child�s interests.� Adoption is a very extreme
thing, a last resort, as Lord Neuberger reminded� in Re B.� 

 

14����� In
considering the local authority�s application for placement orders in respect
of AL, MKL and LL again I must have the children�s welfare as my paramount
consideration and must bear in mind that any delay is likely to prejudice their
welfare, and pay particular regard to the matters set out in Section 1(4)
Adoption and Children Act 2002.� I cannot make a placement order unless the
circumstances are as set out in Sections 21(2) and 21(3) Adoption and Children
Act 2002.�� Section 21(3) requires the court to examine whether or not parental
consent has been given and if not to consider whether or not to consent with
that consent as set out in Section 52 of the Act.� In this case the parents do
not and will not consent.� In deciding whether or not to dispense with their
consent, I must be satisfied that adoption is in each child�s interests and
that their welfare requires the court to dispense with their parents� consent.�
In considering whether or not to make a placement order I must have each
child�s welfare throughout their lives as my paramount consideration, and as I
have said, take into account all of the matters referred to in Section 1 of
that Act.� 

 

15����� A
placement order is not something which follows automatically from the making of
a care order even where the care plan is for adoption.� I should only make such
an order where I am satisfied that all avenues to rehabilitation have
reasonably been explored and that each child is ready to be adopted.� In
relation to evaluating whether or not the child is ready to be adopted, where
work, for example, therapy with that child needs to be undertaken there is a distinction
between cases where the child�s difficulties are such that it is not possible
to determine whether or not a child should be adopted until that work is
undertaken and cases where the work that a child should undertake is
preparatory to placement for adoption.� The fact that it may be difficult to
secure an appropriate adoptive placement is not a reason to conclude that
adoption is not in a child�s best interests.� I refer to the following
authorities: Re T (Placement order) [2008] EWCA Civ 248; Re P
(Placement orders, parental consent) [2008] EWCA Civ 535; Re F (A child)
[2013] EWCA Civ 1277.�� 

 

16����� The
standard of proof in relation to any dispute in facts is the civil standard of
proof, the balance of probabilities, and the burden in this case rests with the
local authority; it is not reversible.� It is not for the Respondents to
establish that allegations are not made out.� Findings of fact must be based on
evidence and not speculation.� When carrying out an assessment of the evidence
I remind myself that if a court concludes a witness has lied about a matter, it
does not follow that he has lied about everything.� A witness may lie for many
reasons; out of shame, humiliation, misplaced loyalty, panic, fear, distress,
confusion and emotional pressure.� R v Lucas [1981] QB 720.

 

Evidence.

 

17����� The
written evidence in this case extends over five files, reflecting the
significant involvement of the local authority in the lives of these children.�
I have heard oral evidence from Dr Surgenor, Mr Britton of the Marigold Family
Centre, Linda Sansom,� EW (social worker), LB (Adoption social worker), Tony
Versaca, SL, F, MGM, RL and the guardian Linda Gillespie.� I am going to focus
in the judgment on the evidence relevant to the decisions I have to take at the
conclusion of the hearing.� This means much of the evidence in the first week
of the hearing, which focused on the SL and CL proposal, will not be set out
save in so far as I need to consider this evidence in order to approve the
agreed orders and in order to inform the decisions I make in relation to the
other children.� I have obviously considered all of the evidence I have read
and heard very carefully but in what is already going to be a very long
judgment this judgment will be far too long and repetitive if I go through and
try to deal with all of it.

 

18����� EW
gave evidence and put forward the local authority�s plans for the children.�
She had been the social worker since May 2013.� She gave evidence over a couple
of days.� Other witnesses were interposed.� This meant she was unable to react
to the emerging evidence by providing instructions as to the changes in the
care plan as the case proceeded and it did leave her � in particular on the
issue of the SL and CL proposal, and the contact proposals � in what I think
was the unenviable position of trying to defend the local authority�s care
plans on these issues which during the first week started to look untenable.�
She was clearly a caring social worker but I felt that her evidence on some
issues lacked the sort of detailed analysis which is required in a case of this
complexity.� This had the effect that when challenged about a part of the plan
� for example, contact � she tended to say �Well yes, we will take that on
board� and I had to remind her on a number of occasions that it was not much
use for a local authority to take such points on board after the hearing
because I needed to know what the plan was during the hearing and before I
reached a decision.� In making that criticism I do acknowledge that the case on
welfare for these children because of the number of them and the constellation
of difficulties they have demonstrated in placement has been complicated.�
Almost as soon as she had completed her evidence she instructed her counsel
that the plans for CL and SL should be changed to allow for the testing out of
the placement of SL with the grandmother and she also instructed about changes
to the contact plans.� 

 

19����� On
the final day of the hearing, having heard the guardian�s evidence, the local
authority changed its plans again and provided for a parallel search for
adopters and foster carers for AL and MKL.� It was unfortunate for there to be
a further change in the local authority�s plan at this very late stage in the
hearing.� Unsurprisingly, this caused consternation on the part of the
Respondents.� I directed the social worker to be recalled to give evidence
together with the guardian who supported the revised plans.� 

 

20����� It
was equally unfortunate, in my view, that the local authority had taken advice
overnight from David Britton from the Marigold Centre.� Mr Britton had given
evidence earlier on in the hearing about the advice he had given the local
authority historically about CL.� When he gave evidence the plan for SL was
still in issue.� He had told me that he was aware of the other children and had
sat in on meetings regarding them but he had never met them and had therefore
only a glancing acquaintance with the issues relating to them.� I cannot
imagine why the local authority thought it sensible to consult with Mr Britton
in this way at the eleventh hour most of the way through the hearing.�
Furthermore I do not really understand why having done so the local authority
did not immediately provide all parties with the typed note which I directed
them to file and serve on the last day of the hearing which set out the summary
of the advice that he gave.� I accept that a local authority must consult with
professionals in order to exercise its parental responsibility but it should
have consulted the parents before so doing.� This is particularly so in
circumstances where the case is part-heard at the final hearing.� The local
authority should have known that its actions, taken without consultation with
the parents, would have the appearance of unfairness. When I saw the typed
note, it became clear that what had been set out in that note was with regard
to CL, AL and MKL mainly related to the implementation of the local authority�s
plans for them in anticipation of those being approved by the court.� Matters
that did not fall within the remit of implementation concerned the issue of
LL�s sexualised behaviour.� This issue was already before the court in evidence
and in fact the witness had been asked about it by Miss Dooley when he gave
evidence but at that point in his evidence he acknowledged that he had never
met LL but had been asked by the local authority if he could provide some
advice to her carers and that part of the note updates on his advice to the
foster carers.� To the extent that it strays into assessment and analysis in
relation to causation of that behaviour I disregard that note.� Firstly, Mr
Britton had never met any of the children other than CL and any views he
expresses are not views to which the court should therefore attach weight;
secondly, he did not give evidence on the note and was not cross-examined on
it.� 

 

21����� So
the local authority�s settled plans were special guardianship order of CL to
the grandmother; trial of SL with grandmother with an adjournment of her case
under an interim care order; care and placement orders in respect of the three
younger children on the basis of the parallel search for foster carers and
adopters for AL and MKL, and the revised contact plan, as I have said, was
agreed by the parties.

 

22����� LB
was the Adoption and Family Finding social worker who has prepared statements
and given oral evidence.� It seemed that she had very little experience.� She
had only joined the department in July, had not ever completed the placement of
children for adoption, but she had two of them which had been matched.� The
ages of those children were under one, and one to two; as such, it seemed to me
that she was a surprising choice to work this case and then to give evidence to
the court.� She could not really help as a result of her lack of experience on
the impact of attachment difficulties and sexualised behaviours on timescales
and likelihood of securing appropriate placements.� She provided some
statistics about 100 adopters being available on the National Register but
agreed that those statistics were not really useful if looked at in isolation
of the number of children awaiting placements.� In light of her lack of
experience I did not find her evidence of particular assistance.

 

23����� David
Britton from the Marigold had been involved, as I have said, in assisting on
CL�s case.� He prepared a statement setting out his involvement.� It is
unnecessary to consider that in light of the agreed way forward for CL.� During
the course of his evidence he was asked about what work could be undertaken
with LL�s carers about sexualised behaviour.� LL has been demonstrating this
behaviour by masturbating and making herself sore.� He explained that he was
not someone who had expertise in relation to sexualised behaviour in the sense
that he could provide any sort of opinion as to its causation but he did say
that he would be able to work with LL�s foster carer on strategies to help LL
move on and observed it was common to see this sort of behaviour in Looked
After Children either because of a normal exploration of the body or because it
was a sort of self-soothing behaviour.

 

24����� Linda
Sansom gave evidence before me.� She is an independent social worker who had
conducted an assessment of mother and father separately.� Her relevant evidence
for this hearing was on the issue of whether or not mother should have an
opportunity for a further assessment.� Her report does not really provide a
clear recommendation and it was a report which I read in advance of the hearing
and felt that it lacked detail and analysis.� My expectations for her oral
evidence were low.� In the event I found her quite an impressive and persuasive
witness.� She came down off the fence in favour of mother having an opportunity
for a further assessment.� She felt that mother had moved on and was showing
real insight into what had gone wrong with the older children.� She had been
very young when she had entered the relationship with F.� The family thought
that F had been controlling; that they had not known the extent of what was
going on at the time.� Miss Samson met with RL and the maternal grandmother and
told me she had been very impressed with the family.� She thought they were
close and supportive of one another.� It was a positive factor that mother
lived close to them. �Mother had done a lot of work since she had separated
from F, engaging at Parklands, undertaking counselling, the Freedom Program,
and she wanted to do other courses.� Miss Sansom�s impression was that she was
someone who was trying to change her life and her style of parenting and she
wanted to be a good parent to LL.� Her family felt she had made positive
changes too.� 

 

25����� She
saw the mother and LL alone which Dr Surgenor had not the opportunity to do
during her assessment, and she disagreed with Dr Surgenor�s description of the
difficulties in the mother/child interaction; but she did accept that she had
only seen them together over a relatively short period of time, and was not an
expert in attachment.� She accepted Dr Surgenor�s evidence that LL probably had
a lot of attachment issues.� When she had seen LL alone with her mother she did
not see anything which concerned her.� Mother had responded to her and she had
responded to her mother�s attention positively.� LL had been calm, happy and
relaxed.� In addition she felt that the contact supervisor had been a little
domineering and had strong opinions which she voiced, telling Linda Sansom that
she did not think LL should live with her mother.� In light of the positives
she outlined she thought that the responsibility of only one child may well be
something which the mother could manage and she recommended that work be
undertaken prior to any final decision in respect of LL.� She noted there had
been no assessment of mother with LL alone.� She felt that the sexualised
behaviour needed to be looked at before LL was placed anywhere.� However, when
cross-examined she agreed that the clock was ticking for LL in terms of
placement and also agreed that the decision was a difficult one.� It was about
balancing risks.� There would be risks to LL if any prospective placement with
mother broke down and she agreed this would be devastating to LL, as it would
be to any child, but she also went on to observe that she had sufficient
experience to know that adoption was not always a wonderful option and there
were risks of placement breakdown in adoptive placements.� The implications of
adoption for LL would be that she would lose contact with her family of
origin.� She agreed when cross-examined that it was early days in the mother�s
engagement with change and she could not answer whether or not that could be
sustained.� On balance she felt that there was some mileage in further
assessment of mother and LL and she told me she thought there was �some
hope.�� She was positive about F�s contact with AL and said dad was an
important figure to AL.� As I have said, I thought she presented in a
persuasive way.

 

26����� F
gave evidence before me.� He admitted very frankly that much of what was set
out in the police bundle at J was true.� He accepted responsibility together
with ML for the harm that the children had suffered.� He acknowledged his
longstanding problems with substance misuse.� He had told Linda Sansom he had a
history of cocaine use extending back over 20 years.� He was now engaged in
attempting to deal with that issue and move on with his life but he accepted
that the timescales for him to be able to demonstrate a sustainable recovery
would be outside the timescales for the children.� He had hoped to be able to
offer a home for AL but he realised now that would not be possible.� He
supported the mother in her attempt to resume the care of LL and he supported
both CL and SL being placed with the grandmother.� He would not interfere with
that placement and he would abide by restrictions on his contact.� He did not
think that the younger children should be adopted and thought it would be
better for them to be in long-term foster care.

 

27����� RL
gave evidence.� It is unnecessary to deal with the part of the evidence which
related to his own application but he told me in a way that indicated he was
quite genuine in his feelings that he supported his sister caring for LL and
would also provide what support was required of him in relation to his mother�s
care of CL and SL.

 

28����� MGM
thought that SL should be placed with her and CL.� CL had settled into her care
very well.� When he first came to her he was unsettled, unsure and a little
anxious but she thought he was a different person now.� He was doing extremely
well and enjoyed his work, which was not the situation previously.� He had made
new friends and was going to judo.� He even had a girlfriend.� She told me that
he smiles all the time and his behaviour was in her words �brilliant.�� He has
put on weight and is proud of himself.� She noted he would spend time in front
of the mirror these days making himself look nice and he seemed to always want
to go into the shower.� MGM said when he asked how he looked she always
complimented him.� He was content to have contact to his parents but was always
happy to come home.� She was now focused on getting him the right schooling.�
She had identified a suitable school and hoped the transition could be managed
by September.� It would be a gradual process.� She thought she would be able to
manage both SL and CL.� She used to have them to stay regularly.� CL wanted SL
to come and live with them and she was also willing to supervise F�s contact.� 

 

29����� When
the grandmother was cross-examined by the mother she was asked about occasions
in the past when the mother had fled the marital home following arguments and
grandmother had driven her back to the marital home.� The point the mother
appeared to be making was that the grandmother had in some way returned her
when she was not keen to go or had colluded with F in her return.� She was a
little upset about this line of questioning.� Although Miss Dooley for the
mother was keen to resist any suggestion that the mother was intending to
offend the maternal grandmother or minimise her own responsibility in past
failings, I agree with the grandmother and the local authority that this line
of questioning was another way in which the mother minimised her responsibility
for what had happened.� With regard to the mother MGM said that she had seen a
real change in the mother.� She thought mother was more assertive and
self-assured and she felt confident she would be able to care for one child.�
She reassured the court she would be on hand and she would alert Social
Services if history repeated itself.

 

30����� ML�s
oral evidence commenced on the Friday of the first week and concluded
subsequently so she gave her evidence in two stages.� She accepted
responsibility for what had happened to the children and was keen to impress on
me that she had changed.� She had separated from F and there was no going
back.� She was hoping to move away from her old home into new accommodation
suitable for LL.�� That should be available within a few weeks.� She would be
closer to her family and to support.� In her statement she said: 

 

��������� �I
do not like having to admit it but the children�s lives were chaotic and they
would have felt frightened and insecure too often.� The more children I had the
worse it got.� There did not seem to be time to think about the situation.� I
shut out the children�s reactions as it was painful for me to see them suffer
and not be able to do anything about it, as that is how it felt at the time.�
It was horrible.� I really thought I could change F .� I thought he loved me
enough to change.�� 

 

��������� She
had done a Positive Parenting course; she had just started a new Freedom
Program which was more intensive than the one she had undertaken in 2012.� In
November 2013 she began counselling sessions at Parklands connected to the
Women�s Refuge.� She said this work was intensive and told me it �goes quite
deep.�� She had not missed a session and was determined to continue to
attend.� In April she is due to start another course called Reclaiming
Ourselves.� In addition she said that the assessment with Dr Surgenor had been
helpful in assisting her to understand what had gone wrong in the past.� As
part of her developing insight she had decided not to support AL�s being placed
with F.� She said she could see now that the relationship with F had not been
good for the children and she accepted that they had been exposed to a great
deal of conflict.� She thought she would be able to manage with LL.� There
would be only one child and she had found the boys very difficult to handle.�
Having CL in the house had made everything very difficult as she could not
really manage him.� She had taken help from Social Care and she was prepared to
continue to cooperate with the local authority.� She told me she accepted the
older children should not return to her care.� 

 

31����� I
asked her about the police reports of incidents in Section J.� With a few
amendments she accepted that these reports made by her were true accounts of
incidents which had occurred.� She told me that during the occasions when CL
had been out of control and on the occasions when there had been incidents of
domestic violence or threats of arguments which the children had witnessed they
had been very scared and frightened, and she told me that the children had
cried on those occasions.� 

 

32����� LD
was not really referred to in her written evidence but he features as a
significant and seemingly malign individual in the police disclosure.� In that
Section of the bundle he is described in ML�s complaints as having assaulted CL
and having threatened her.� She told me that he was aged about 17 when she
first met him; he was a mutual friend of hers and F�s and he remained a friend
until the children were removed from her care.� She thought that he was using
drugs.� Her friendship with LD was on/off but when she had split up from F she
had started to lean on LD for emotional support.� She leaned on him as well
because she was finding CL difficult to manage.� He would be around the house.�
She had thought that he was good with CL because he had suffered from similar
difficulties to CL in his life.� She explained that he had ADHD.� She described
his behaviour as hyperactive; he would always want to make jokes; he tended to
move around the room very quickly.� She accepted that he had slept over at her
property on a couple of occasions.� She thought that he really understood CL
and had been good with him.� She was asked then how it was that he had been
reported as having assaulted CL by kicking him in the genitals.� She told me
that LD had an issue with her; that he had come to her house, CL had been outside
and complained that as he came in he kicked him in his genitals.� Afterwards
she told me that she had asked LD about it and he denied the assault.� She told
me that it was difficult to know who to believe in those circumstances.� She
had reported it to the police but nothing came of it and it seemed that she had
then resumed her friendship with LD.� She did not really know when asked what
effect this would have had on CL.� 

 

33����� When
she resumed her evidence she told me she could see it was probably not a good
idea but she persisted to say that LD had been good with CL and she thought
that he had helped her to calm CL down.� I asked her if the children were
frightened of LD and she agreed that they might have been.� She said that she
had not been frightened of him but she probably should have been.� She agreed
it had been wrong to allow the situation with LD to continue and that it was
not in CL�s interests to have him around but she explained: 

 

��������� �The
other children liked LD .� I don�t know if they were saying that because there
was a level of fear.� He did shout at them, but he can come across as scatty
and intimidating.�� 

 

��������� She
also said: 

 

��������� �It
was a very confusing time for me.� I don�t know why I let him in.� I lost
control of my children and was trying to get relief and help from wherever.�� 

 

34����� What
was striking about the mother�s evidence was that when she resumed her evidence
she moved quickly to distance herself from the answers she had given about LD
and was keen to stress that he had been a bad influence and she did not think
he had been good with CL at all.� Whilst it was obviously heartening to hear
the mother change her evidence about LD, I thought that it sounded rehearsed.�
I thought she was saying what she needed to say.� I find that the evidence she
gave about LD when she was first being asked about him represented her true
feelings about the role he had assumed in the family�s life.� I find she did
think that he had helped her with CL. I find also that she had not known
whether to believe CL�s allegation of assault.� Despite not knowing, she had
allowed LD back into her home and into the lives of her children and she
appeared to have accepted when his shouting at them.� Towards the end of her
evidence the mother became tearful and was protesting that nobody had helped
her.� 

 

35����� At
the conclusion of the mother�s evidence I was satisfied that she was making an
effort to turn her life around and had separated from F; that she had been
telling the truth about the incidents that are recorded in the police evidence
at J; that she loved her children; that she was committed to caring for LL; and
that she had not engaged openly with her family about the extent of her
problems.� However, I also thought that she had focused the cause of her
family�s problems on the domestic violence between herself and F.� Whilst this
obviously played a significant part in the experiences the children had, the
fact is that after that relationship ended they were exposed to continuing harm
as a result of her friendship with LD.� During that period LD is said to have
assaulted CL and threatened her.� The history of repetitive dependence on
unsuitable men indicates a vulnerability and a neediness in this mother.� It
appears that she transferred her dependence from F to LD.� I think in the
evidence she gave she minimised her own responsibility for the current
situation.� Despite saying she accepted it, I did not think she really
understood the extent of her own involvement.� For example, she had sought to
deflect criticism away from herself and on to her mother in the
cross-examination of her mother by suggesting or implying that it was her
mother�s fault that she had reconciled with F.� In addition, she had sought to
explain her continuing friendship with LD on the basis that he had actually
been a help to her and CL.� In the context of what can be gleaned about him
from the police material this, I am afraid, was a woeful misjudgment.� 

 

36����� Thirdly,
at the end of her evidence she was in tears and saying that nobody had helped
her when I am afraid the history in this case points very clearly in the other
direction.� She chose her relationships with F and LD and she chose to continue
those relationships.� Her children had no choice and had to live with the
consequence of the choices that she made.� In so doing she failed to prioritise
her children or demonstrate an appropriate instinctive protective quality which
is an essential ingredient, in my judgment, of good parenting.� She exposed her
children to continuing significant harm.� When she was asked about how CL must
have been upset about her continuing friendship with LD following LD�s alleged
assault of him, she gave the impression in the witness box that she was
thinking about this issue for the first time and it seemed almost to take her
by surprise that it might have been difficult for CL to see LD around the house
and in a continuing friendship with her.� I felt that a lot of what she said in
evidence about acknowledging the children�s experiences was what she thought she
had to say to get LL back, and this impression I am afraid was reinforced by
her tears at the end of her evidence which were not in fact about the plight of
her children but about her own predicament.

 

37����� The
guardian had prepared a number of reports which are in the bundle.� She
supported a trial of SL with CL and the maternal grandmother.� I am not going
to deal with the detail of her evidence on this uncontentious point.� She
thought all of the children displayed insecure attachments.� She thought that the
moves for the children needed to be kept to a minimum because of this.� She
felt there was no perfect solution for these children; it was a difficult
balancing exercise.� She had been worried about supporting the care plan for
adoption for AL.� He had displayed difficult behaviours including sexualised
behaviours.� She thought it would be difficult to find adopters for him at his
age.� She did not want him set up for adoption and then disappointed.� He was a
bit like the Artful Dodger � he had a lovely personality but underneath she
thought he was quite difficult to manage.� His behaviour had deteriorated
significantly since MKL moved into his foster placement.� He had told her that
he did not want adoptive placements but MKL might.� Apparently after she had
left he told the foster carer he might want a new mum and dad.� 

 

38����� MKL
had difficult behaviours and on her visits he tended to fly around and not
really speak to her or engage with her but he did come and rest his head on her
lap when she was reading a story.� She tended to think his sexualised
behaviours might be exploration.� His violent behaviours had been concerning
and she told me about the occasion when he tried to strangle LL.� She thought
he was very needy and would require a family with a male and female carer.� He
probably needed to be Statemented.� She had been anxious about AL and MKL remaining in the same placement, one moving on to adoption with the other left
behind.� She was worried about MKL�s lack of progress.� He had been placed in the
Nurture Group at school but made no progress.� She thought it would take about
a year to find an adoptive placement for MKL.� She was clear that whatever the
outcome AL should not be told if the plan for adoption for him was approved,
that that was the plan, as it would be very difficult for him to accept MKL
being selected and placed for adoption and his being left behind.� She had
thought that they should not remain in the same placement after this hearing.�
However, on the last day after the local authority had changed its plan so that
it would conduct a parallel search for adopters for both MKL and AL she had
changed her mind and decided to support the making of a placement order.� She
was cross-examined about the change of recommendation given her previous
opposition to the placement for AL, but she explained she thought this plan
would involve the widest trawl of potential carers and the best chance of
securing the right placement.� Her preference on behalf of the children would
always be for the most secure form of placement and in her view that was
adoption.� If the right adopters could be found, this was what was best for the
children.� 

 

39����� Regarding
LL, she felt that she had been quite impressed by Linda Sansom�s evidence and
she told me that she had started to question her recommendation when she heard
her evidence, but that after mother gave evidence she reverted to thinking that
adoption was in LL�s best interests.� She told me she thought she had �a
long way to go before she took responsibility and stopped pointing the finger
at anyone else.�� She felt mother�s problems had been ongoing for a long
time and that she demonstrated little understanding or empathy for the
children�s experiences.� Although she had made progress, it was not enough.� In
addition to the deficits in her own parenting, the fact was that these children
� and LL included in that � are now exhibiting a range of difficult behaviours;
they had had no boundaries at home; LL would need experienced and very
competent carers.� LL was displaying some sexualised behaviour and rubbing
herself so that she was sore.� She had advised the local authority to start
working with the carers about this and had some concerns that the foster carer
had made too much of it.� She thought it could be soothing behaviour and it
should have been ignored.� It was difficult to say.� 

 

Threshold.

 

40����� The
threshold for the making of orders is conceded by both parents.� I have looked
at the agreed documents and I accept and approve these threshold documents as a
succinct summary of the concerns about the care received and likely to be
received by each of the children.� However, there are other matters set out in
the police documentation which are agreed by the mother and broadly agreed by
the father, and I have decided that it is important in this case to record
certain additional findings in order to place the children�s experiences in
their proper context.� Therefore I am going to make the following findings in
relation to the history.

 

41����� Having
heard the evidence I find that there were a constellation of escalating and
serious concerns in relation to the care provided to the children by the mother
and father.� These are set out comprehensively in Section J of the bundle
containing police material in relation to a� number of callouts in the main to
the family home.� The mother asserts that these incidents occurred.� She was
not challenged in cross-examination by F about the incidents which relate to
him, and F accepts that what is set out in Section J is broadly accurate whilst
not necessarily conceding all of the detail, and so I find that the following
accounts are broadly accurate.� 

 

42����� In
so far as incidents between ML and F are concerned, on about 18th
April 2011 during an argument at the family home witnessed by the children the
mother asked the father to leave; he threatened her that he would get an �Irish
pikey� that he knew to come and get her in a white van and chop her up and bury
her so that she did not have the children; the mother left the premises with
the children in fear.� 

 

43����� On
17th April 2011 father came over to the family home to see the
children; he refused to leave; threatened to get the mother �smashed up.�� He
finally left at 11 pm.� When the mother went downstairs the following morning
the father was sitting in the front room saying that he climbed the drainpipe
and got in through the bathroom window.� The mother asked him to leave again.�
He refused and became aggressive and abusive and threatened to have the mother
killed.� He also threatened the children.� At around this time he was spending
approximately �120 on cannabis.� The mother went to stay at her mother�s in
fear.� 

 

44����� On
19th April 2011 while staying at the grandmother�s the mother
received a series of threatening messages from SP (brother of F), F and a
friend of F�s � SP�s messages indicating that he would come to her door and �open
her up.�� Later in the evening of 19th April the mother again
called police as a result of a man climbing over her back fence.� She was
worried this was related to the text she had received.�� When cross-examined by
Miss Newton, whose client broadly accepted the police records, that she had not
seen whether the individual who came over the fence was the father or his
brother, she accepted that and she accepted that in fact that could well have
been a drugs-related episode.� 

 

45����� On
14th July 2012 the mother reported to police that she separated from
the father four weeks ago and that since then they had argued over contact.�
She was worried F and his brother might turn up at the family home as he
threatened to do so.� The mother had initially thought when she gave evidence
that her separation had been before this time but as she acknowledged it was an
on/off relationship she agreed it likely represented the truth.� 

 

46����� There
were police callouts in relation to other matters that did not directly relate
to F.� In October 2010 a relative of F�s and her partner turned up at the
family home demanding money from the mother, swore at her and threatened her,
but left when she called the police.� 

 

47����� In
October 2011 the mother returned home to find that the family home had been
broken into, paint had been thrown over the walls, sofas, armchairs, stairs and
bedroom doors upstairs; water had been turned on; the house was flooded; the
sofa was slashed.� The mother did not think that the father had caused this
damage; she thought it was related to drugs.� 

 

48����� On
23rd January 2012 the fence at the family home was ripped down and
three men tried to kick the door down.� This happened in the evening.� The
children were in the house.� The mother agreed they would have been aware of
this incident as it caused a lot of noise.� Again the mother told me this
incident might have been drug-related.� 

 

49����� In
February 2012 the mother was called by an unidentified person to say that he
was on his way around and would smash her skull in and cut her up.� The mother
was anxious that the individual who threatened her might have other family
members with him.� 

 

50����� On
12th March 2012 at 19:05 LD attended the mother�s address together
with his father and cousin.� According to the mother LD was angry.� He blamed
her for his arrest a few weeks beforehand.� He kicked the front door of the
family home, shouting �Fucking cunt!�� She told him to go away or she
would call the police whereupon he replied �I don�t care.� I�m going to come
back with a knife, break through your door and stab you up.�� 

 

51����� On
16th March 2011(sic) RL and the grandmother were at the
mother�s address when LD, his father and cousin came to her property again and
came into the house.� Her door was open as ML�s step-grandfather was cutting
her lawn.� They threatened ML.� 

 

52����� On
9th March 2012 at about 8:30 pm CL jumped out of a window and ran
away from home.� He was upset because he could not see his father.� He was
found by a member of the public at a local football ground, screaming out for
help, distressed and shaken up.� He reported that his mother was drunk and that
he had been sleepwalking.� The mother denied being drunk and it does appear
from the police record there is no record of any concerns being expressed on
CL�s return home of the mother being drunk.

 

53����� On
27th March 2012 at 18:35 mother called the police because she had an
argument with CL about ice cream which resulted in his going outside, getting a
metal bar from waste dumped by the side of the road and smashing up the garden
fence.� During this incident he called his neighbour a �Paki cunt.�� He
stopped and walked off in the direction of the church carrying the metal bar
and then returned to the fence.

 

54����� On
5th April 2012 CL lost his temper and smashed the front window in
the family home.� The window was double-glazed.� Once the outer panel was
smashed, CL continued to try and smash the inner window with rocks.� ML tried
to stop him but could not get near him because he was �lashing out.��
This incident continued from the time the mother called the police at 15:26
throughout the afternoon.� When the police first arrived CL appeared to calm
down but she had to call the police again because of an escalation in CL�s
behaviour after they left.� He came inside the house and tried even harder to
smash the window from the inside.� He assaulted his siblings by kicking and
punching them.� Police attended and spoke to CL and again he seemed to calm
down, but after they left the mother had to call the police for a third time at
19:34.� He was attempting to continue to smash the window by kicking at it
again.� He had written on the curtains and hit his sister around the head.�
Mother requested help as he was �going crazy.�� A further call was made
by the maternal grandmother who attended the family property at 20:02.� She was
worried because CL was smashing things and lashing out.� He was throwing things
at his mother whilst grandmother was on the telephone.� When both the mother
and grandmother gave evidence they agreed that only the maternal grandmother
had been able to calm CL down and that only happened when she required the
mother to leave the property.� The mother told me that on this day the other
children had been very distressed.� 

 

55����� On
29th October 2012 SP called F and stated he would come around and
smash his head in and smash his partner�s head in as a result of arguments over
the custody of MR and F stayed at the house all night before reporting that
incident the following day.

 

56����� On
30th October 2012 at 18:29 the mother called the police to report
that over the last few weeks she had received a number of nuisance calls and
texts from SP regarding the custody of MR and had received a call that day
which was threatening.� She was concerned for her safety because three men had
turned up at her door and were banging on it and shouting.� She could not see
who they were as they were wearing hoodies and had them up.

 

57����� On
24th June 2013 the mother called the police again to report that she
had been receiving threatening messages from SP but also from KP and
Christopher P.� There was a dispute between F and members of his family about
an ongoing criminal case.� She told me that because F had changed his telephone
number the messages were coming to her.� Subsequently she did not want any
further action to be taken as she told me she had received an apology from
those people.

 

58����� On
23rd July 2013 the mother had to call the police because CL was
smashing up the family home with a Hoover pipe.� She reported that there was
plaster everywhere and that when she tried to get close to him he tried to
attack her with the pipe.� During the call CL went to the top of the stairs and
urinated down them.� The other children were present during this incident and
were very scared and upset.

 

59����� On
25th July 2013 mother called the police and reported that SP had
again threatened her during a telephone conversation, saying that he would come
to the house and �light up Cheddar Avenue, break down your door, shoot you
between your eyes and make sure there are people watching when I do it.��
The records indicate that a day later whilst accepting that she had called the
police to complain about this she refused to pursue the complaint.� She told me
when she gave evidence that she had been just advised to leave it and not
proceed with a formal complaint as it was a threat made by telephone.� I did
not believe the mother.� I think this was an occasion when she decided not to
pursue her complaint.

 

60����� On
27th July 2013 the mother called the police because CL had wanted to
go outside and play and the mother had refused to allow him; he tried to climb
out of the window; damaged the hinge in so doing and ran off saying he was
going to Rayleigh.� He left the house with bare feet; he came back carrying two
large bits of plastic and was threatening people.� If anyone tried to approach
him he lashed out with the plastic.� The police attended and calmed him down
but after this incident CL�s behaviour deteriorated so that at 21:31 mother
again had to call the police.� CL was smashing at the worktop and threatening
LD, who was at the home, with a knife.� Mother described LD on this occasion to
police as her �friend.�� 

 

61����� On
30th July 2013 at 15:59 mother received texts from F�s family asking
her to give F his benefits money which was being paid into her account and
mother called the police alleging harassment.

 

62����� On
30th July at 21:43 the police had to attend the mother�s address
because of concerns that LL had taken by mistake or by accident a tablet for
ADHD and had also received a burn on her arm caused by one of her siblings but
the paramedics who attended were not concerned about LL�s presentation.

 

63����� On
31st July 2013 the mother called the police to allege that once
again she had been threatened by SP in numerous messages on her telephone.� He
demanded money from her; he had threatened to shoot her.� She was unwilling to
make a formal complaint but did agree that she should move from her property
and went to stay with her brother RL.

 

64����� These
historic incidents and complaints in addition to those which were agreed
between the parties in relation to threshold appeared to me to be important to
record in order to paint a fuller picture of the children�s experiences in the
care of their parents than might be understood from the agreed threshold
facts.� In my judgment the difficulties encountered by these parents affecting
their parenting of these children were diverse, very serious and chronic.� 

 

The
impact upon the children.

 

65          
The
impact of the parenting on each of the children has been significant.� CL has
been perceived within his family to be the problem child.� The guardian told me
that he was referred to as being �bad� consistently by most of his siblings,
and in her first statement the mother focuses on CL as a cause of a lot of the
family�s problems.� In her initial evidence she attributes this to diagnoses of
ADHD and/or ODD.� Having heard Dr Surgenor�s evidence the reality of course is
somewhat different.� Each of these children has been profoundly affected by
their experiences of family life in the care of the mother and from time to
time the father, but CL as the eldest child has been the one most obviously and
profoundly damaged by his experiences.� 

 

66          
Dr
Surgenor is a clinical psychologist who, as I have said, has undertaken a
comprehensive assessment.� There was little challenge to her findings when she
gave oral evidence about the impact on the children of the poor parenting that
the children had received.� There was some suggestion by the mother that CL and
SL might have been affected as a result of their early life experiences in her
care when she was grieving the death of her father.� Whilst accepting that this
may have impacted upon her emotional availability to her children at that time,
Dr Surgenor did not accept this as a likely primary cause� of the extreme
difficulties exhibited by both CL and SL.� Dr Surgenor�s opinion is that each of
the children suffered from significant attachment problems.� Her recommendation
at F186 is that none of the children should be placed together.� She
acknowledged that this was an unusual recommendation and it is one that she had
thought very long and hard about.� She said this: 

 

��������� �It
is my opinion that the children�s individual needs are so significant that they
will struggle to cope if placed together in any combination increasing the
likelihood of placement breakdown.�� 

 

��������� She
thought that all of the children required above average reparative parenting to
address their emotional and behavioural needs.� 

 

67����� CL
has been the most severely affected.� He presents with an insecure, anxious
ambivalent attachment style, generally observed in children who have received
intermittent, unpredictable and inconsistent responses from their primary
care-giver.� This is complicated by a diagnosis of global learning disability.�
He is likely to increase his provocative and attention-seeking behaviours if he
feels that the interests of others is withheld.� It appears for a long time his
distressed and disturbed behaviours were wrongly attributed to these wrong
diagnoses.� He was perceived as a child who had problems.� As RL told me, when
explaining why he had offered to care for CL, he thought that as the
difficulties in the family were created by CL if he took CL his sister might be
able to manage the other four children.� I am not blaming RL or the family for
this misunderstanding.� They misunderstood the cause of the problem because
they were not aware of the extent of the mother�s difficulties.� CL�s
behaviours were of course not attributable to a condition from which he
suffered; they were a direct result of the chaotic parenting which had been
provided by ML and F ; his exposure to high levels of parental and family
conflict, including violence and threats of violence; and his parents� failure
to protect him from this.� In short his behaviour is evidence of the
significant emotional harm which he has suffered.� Shifting the responsibility
onto CL in the way that the parents did represented a clear demonstration that
they were unable or unwilling to take responsibility for their failings as
parents.� This approach was adopted by other members of the family, except it would
seem his grandmother.� As I have said, treating CL in this way had the
additional effect of isolating and in effect scapegoating CL as the problem
child when in fact he was merely demonstrating the harm he had suffered.� 

 

68����� There
was a significant escalation in his behaviours in the year prior to his removal
from the family home.� During this period the children were exposed to a number
of violent incidents including LD�s assault on CL.� Following the mother�s
report to the police the family was visited by LD�s father and cousin, who
threatened the mother.� Despite this, the mother appears to have continued her
association with LD and it was during this period that CL appeared to display
some particularly disturbed behaviour which I observe in the circumstances is
hardly surprising.� I have not heard from LD within these proceedings and I
cannot therefore make conclusive findings with regard to the alleged assault.�
What I consider to be important about this episode is that in circumstances
where her son claimed to have been seriously assaulted by LD the mother�s
response was to ask LD, who denied it.� I appreciate that she did complain to
the police about the assault and by so doing she appears to acknowledge its
seriousness.� However, after this, once she had obtained the denial from LD,
she told me that she did not know who to believe and she continued to associate
with LD.� This must have been interpreted by CL as indicating that despite the
seriousness of his allegation his mother either did not believe him or was not
concerned as to whether or not the allegation was true.� The effect on his
sense of security and his self-esteem must have been enormous.� As the family
looked for solutions RL stepped forward and offered himself as a carer.� He
took CL to live with him at his accommodation.� Unfortunately, because of the
terms of his lease he was unable to have CL living with him full-time.� He told
me that he would only have been able to have him there 3-4 days per week.� CL
then returned to the mother�s care and RL told CL that he could live with him
as soon as he obtained permanent Council accommodation.� Despite this it would
appear that no steps were taken to arrange for CL to spend even the 3-4 days
per week with RL.� A couple of days after his return to ML�s CL became
extremely distressed and I have already dealt with the incident that occurred
on that occasion.� I agree with the local authority that this was no
coincidence.� He was distressed to have returned to his mother�s care and he
was demonstrating that distress by escalating his behaviour.� CL�s behaviours
became so extreme that the guardian had considered whether or not the court
should approve a plan for CL to be placed in residential care.� I declined to
take that step at the interim hearing when I was invited to consider it.� By
this time CL had an established pattern of absconding from foster care back to
his family and was saying openly that he wanted to live with his grandmother.�
I thought it was best to wait for the expert opinion of Dr Surgenor and it
seemed to me to be a risky strategy to place CL somewhere from where he would
abscond, potentially at a distance from his home with all of the attendant
risks to his emotional and physical safety when he absconded.� He moved of
course as I have already indicated into the care of his grandmother.� 

 

70����� SL
also presents with insecure, ambivalent, anxious attachment.� She displays
distressed behaviour including whining, attention-seeking, being provocative,
fractious, demanding in an attempt to increase her care-giver�s responses.� Her
presentation is complicated by her exposure to traumatic experiences which have
left her in a state of heightened arousal and high anxiety, according to Dr
Surgenor.� I accept that evidence.� She is however keen to be placed in the
care of her maternal grandmother.� Dr Surgenor acknowledges it will be
difficult for her to understand why she cannot be placed there when CL is.� Dr
Surgenor is worried that within that placement if both children are placed
together SL will try to compete with CL for the mother�s attention and in so
doing this may cause a placement into which CL has settled so well to be
threatened.� The guardian does not agree that this is necessarily the
consequence of trying out the placement.� When Dr Surgenor was challenged about
her opinion it became clear that her overriding concern was the stability of
CL�s placement.� She was worried it would be devastating for CL if that broke
down.� She did not express optimism about the options for him if that placement
did break down and was worried he would end up in a residential placement from
which he would likely abscond and that would just lead inevitably in due course
to potentially secure accommodation.� She accepted that grandmother would be
able to meet SL�s needs.� She was a good carer.� So if one examined the issue
of carer capability in isolation from consideration of CL�s needs there was no
issue.� It was about whether she could manage the competing needs of both
children.� 

 

71����� When
cross-examined she agreed that CL had feelings of responsibility towards his
siblings and would likely be distressed as a result of the outcome of the
proceedings if things did not go the way he hoped.� She agreed that he had
expressed a wish to live with SL.� She agreed that if it were not tried and SL
remained in long-term foster care CL would likely feel responsible.� She agreed
that this posed a threat to the stability of the placement regardless of the
court decision because this would be an outcome he continued to want to
achieve.� The guardian had told me that in discussions she had CL had been so
concerned about SL�s position that he had made the suggestion that he could go
into foster care instead in order to allow her to live with grandmother.� This
suggestion of CL�s paints a picture of a child with an acute sense of
responsibility � which I should add he does not have � for SL�s predicament.� 

 

72����� Looking
at SL, she wanted to live with CL and her nan.� Dr Surgenor agreed it might be
difficult for her to accept remaining in long-term foster care if placed
outside her family when she knew that CL enjoyed the love and affection of the
person she wanted to be placed with.� SL would know that her nan wanted her to
live with her as well, and she would know that there were no concerns about her
nan�s capabilities to care for CL.� Dr Surgenor agreed that all these factors
might then make it more difficult for SL to make the proper emotional
investment in a new carer.� When the guardian gave evidence she told me she disagreed
with Dr Surgenor.� She acknowledged the risks of destabilising CL but felt on
balance that this option needed to be tested because if it could work it would
obviously provide both children with an opportunity to grow up within their
family and with each other, which was preferable to only one of them having the
benefits of family life.� I prefer the guardian�s analysis.� Each of these
children wants to live with their nan.� I acknowledge when it is tested I
accept Dr Surgenor�s evidence there is a significant risk that it might not
work.� However, that will not be established unless it is tested.� This is not
a scenario where grandmother will simply be left to cope alone.� The interim
care plan proposed by the local authority will have to be underpinned by
continuing professional assessment and support.� If it is not tried, the
placement for CL will continue, but at what cost?� The aspirations of each of
the children is for a different outcome; the children�s presentations will not
remain static; they will both be profoundly disappointed by the outcome.� CL
will feel responsible for SL�s plight.� This may in any event threaten the
stability of his placement.� CL has shown himself to be an individual who will
escalate his behaviour when distressed in order to achieve the desired
outcome.� If this plan is not tried I think there will be a significant risk
this could happen.� 

 

73����� Similarly,
unless it is tried there is a significant risk that SL will never emotionally
invest in new carers.� In addition, her feelings of rivalry will be exacerbated
so that instead of improving the relationship between the siblings she will
likely feel increasingly bitter at the unfairness of the �bad� boy, i.e. CL,
being allowed to live with nan when she has to stay in foster care.� At some
point she might vote with her feet or engage in behaviours to end her placement
in the hope that she too can achieve the outcome she desires.� There had been
the tentative plan to test out the placement which was halted as a result of Dr
Surgenor�s preliminary findings.� SL may well have been aware of this possible
plan.� This is a large family; there is regular contact between the members of
the family and different children, some of whom attend the same school.� Even
if only one of those children became aware of the possibility of SL moving to
live with nan and CL, there would be a route for this information to find its
way back to SL.� How could SL or CL ever fully accept placement of her outside
her family if this option is not tested?� So whilst I agree with Dr Surgenor
about the significant risks of pursuing this plan I think the other risk
factors which she accepted and which I have outlined tip the scales in favour
of a cautious testing out of this placement.� 

 

74����� I
am entirely satisfied from all of the evidence that I have heard that CL has
settled extremely well into the placement with his grandmother.� His behaviour
is now improved; he has shown confidence; pride in his appearance; he is making
friends.� Everyone in this case agrees � and I agree � that it is vital that
his placement with his grandmother is supported and underpinned by the
grandmother having a final order in her favour.� I have considered of course
whether or not in light of the agreement between the parties the proportionate
response would be to allow the residence order to continue but I think that CL
needs the greater security afforded by special guardianship order.� He needs to
understand � as does the family � that this order which secures his placement
is final and that it is intended to be enduring.� In this complex family
situation he needs to be reassured that it is his grandmother who will have the
first and last word on what is best for him.� He wants to stay there; it would
be devastating for him if that placement broke down.� It would leave him
adrift; no family member able to resume his care; with the only realistic
option some form of residential placement.� Because of the chronic and profound
harm he has suffered, it is even more important for him to have that security,
the security of knowing he will not be removed from the home of his
grandmother, and for all of those reasons the best order to make in this case �
and the only order which will secure, in my judgment, CL�s welfare � is for me
to make a special guardianship order in favour of MGM and I do so.� 

 

75����� I
agree with the guardian, as I said, that the placement of SL with the
grandmother needs to be tried out.�� SL�s wishes and feelings have to be taken
into consideration and she wants to live there.� There is, as I have found, a
real risk she will reject any plan for foster care if it is implemented without
this trial having taken place.� Her parents cannot care for her; her
grandmother has the ability to provide a good level of care, and she would have
the opportunity to be with one of her siblings.� I have to think of course
about what is best for both children.� I have already identified significant
risks to CL if this is not tried; there are on the other side significant risks
if it is.� There are risks of course to SL, that she would never accept
placement elsewhere unless it is tried.� This is a situation which is very
delicately balanced and requires very careful management.� On any view this is
a plan which will require the local authority to share parental responsibility
for the duration of the transition and perhaps beyond.� I have in those
circumstances given very careful consideration to whether or not I should make
a final care order in favour of the local authority on the basis of this plan
as a final care plan.� But I have decided on a fine balance that it would be
best to allow the proceedings to continue for SL for a discrete period of time
to allow for the testing out of the placement under interim orders for the
following reasons.� If a final order is made now SL will lose the benefit of
her guardian.� I have been very impressed with and reassured by the analysis of
the guardian in this case.� She has been fair and balanced in her assessment
and has shown an ability to be flexible in her recommendation.� Secondly, if I
take that option the grandmother will lose the benefit of any representation
within these proceedings because of course the proceedings will come to a
conclusion.� So for those reasons on a fine balance I agree that the
proceedings for SL should be adjourned under an interim order.� I do not
propose to make directions in relation to that today because I want to give the
parties the opportunity to reflect on the judgment after I have given it, so I
propose to list the matter shortly after I return to work � I am not at work
next week � in order for directions to be given in relation to that
assessment.� 

 

76����� Moving
on now to AL, MKL and LL, in relation to the three youngest children I accept
Dr Surgenor�s evidence that those three children will likely exhibit high
levels of distress which would result in challenging and potentially violent or
destructive behaviours if they are placed together.� In my judgment they need
to be placed separately from each other.� Their presentations in foster care
support that opinion with regard to the diagnosis and placement together.� When
MKL was in foster care and placed with LL he was violent towards her and that
violence took an extreme form.� The guardian told me of an occasion when the
foster carer had crossed to the other side of the room; when she turned around
MKL was strangling LL.� As a result of that MKL was moved from the placement
with LL and into the same placement as AL.� What happened then was that almost
immediately AL, whose behaviour had been fine prior to MKL�s arrival, started
to demonstrate extreme and challenging behaviours.� Both AL and MKL have been
very challenging in their foster placement.� I have heard evidence that somehow
� and it is still unclear quite how they managed this because of the very small
gap between the top of the wardrobe and the ceiling � they have managed between
themselves when in their room to make two holes in the ceiling, and there was
another occasion when one of them lay underneath a bed and the other jumped on
top of it so vigorously that the bed slats were broken.� This was quite clearly
a potentially dangerous situation for the child lying underneath the bed.� A
further example was MKL being given a watch for Christmas but having broken it
by the next day.� 

 

77����� AL
and MKL � there is no family member who contends that either AL or MKL should
be placed within the family.�� The choice for these boys therefore and the
focus of a dispute between the parties is between whether it is best for them
to be placed in long-term foster care or adopted.� AL and MKL both have
insecure, ambivalent, anxious attachment styles.� AL has been extremely
demanding of attention, will escalate his behaviour until he obtains the
desired response; he can lash out and be violent, and in addition he has
significant learning needs.� MKL has an insecure, anxious attachment with
behaviour alternating between distressed behaviour, crying, fretting, whining
and attention-seeking to being withdrawn when he appears to be depressed.��
When giving evidence on the first day of the hearing Dr Surgenor told me that
the prospects of securing adoptive placements for these boys was �pretty
low� but this was in response to a question about the boys not being easy
to place.� When she returned to the witness box she revisited this issue and
said in response to a question about whether or not AL was adoptable: 

 

��������� �My
concern is� about whether AL is adoptable.�� I do not go so far with LL and
MKL.� LL�s behaviour is challenging but I see her as being adoptable.� MKL is
also an endearing child.� The extent of his difficulties are not as extreme as AL�s.�� He is a lot calmer and easier to manage one to one.� He is adoptable.�� 

 

��������� She
was not challenged in relation to that answer.� 

 

78����� On
the first occasion that the guardian went into the witness box she appeared to
agree with Dr Surgenor�s analysis in respect of AL.� She was worried not only
about the feasibility of securing adopters but about his age and the level of
his difficulties.� I thought she did not really think AL should or could be
adopted.� She had said in her report: 

 

��������� �I
have some apprehension about a placement order for AL on two grounds, firstly
being his age and the second is that the issue of his sexualised behaviour
needs further professional assessment.� It is also on the grounds that AL shared with me that he does not want new parents.� However, I do acknowledge that should
an adoptive family be available for AL this would provide him with a greater
degree of security.�� 

 

��������� It
was that view in part which had made her apprehensive about AL and MKL
remaining in the same placement whilst searches for adopters were undertaken.�
She thought MKL would move on first to such a placement leaving AL behind.� She was worried about the resultant impact on his self-esteem.�� 

 

79����� I
think there was a sound reason for her change in position on the last day of
evidence when she decided to support the local authority plan for placement
orders for AL.� Given the difficulties in securing an appropriate placement for
  AL it is perfectly understandable that both she and the professionals should
want the search to be widened as far as possible.� It is also understandable
that if he could have the chance of adoption and the potential greater security
that would offer, it may be better for him than being in long-term foster care
with the relative instability that option offers.� However, in my judgment her
analysis ignores the fact that both she (at least in her initial evidence) and
Dr Surgenor suggested that AL was presently unadoptable because of the extent
of his difficulties.� I accept that analysis.� AL is a boy aged eight.� He has
been ambivalent about having a new family and this no doubt reflects in part
that as an eight-year old he is already a fully-integrated member of his own
family with an established identity.� Like his siblings � because I accept Dr
Surgenor�s evidence on this point � he does not have a significant relationship
with either of his parents, although I note that he was very keen to and happy
to see F.� His parents accept that they should not look after him.� AL�s difficult behaviours undoubtedly reflect the emotional harm he suffered in his
parents� care.� He is currently displaying sexualised behaviour which the
guardian thought in her report needed to be assessed before he could be placed
for adoption.� He needs plans to be made for him without delay but any change
in his circumstances will be difficult for him as a result of his attachment
difficulties.� Such a move will have to be well-planned and should if possible
be his last move.� In the circumstances it is essential that the right carers
are identified for him.� 

 

80����� I
accept Dr Surgenor�s analysis and the guardian�s original analysis regarding AL.� I think he is not ready for adoption.� He is a child with significant emotional and
behavioural difficulties which require further assessment.� He has a learning
difficulty.� Even if adopters could be found who wanted to look after him,
would they have the right qualities?� Given the extent of his difficulties,
adopters � who may be relatively inexperienced � might not be equipped with the
skills to care for a child with AL�s level of needs.� If the wrong carers are
selected for AL his prospects of remaining in the same placement diminish.�
Irrespective of whether or not the placement is adoptive, this could lead to
placement breakdown.� It would be devastating for AL to be returned to care in
such a situation.� He would feel unloved and rejected, and this would compound
the emotional harm he had already suffered.�� Having considered the evidence
very carefully, I conclude that AL is not ready to be adopted.� On the evidence
before me I do not find that adoption can be said to be in AL�s best
interests.� However, in my judgment it is plainly in AL�s interests that the
local authority is able to share parental responsibility with AL and make plans
for his future placement in long-term foster care without delay.� This will
enable him to retain some limited contact with his birth family and it may be
that further consideration will need to be given to that particular issue.� I
make therefore a care order to the local authority but I refuse the local
authority application for a placement order in respect of AL.

 

81����� Moving
on to MKL, he has difficulties and he has not done so well at school as might
have been expected.� There have been doubts about whether or not the foster
placement he is in best promotes his welfare.� Firstly, he is placed with AL and for all the reasons put forward by Dr Surgenor these children cannot and should not
be placed together.� Secondly, he is with a single carer and the guardian
thinks he needs to be cared for in a family where there are two carers, one of
whom will be a male carer.� Dr Surgenor described MKL as a endearing little boy
and he did rest his head on the guardian�s lap at story time.� He is in need of
reparative parenting but he is in the view of Dr Surgenor and the guardian
adoptable.� Any work which needs to be undertaken with MKL is work which is in
my judgment preparatory work rather than work which would inform a decision as
to what the best plan is for him.� Adoption in my judgment undoubtedly offers
any child the best opportunity for stability and security because adopters make
a greater lifelong commitment to a child than foster carers.� Adoption is an
outcome which can only be contemplated where there is no other alternative and
where the court is satisfied having undertaken an assessment that this is the
option which best meets the child�s needs.� MKL cannot be cared for within his
family.� In my judgment, if it is possible to secure an adoptive placement for
him it will offer him the best prospect of security and stability.� It may take
time to find such a placement and it may ultimately not prove possible, which
is why the local authority is right to propose a parallel search for the right
carers.� If they are foster carers and they are prepared to make a long-term
commitment to MKL it will be much better for him to move into that placement
rather than await an adoptive family.� However, if there were two placements
available at the same time, one adoptive and one long-term foster placement, I
accept the guardian�s evidence that the better option for MKL would be an
adoptive placement.� 

 

82����� The
impact of adoption on MKL and the severing of his link to his family of origin
will unquestionably be lifelong and profound.� He was noted to have been
excited when he was told � mischievously by AL � that he might be going home.�
I do not find this surprising, but in the circumstances I cannot have regard to
that as an expression of his wishes and feelings to which I could attach any
real weight.� He is too young and he does not have sufficient understanding of
the options.� Even if he did want to go home, sadly that is not an option for
him.� He desperately needs carers of the sort the guardian has described who
can make a long-term lifelong commitment to him.� I have already accepted � and
no party argues � that his parents and family cannot care for him and accepted
that he cannot and should not be placed with his siblings.� He is destined
therefore for a solo path.� I accept Dr Surgenor�s evidence that his
relationship to his parents is not significant.� His relationships with his
siblings appear from the evidence I have seen to be relationships which
threaten MKL�s emotional stability and wellbeing rather than enhance and
support him.� Both of these factors lessen the long-term emotional impact of
adoption on MKL.� He will of course be unsettled and disturbed by any change in
his circumstances, as would any child be.� But a change involving a move into a
placement where he can be by himself with appropriate carers is likely to be in
my judgment a positive experience given the difficulties he encounters in his
present placement with AL.� Although quite understandably his family does not
want him to be adopted, I have reached the firm conclusion that this is the
only option which will meet his needs.� I am therefore going to make a care
order to the local authority for MKL enabling the local authority to share
parental responsibility with his parents and implement plans for his future
without delay.� 

 

83����� Having
decided that MKL�s welfare requires adoption, I move on to dispense with his
parents� consent and having already in any event in this long judgment
considered the matters to which I am directed in Section 1(4) Children Act I
make a placement order in respect of MKL to the local authority.

 

84����� LL.�
There is a conflict between the evidence of Dr Surgenor and Linda Sansom about
the nature of the relationship between LL and her mother.� Miss Sansom observed
positive interactions and was in any event worried about the unhelpful
interventions of the contact supervisor.� I am of course prepared to accept
that she is being truthful in what she observed and that she saw nice
interactions between mother and LL.� However as she herself acknowledged, she
is not an expert in attachment and she deferred to Dr Surgenor on this issue.�
Although Dr Surgenor only observed mother and LL together with all of her
siblings � and that was not a happy experience � she was confident in her
assessment.� I prefer Dr Surgenor�s opinion.� LL demonstrates an insecure
avoidant attachment style present in children whose parents are emotionally
unavailable.� Although LL presents as a child who makes minimal demands on her
carers, she is also highly independent; she is intelligent; she is stubborn and
feisty.� She is likely to follow her own agenda and be a challenge to parent,
and when challenged she presents challenging behaviour.� However, even if I
were wrong about that, what Linda Sansom observed was interactions between
mother and child but in a highly supported setting.� This mother has been able
to demonstrate within that setting that she has basic parenting skills and is
able to interact with her child well over a limited period of time.� This
explains why her own family, with whom she was in regular contact, did not
really grasp how serious her situation was and the extent to which her children
were being harmed.� However the history indicates that she was unable to do
this on a consistent basis.� Her own vulnerability to more forceful
personalities, whether F or LD, rendered her powerless and unable to protect
her children from chronic and serious harm.� 

 

85����� During
the first week of the hearing, and in particular after hearing the evidence of
Linda Sansom, I thought that the decision for LL would be finely balanced and I
was open to the possibility of a further assessment.� In the event it became
clear to me after hearing the mother�s evidence that my initial optimism was
misplaced.� Whilst acknowledging that the mother has taken important steps
towards changing her life, the responsibility she accepts appears to me to be
limited to accepting that she failed to be assertive in the face of
manipulations and abuses from others, whether it was F, LD or her mother
colluding in sending her back to F.� Although she has told me she accepts she
is responsible for the continuation of this abuse by failing to act, her
evidence � her oral evidence � and the attempts that she made within that
evidence to focus the responsibility with F almost exclusively indicate that
she does not really understand the extent of her own participation in this
serious and sustained emotional abuse of her children.� The most obvious
example of this was her assertion during cross-examination that LD had helped
her with CL.� I agree with the guardian that she has a long way to go.� She is
preoccupied, I think, with her own needs which appear to overwhelm her at
times.� It was for this reason that she formed the association with LD after
she separated from F.� There had been little mention of LD in the written
evidence and as I said she appeared to be thinking when she gave evidence for
the first time in the witness box about the harmful effect of that relationship
on her children.� Although she acknowledged responsibility for his abusive
behaviour towards her children and tried to reassure me, she then went on to try
to reassure me that because of his own experiences as somebody who had ADHD she
thought he understood CL and had been a generally helpful influence in the
house.� 

 

86����� I
have reached the clear conclusion that the mother in this case would not be
able to provide safe care for LL during her childhood and that the serious
risks to LL cannot be ameliorated or managed in a way that would enable the
mother to do so.� There are three principal areas of risk.� Firstly, the
mother�s attachments to men who pose a serious and ongoing risk of either
physical or emotional harm to both herself and her children and the mother�s
inability to protect her children from harm in this context.� Although she
professes to understand how her relationship with F could be harmful, she did
not demonstrate following her separation from F similar insight into the risks
posed by LD and she continued when giving evidence to me to justify his
presence in the house for reasons which do not bear scrutiny.� The context in
which I have assessed this risk is that she has been engaged with support in
relation to this issue for some time.� The bundle of additional documents she
provided during the course of this hearing included a letter from Basildon
Women�s Aid dated 22nd January which sets out a chronology of
support provided to the mother.� This chronology dates back to 2007 and it
includes the offers of refuge accommodation in 2011.� I accept of course Miss
Dooley�s submission that women who find themselves locked in an abusive
relationship require time to extricate themselves from those relationships and
time to develop insight into the circumstances which led them to both form
attachments and remain attached to men who abuse them.� However, in the context
of the findings I have made about the history this letter demonstrates that
with advice and support from Social Care over a period of years, the support of
a loving family, advice from organisations which exist to assist women in ML�s
predicament, her insight has been very slow to develop indeed and I endorse
what the guardian has said about it being very early days in her progress.� 

 

87����� Had
I thought that the mother showed, when giving evidence, that she appreciated
the extent of the historic risk and her own vulnerabilities to that risk, given
her willingness to undertake more work I might have felt more confident about
her proposal for further work.� However, at the conclusion of her evidence I
shared the guardian�s concerns about her lack of basic understanding of these
two issues.�� I felt when she gave evidence after the break in her evidence
about LD and professed to understand how that relationship had been damaging
that her evidence sounded rehearsed.� I thought she was saying what she knew
she had to say, and that is not a criticism of her; I understand that she wants
more than anything else to care for LL.� 

 

88����� Secondly,
there is a related risk which arises from this risk that I have already
described.�� The mother, as I found, has tended to develop attachments with men
who abuse her.� Apart from the direct risk that poses to her children it also
means that the mother, who is vulnerable anyway, becomes focused on her own
predicament and difficulties and is unable to meet in a sufficiently consistent
way her children�s emotional needs.� Frightened and vulnerable herself, she has
been and is unable to address their needs.� I think this is why her children
have � as I find they have � the attachment difficulties which Dr Surgenor
describes.� It is the reason why when describing the incidents of violence and
the threats of violence from LD or F when giving oral evidence she was not
really focused on the children�s experiences; it was her own experiences that
preoccupied her until she was asked to turn her mind to the children�s reaction.
�

 

89����� This
mother is not a person who is incapable of relating to her children but she has
been unable to do so consistently.� I am asked by Miss Dooley to consider that
the work on attachment which could be undertaken by the Munro Centre and which
could focus on improving the quality of childcare and interaction would be the
proportionate plan.� Were this the only risk there would be significant force
in what Miss Dooley says.� But it is not, as I have found, the only risk.� A
situation in which attachment can be improved will not protect these children
from the very serious risk of physical and emotional abuse to which they have
been subjected.� As I find that risk established, the risk and the harm which
flows from that risk outweighs any improvement which in my judgment could be
made in the attachment between LL and her mother.� 

 

90����� There
is a third area of risk.� It is linked to the risks which already have been
identified.� The mother lacks, I find, empathy for her children.� Her evidence
focused on her own experience and lacked the intuitive attunement to her
children�s experiences that is the essential ingredient of a reactive and
protective parent.� I have already referred to her appearing to think for the
first time in the witness box about the effect on CL of LD�s continued presence
in the home.� In the same way the blaming of CL for the family�s problems was a
convenient way to externalise the family�s difficulties and minimise her own
responsibility.� She may well have thought prior to Dr Surgenor�s report that
he had the diagnoses of ADHD and ODD but there appeared to have been no
reflection on whether or not the abuse he had witnessed had contributed to his
difficulties.� This lack of attunement is highly relevant to her prospective
capacity to care for LL.� LL appears sometimes to be a compliant child but she
is, as I have already observed, very bright, strong-minded and feisty.� She is
a child who wants to set her own agenda and who finds it difficult to accept
boundaries.� I was told that her foster carer had been shocked when LL, then
aged two, had sworn at her and told her to fuck off.� Historically this mother
has been unable to impose boundaries on her children.� I referred to her vain
attempts in pleading with CL to desist when he was engaged in trashing the
home.� I accept that work could be done with the mother on her ability to
manage boundaries but it is not simply about imposing boundaries in a formulaic
way.� It is about her lack of attunement to her children�s emotional needs
rendering her unable to adapt her responses and her parenting style as LL grows
and develops in a way that is sensitive to LL�s needs.� Dr Surgenor says that
LL will require carers who can provide her with care which helps address the
harm which she has already suffered.� She is likely to be challenging.� Dr
Surgenor says it can be �extremely difficult to impose boundaries as she
debates and argues with adults.� Without sufficient structure and containment
LL�s behaviour can rapidly deteriorate and she can become highly distressed and
agitated.�� I think that the mother�s difficulties with boundaries combined
with LL�s intelligent and independent character will mean that very quickly LL
will understand that she is the more powerful character within that
relationship and that mother is likely to relent if LL escalates her
behaviour.� To put it colloquially, I think that LL will run rings around her
mother, who will be unable to manage and contain her, to LL�s detriment.� 

 

91����� For
these three reasons, all of which are interlinked, I have come to the
conclusion after considerable deliberation that sadly in this case mother
cannot care for LL now or at any time in the future within a timescale which
will meet her needs.� I cannot therefore agree to an adjournment of the case
for LL in order to enable her mother to undertake further assessment because in
the context of the findings I have made I do not need that work in order to be
able to evaluate the best outcome for LL.� LL is a young child who has
experienced significant disruption and harm in the care of her mother.� There
is nobody within her family in my judgment who is able to provide her with a
long-term home.� She urgently requires placement which will provide for her
needs, not only during her childhood but throughout her life.� Any severance of
the link between LL and her birth family will cause her emotional harm.� There
have been some lovely and warm interactions between LL and her mother.�
However, as with MKL I accept Dr Surgenor�s evidence that her attachments to
her parents are not significant and that she requires in any event to be placed
separately from her siblings.� She is at an age where there has been no concern
expressed about the prospects of securing her an adoptive placement.� She is at
an age where she will be able, with appropriately skilled carers, to form and
develop attachments.� I agree with the local authority and the guardian that
the best option for LL will be within an adoptive family.� It would be harmful
for LL to remain placed outside her family in a foster placement for the rest
of her childhood, which by its very nature would not offer the degree of
commitment and prospective stability which an adoptive placement could offer
her.� 

 

92����� I
have had to consider the fact that LL has shown some evidence of sexualised
behaviour.� But the conclusion of the professionals is that it is an issue upon
which her carers will need to be given advice.� It may of course put some
prospective adopters off.� In any event advice has been given and work is being
undertaken with her carers on this particular issue.� It has not caused the
guardian, the social worker or Dr Surgenor to think that she is a child who is
not ready to be adopted.� She is quite obviously an attractive little character
and I am confident that it will be possible to secure an appropriate placement
for LL.� Therefore, having considered all of the options available to me, I
have come to the very clear conclusion that adoption is the only option which
will meet LL�s needs both during her childhood and throughout her life.� She
needs to move into her final placement urgently, not least because her current
carers appear to have struggled to manage her sexualised behaviour.� The
guardian thinks they may have made too much of this issue, the inference being
that this may have exacerbated the problem.� Given that she has already had two
periods of respite care with different carers, it will be important for her to
move into her long placement as soon as possible.� As Dr Surgenor says,
children with attachment difficulties do not react well to any change in their
circumstances.� 

 

93����� I
approve the contact plans in relation to all of these children which have in
any event been agreed between the parties.� Quite clearly in relation to LL the
local authority needs to share parental responsibility with her parents in
order to urgently implement the care plan and I make a care order in favour of
the local authority.� For all of the reasons which I have already rehearsed in
this very long judgment I have come to the conclusion that LL�s welfare needs
require her to be adopted and I therefore dispense with her parents� consent
and go on having considered the matters to which I am directed in Section 1(4)
Adoption and Children Act to make placement orders to the local authority.

 

94����� I
appreciate fully that the judgment I have given is long and that the parties
have been sitting in court for a long time.� I do not propose to deal with this
case any further today.� It does not seem to me that it would be the right
thing to do.� I am not here next week.� I propose to list the case for a
Directions hearing in order to consider the way forward.� I bear in mind in
particular that given the findings that I have made there may need to be some
discussion between the professionals about the placements for AL and MKL
because I have not made a placement order in relation to AL, and the plans that
were put before me were plans for adoption for both children and it was on that
basis that they were going to remain in their present placement.� So I want to
give the local authority, the guardian, and the family, an opportunity to think
about that further because it may be that they would wish to submit there
should be some tweaking to the plan.� I do not know; they may not; they may all
agree that the plans can stand as they are.� But in the context of the changes
that were made on the last day it seems important to give the parties that
opportunity.

HTML VERSION OF JUDGMENT
____________________

Crown Copyright ©





	I am concerned with EH born on 27.6.07, now 6y9m, the daughter of JH aged 43 and RS aged 47.  RS does not have parental responsibility for EH.

 

	EH has lived all her life with her mother and has continued to do so under Interim Supervision Orders that have been in place since 1.7.13 following proceedings under s31 Children Act 1989 being issued by Hertfordshire County Council.  EH is represented by her Children's Guardian Anne MacKenzie.  EH has a half sister D aged 18 who was removed from JH's care in 2005 and has since lived with the maternal grandmother MH.

 

	JH and RS are separated and have been so since 2011.  Before that date they lived together and shared the care of EH although their relationship ended some time in 2009.  EH has been having regular contact for the past year with her father on Wednesdays after school and overnight at weekends.  Prior to that she was seeing her father often but there was a less regular arrangement in place.

 

	The Local Authority brought these proceedings last June following a recurrence of difficulties that had led to JH's older daughter D being removed from her care under a care order in 2005.  The reasons that led to that removal can be summarised as follows: violent and volatile relationship with D's father Mr G, his mental health issues and drug misuse, JH's depression and alcohol misuse, and neglect of D's needs.  D was moved into foster care under a PPO in 2001 due to poor home conditions in combination with these concerns, but was returned and the child protection plan ceased later in 2001 due to improvements.  D was again removed in 2003 and returned in 2004 under a supervision order again due to improvements, but further deterioration in 2005 of her home conditions, poor school attendance and JH's difficulty accepting professional support led to D being placed with her maternal grandmother under a care order, where she remains.  She has a close and loving relationship with her mother JH.

 

	The difficulties leading to these proceedings are neatly covered by the agreed threshold document dated 25.11.13 found at A45a and cover the following strikingly similar issues: misuse of alcohol by JH when stressed, criminal offending to sustain that misuse, EH's awareness of the impact of alcohol misuse on her JH, the longstanding impact of depressive symptoms suffered by JH, poor and neglected home conditions, E's exposure to domestic conflict between her parents, unsatisfactory school attendance, JH's failure to engage fully and co-operatively with professionals.  Additionally cited in that document is Fathers confrontational and aggressive attitude to professionals, which the Father claims was due to the Social Worker's approach leading to an unsatisfactory working relationship.

 



	JH wants EH to remain in her care, and proposes a shared care arrangement with the Father, and the current contact arrangements with her father to continue.  She claims that her situation is vastly improved and that she can adequately meet EH's needs, so that EH's best interests lie in the least intervention in her life and in leaving her with JH.  She does not criticise Father's care of EH and promotes him as EH's alternative carer if not placed with her.

 

	RS had originally applied for a residence order in late 2012 as he was concerned that JH was not coping and wanted to care for EH if that proved necessary.  Those proceedings provoked a direction for a s37 report which was filed in March 2013.  That report was positive in its assessment of Father and recommended further assessment of JH.  His residence application was consolidated with the care proceedings issued by Hertfordshire County Council, and notwithstanding his earlier application RS repeatedly expressed a preference for EH being cared for by her mother if possible until comparatively recently in these proceedings, in about November 2013 when he sought an Independent Social Worker [ISW] assessment of his potential to care for his daughter; at which point he expressed the acknowledgement that EH's care should shift to him, with similar levels of contact to her mother as he is currently enjoying.  His position in regard to contact somewhat modified during the course of the evidence and he acknowledged that there should be some short period of settling in with more limited contact.

 

	Hertfordshire County Council's position was initially to decide that EH should be adopted, there being no family member identified save for the maternal uncle and aunt Mr and Mrs B who had been decided against in a viability assessment dated May 2013.  An ISW assessment of Mr and Mrs B was sought by the Guardian, and the Local Authority's position persisted until the receipt of a positive Special Guardian assessment of Mr and Mrs B.  Their current position is that EH should move from the care of her parents to the care of Mr and Mrs B as her Special Guardians.  Hertfordshire County Council proposes a greatly reduced programme of contact of only 6 occasions per year for EH with each parent and that it should, at least initially, be supervised.  Mr and Mrs B only wish to care for EH if neither of her parents are considered to be suitable and propose more generous monthly supervised contact for JH and fortnightly staying contact for Father.  (At the point of hearing the parties' submissions Hertfordshire County Council's position on contact had not been modified to reflect this.)  Hertfordshire County Council also seeks a 12 months Supervision Order, and this is agreed to by all the parties as appropriate whatever final order is made.

 

	EH's Guardian reported in October 2013 and shortly before this hearing.  She sought the further assessment of Mr and Mrs B in November 2013.  She has now concluded that EH should move to the care of her father and that a Supervision Order should be made.  She recommends an initial settling in period followed by regular weekly contact for Mrs H that should initially be supervised and can then progress, but not overnight contact at this stage.  I take this opportunity to thank the Guardian for her helpful efforts and careful insights in this case.

 



	I have read the documents filed in the core bundle and seen additional documents referred to me during the course of the hearing.  I have heard evidence from Ms Mayet the FAST assessor of RS, Ms McNab the social worker, Ms Bennet the ISW assessor of RS, each of the parents, Mr and Mrs B and the Guardian.  I have also read the position statements and read the Guardian's written submissions and I have heard the advocates' oral submissions to me during the course of the hearing. 

 



Summary of the legal framework

	This case is governed by the Children Act 1989.  The welfare of the children is paramount and no order should be made unless it is in the interests of the children.  In coming to my decisions in this case I have borne in mind the paramountcy principle, the no order principle and the need to avoid delay set out at s1 Children Act 1989.  

 



	I have applied the welfare checklist and considered those matters that the court must in particular have regard to:

 

(a)	the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding);

(b)	his physical, emotional and educational needs;

(c)	the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances;

(d)	his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant;

(e)	any harm which he has suffered or is at risk of suffering;

(f)	how capable each of his parents, and any other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting his needs;

(g)	the range of powers available to the court under this Act in the proceedings in question.



	Each family member's ECHR Article 8 rights to family life are engaged, and any intervention of the court must be to promote those rights, to balance competing rights, and in doing so to give appropriate precedence to the welfare of the children and ensure that any intervention is necessary and proportionate.

 



	I have borne in mind the principle that it is preferable, bearing in mind the children's needs, for them to be brought up within their own family.

 



	A further stipulation prior to granting any s31 order to the Local Authority is that I may not make supervision orders unless the threshold criteria are satisfied.  These have been conceded and agreed by the Mother (A45a in the bundle, dated 25.11.13), the Father having conceded the facts and the significant harm posed by the Mother's care but not that he harmed or posed a risk of significant harm to EH.  These concessions permit me to go on to consider whether care or supervision orders are in EH's interests.

 



	The standard of proof is the civil standard i.e. the simple balance of probabilities; and where I describe events or make findings, I have applied the balance of probabilities, the burden of proof being on the party seeking the finding.  In making any findings I have considered all the evidence and submissions, both oral and written, even if every potentially relevant factor may not be specifically cited.

 



	I also remind myself of the 'Lucas direction', namely that just because a witness lies about one thing, it does not mean that they are dishonest in all things.  Additionally, I bear in mind the recent guidance in Re S 2014, which makes the further point that non-disclosure or lying does not necessarily mean parenting or ability to co-operate is impaired:

 

"It has become de rigueur for a trial judge expressly to articulate their self direction in accordance with R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 in fact finding hearings. That is, the significance that may or may not attach to the lies told by a party in relation to the injury/behaviour in question. There is none such in this judgment which deals with outcome. A specific reference to the same is unnecessary but I do consider that it was unrealistic for the judge, and the professionals not to have appraised the same exercise in the context of the non disclosure and/or deceit in question. The fact of a parent's non disclosure or deceit is not necessarily determinative of parenting capacity or, depending on the circumstances, an ability to co-operate with the authorities."



	In light of the recent case law issuing from the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, I am reminded by counsel for the Local Authority in particular of the 'global', 'holistic' approach referred to in Re G 2013 and Re BS 2013 should lead me to look at the three realistic options before me equally and consider their pros and cons in terms of EH's welfare interests, the Local Authority's argument being that the Special Guardianship family placement with Mr and Mrs B has none of the problems presented by EH staying with either parent and should be favoured on that basis.  He accepted that if I find EH's parents to provide good enough parenting that I must consider retaining her upbringing with such a parent, but urged me to consider Mr and Mrs B as part of the analysis of the options the court must look at.

 

	I am urged by the parents and particularly on behalf of the Father to consider the primacy of the role of EH's parents in her life, the Article 8 rights that are engaged, and that if the Father is 'good enough' then that trumps an alternative family placement.

 

	The Guardian's advocate rightly reminds of the case of YC v UK (2012) which stated that family relationships should be preserved, families rebuilt and family ties only severed in exceptional circumstances, and that it is not enough to say that a child could have a more beneficial environment for their upbringing elsewhere.

 

	I remind myself of the binding authority of the Supreme Court in Re B 2013, and in particular the following passages:

 

"�67. I understand the concern which Lady Hale expresses in her judgment at paras 208-222, which in many respects reflect the very wise remarks made by Hedley J in Re L (Care: Threshold Criteria) [2007] 1 FLR 2050, 2063. Although they have been referred to by Lady Hale at paras 181-182 and Lord Wilson at para 27 and were set out in full by Black LJ in the Court of Appeal, [2012] EWCA Civ 1475, para 116, those remarks merit repetition, not least because they have resonance in relation to both main issues in this case:

"50. What about the court's approach, in the light of all that, to the issue of significant harm? In order to understand this concept and the range of harm that it's intended to encompass, it is right to begin with issues of policy. Basically it is the tradition of the UK, recognised in law, that children are best brought up within natural families. Lord Templeman, in In re KD (A Minor: Ward) (Termination of Access) [1988] 1 AC 806, 812, said this:

'The best person to bring up a child is the natural parent. It matters not whether the parent is wise or foolish, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, provided the child's moral and physical health are not in danger. Public authorities cannot improve on nature.'

� It follows inexorably from that, that society must be willing to tolerate very diverse standards of parenting, including the eccentric, the barely adequate and the inconsistent. It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting. In 	any event, it simply could not be done.

51. That is not, however, to say that the state has no role, as the 1989 Act fully demonstrates. Nevertheless, the 1989 Act, wide ranging though the court's and social services' powers may be, is to be operated in the context of the policy I have sought to describe. Its essence, in Part III of the 1989 Act, is the concept of working in partnership with families who have children in need. Only exceptionally should the state intervene with compulsive powers and then only when a court is satisfied that the significant harm criteria In section 31(2) is made out. �. It would be unwise to a degree to attempt an all embracing definition of significant harm. One never ceases to be surprised at the extent of complication and difficulty that human beings manage to introduce into family life. Significant harm is fact specific and must retain the breadth of meaning that human fallibility	may require of it. Moreover, the court recognises, as Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead pointed out in In re H [1996] AC 563 that the threshold may be comparatively low. However, it is clear that it must be something unusual; at least something more than the commonplace human failure or inadequacy.""

"�104.  We were not addressed on this Article or on those two cases. However, they all give added weight to the importance of emphasising the principle that adoption of a child against her parents' wishes should only be contemplated as a last resort � when all else fails. Although the child's interests in an adoption case are "paramount" (in the UK legislation and under article 21 of UNCRC), a court must never lose sight of the fact that those interests include being brought up by her natural family, ideally her natural parents, or at least one of them."

"�180. That thought has been followed through in numerous cases since. As Wall LJ pointed out in Re L (Children) (Care Proceedings: Significant Harm) [2006] EWCA Civ 1282, [2007] 1 FLR 1068, at 1084, "There are, of course, many statements in the law reports warning of the dangers of social engineering", citing in particular Butler-Sloss LJ in Re O (A Minor) (Custody: Adoption) [1992] 1 FLR 77, 79:

"If it were a choice of balancing the known defects of every parent with some added problems that this father has, against idealised perfect adopters, in a very large number of cases, children would immediately move out of the family circle and towards adopters. That would be social engineering . . ."

�181.  Re L is an important case because it concerned parents with learning difficulties, very considerable in the case of the mother. The judge had found significant harm on the basis of the report of a psychologist who had not been asked to assess this. She had acknowledged that there was no obvious harm, no explicit malicious abuse or extreme abuse: "On the contrary my concern in this family relates to the more subtle and ambiguous consequences on the children flowing from parental deficiencies". Wilson LJ commented: "So which was it? 'Significant harm' or 'subtle and ambiguous consequences'? Speaking for myself, I regard the two concepts as mutually exclusive" (para 31). For these and many other concerns about the report, the case was sent back to be re-heard in the High Court. In Re L (Care: Threshold Criteria) [2007] 1 FLR 2050, at 2063, Hedley J, having quoted Lord Templeman, continued (para 50):

"It follows inexorably from that, that society must be willing to tolerate very diverse standards of parenting, including the eccentric, the barely adequate and the inconsistent. It follows too that children will inevitably have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences flowing from it. It means that some children will experience disadvantage and harm, while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional stability. These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not the provenance [semble: province] of the state to spare children all the consequences of defective parenting."



	I also remind myself of Re BS 2013 decided in the Court of Appeal and I am assisted in particular by these key passages from Munby P's judgment:

 

"�18. We start with Article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There is no need for us to go through the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. The relevant passages from three key decisions, K and T v Finland (2001) 36 EHRR 18, R and H v United Kingdom (2012) 54 EHRR 2, [2011] 2 FLR 1236,[1] and YC v United Kingdom (2012) 55 EHRR 967, are set out by the Supreme Court in In re B (A Child) (Care Proceedings: Threshold Criteria) [2013] UKSC 33, [2013] 1 WLR 1911. The overarching principle remains as explained by Hale LJ, as she	then was, in Re C and B [2001] 1 FLR 611, para 34:

"Intervention in the family may be appropriate, but the aim should be to reunite the family when the circumstances enable that, and the effort should be devoted towards that end. Cutting off all contact and the relationship between the child or children and their family is only justified by the overriding necessity of the interests of the child."

To this we need only add what the Strasbourg court said in YC v United Kingdom (2012) 55 EHRR 33, para 134:

"family ties may only be severed in very exceptional circumstances and � everything must be done to preserve personal relations and, where appropriate, to 'rebuild' the family. It is not enough to show that a child could be placed in a more beneficial environment for his upbringing.""

"�23.  Behind all this there lies the well-established principle, derived from s 1(5) of the 1989 Act, read in conjunction with s 1(3)(g), and now similarly embodied in s 1(6) of the 2002 Act, that the court should adopt the 'least interventionist' approach. As Hale J, as she then was, said in Re O (Care or Supervision Order) [1996] 2 FLR 755, 760: "the court should begin with a preference for the less interventionist rather than the more interventionist approach. This should be considered to be in the better interests of the children � unless there are cogent reasons to the contrary.""



	I also note from this case, Munby P's firm comments at �28-29 regarding the necessary consideration of what support should be provided to enable a parent to meet their child's needs and that local authorities must then take steps to ensure that they do what is necessary to make the court's orders work.

 

	It is in paragraphs 43-44 that Munby P re-emphasises the observations of MacFarlane LJ in Re G 2013 that there should be 'global', 'holistic' evaluations of all the options rather than a linear approach that sequentially rules out parents leaving only alternative permanent placement options.  The emphasis of such an approach is to meet the paramount duty by this method of divining which option best meets the child's welfare.  Notably in �45 he returns to the emphasis in the Supreme Court's decision in Re B 2013 upon the importance of proportionality.

 

	While these cases are concerned with the 'last resort' of permanent removal of a child from a family by adoption, in this case I am being asked by the Local Authority to consider removing a child from both her parents to an alternative permanent placement with low levels of contact, albeit under a Special Guardianship Order and to extended family members. This is a marked intervention in terms of removing a child from the care of both her parents and limiting their relationships with each other.  The same principles will therefore apply while taking into account the less drastic features of the latter by comparison with adoption.  I derive from these authorities that the child's interests are of course paramount, and I must look at all the options for EH and how her needs will be met with an holistic rather than a linear approach, bearing in mind that one of her welfare interests is to be brought up within her family, and also considering that if either of her parents are good enough carers for her bearing in mind her particular needs then it is not a question of ignoring that in favour of some "better" placement.  That would be a disproportionate intervention amounting to social engineering and would fundamentally undermine her and their Article 8 rights for a child to be brought up within their family by their parents, albeit where they may show imperfections.  

 



HISTORY

	Most of the salient parts of the history of this case are not contested, and I deal with relevant disputed facts in the course of my analysis.

 

	EH's mother suffered an abusive childhood and has additionally been scarred by the death of a former boyfriend as a young adult.  She has suffered from both depression and alcohol misuse over many years, leading her to neglect the care of her oldest daughter D and resulting in D being removed from her care at the age of 9 as described above.

 

	EH's father has a less troubled background, albeit his father left the family when he was 12 and he was brought up by his mother.  He is currently sharing a flat with a friend.  He is self-employed as a parking inspector, issuing tickets to improperly parked cars on private parking sites.

 

	The parents' relationship began in 2006, EH was born in 2007, and the relationship continued until 2009 although Father remained living with Mother and EH until 2011 when the Father states that he became fed up with the state of the home and his poor relationship at that time with Mother and felt he had to leave, nonetheless leaving EH to continue living in those conditions from the age of 4 to date.  He visited regularly, and in particular for a 2 year period after he left he travelled 5 miles either by car or on foot every morning in order to ensure that EH was up, dressed, had breakfast and got to school.  This was due to his concerns that otherwise Mother would fail to meet those needs.

 

	Referrals were received in 2009 and 2010 that Mother was again drinking too much and an initial assessment was undertaken by Hertfordshire County Council but no concerns were noted.  But in 2012 the police referred the case to Hertfordshire County Council due to various incidents when Mother had shoplifted wine and food, and the police had noted the home to be in a poor condition.

 

	Hertfordshire County Council issued care proceedings in June 2013 notwithstanding a positive assessment of Father in the s37 report of March 2013, and subsequent to a significant downturn in the relationships between the Social Worker and the parents (and the Father in particular) due to a crisis in March 2013.  D was hospitalised with an episode of mental illness leading to an increase in Mother's drinking and a consequent decline in EH's care.  Father was contacted at short notice to have EH for a longer visit over a weekend and into the start of the following week.  Father was initially resistant due to his existing work commitments, but changed them to fit with the request.  However he was not properly informed about the extension into the following week and felt that he was being ordered about rather than being informed and asked in a sensitive and appropriate manner.  He was able to comply with the request, but clearly voiced his dissatisfaction to the Social Worker and her manager at the time in such a way that his response was considered to be 'angry and confrontational'. 

 



	The agreed threshold document reads as follows, with references to page numbers in the bundle:

 

"• There are longstanding concerns about the mother's misuse of alcohol.  

(a)	The Local Authority has received referrals in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2012 expressing concerns about Mother's drinking [C4].  

(b)	Mother has convictions for shoplifting which have included stealing champagne, vodka and wine [C5].  Mother has been involved in a recent shoplifting incident.  

(c)	Mother has admitted drinking excessively and said she primarily turns to alcohol when she is stressed and under pressure [C6].  Mother says she has significantly reduced her alcohol consumption.

(d)	Mother was drinking excessively in March 2013 when D was in hospital.  

(e)	On 18.03.13, during a home visit a large clear bin bag full of empty alcohol bottles was observed in EH's wardrobe [C6].  

(f)	EH has said that Mother 'gets poorly when she drinks too much' and during these times Mother cannot look after her, leaving EH to take care of herself [C12]

• There are longstanding concerns about Mother's mental health in particular depression: 

(g)	Mother has reported for many years that she feels depressed and stated that as a child she suffered physical and sexual abuse from her father and step-father.  Mother also witnessed domestic violence and her father was alcohol dependent [C8].  

(h)	Mother has been prescribed anti-depressants which she takes regularly [C9].  

(i)	Mother was seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Pasternak, on 25.04.13, and explained that she had been struggling with depressive symptoms for about 16-17 years and these symptoms were complicated with harmful alcohol use.  On 15.05.13, Dr Pasternak confirmed that Mother's main diagnosis would be one of a 'mental and behavioural disorder due to the use of alcohol' as well as 'depressive episode'. [C10].  Mother does not accept this

• The home conditions have been observed to be poor at times and have been described as dirty, cluttered and cold [C36].  Mother has been unable to sustain them to a good enough level:

(j)	On several occasions during home visits conditions have been observed to be in poor state such as on 26.07.12, 20.08.12, 29.08.12, 30.08.12, 01.10.12, 17.10.12, 02.11.12, 23.11.12, 29.11.12, 14.03.13, 09.04.13, 08.05.13 [Chrono, C13-C15].  Mother accepts that the home conditions were poor at times but that she has been able to maintain her home to a good standard

(k)	EH has stated that the house is sometimes dirty and smelly [C13]

• EH has witnessed domestic violence between her parents of a verbal and physical nature when they lived together and she has also witnessed acrimony between them post separation [C15]:

(l)	The police attended Mother's address on at least 2 occasions on 10.10.09 and 14.08.10 [C16].  On both occasions Mother was described as being under the influence of alcohol and Father was abusive in front of EH during the later incident.  Father has admitted to causing holes in most of the interior doors of the property, stating that he did this in frustration and that it is better for him to punch or kick the doors than to physically hurt Mother [C16]. Mother agrees that there has been domestic violence between her and Father and the police have been called.  Father agrees but contends these matters are of a historical nature.

(m)	On 28.01.13, Mother told her Recovery Worker, Jane McGuane, that Father had spat at her two weeks previously.  The Social Worker discussed this with Father on 30.01.13 who admitted to doing so and added 'if she'd have been a man, I'd have knocked her straight out' [C18].  Mother agrees this incident.  Father also agrees this incident and regrets it.  Father says the incident arose from circumstances whereby Mother had inflicted physical and verbal abuse directed at him.

• EH's attendance at school has been unsatisfactory and, despite Mother living less than a 5 minute walk away from school, Father was travelling from Harrow to take her to school.  Prior to the Initial Child Protection Case Conference on 09.10.12, EH's school attendance was 85.3% [C5].  Mother accepts that EH's school attendance has not been satisfactory in the past but says it has significantly improved.

• The parents have failed to engage and co-operate with professionals:

(n)	Mother failed to respond to several home visits from August 2012 to April 2013 [Chrono, C13].  Mother agrees but says her cooperation has improved.

(o)	To support Mother with her alcohol dependency, the Local Authority made a referral to the Crime Reduction Initiative on 17.10.12.  The Local Authority had to repeatedly ask Mother to engage with this service before she finally attended an initial appointment on 22.11.12.  Mother did return for a follow up appointment until 13.12.12.  Mother then cancelled two full assessment appointments on 20.12.12 and 09.01.13.  Mother has subsequently attended only 5 out of 10 key work sessions [C6]

(p)	Mother self-referred for counselling through Herts Mind Network but attended only 2 sessions, on 04.12.12 and 11.12.12, out of 10.  On 05.02.13, the Local Authority was advised that due to Mother's lack of engagement, she would be no longer offered counselling.

(q)	On 12.03.13, Mother's GP referred her for counselling and she was later offered psychotherapy but on 01.05.13, the therapist closed the case because Mother had not responded to any of the attempts at contact she had made [C11].  Mother does not accept this.

(r)	Father was angry and confrontational towards the Social Worker and Practice Manager during a telephone conversation to discuss EH staying with him over the weekend of 16.03.13 [C21].  Father agrees but does not consider that the Social Worker has acted in a constructive manner with the parents arising from which there is an unsatisfactory working relationship.

(s)	Father was also verbally aggressive and intimidating towards the Social Worker during a Core Group Meeting on 18.03.13 calling her a 'Nazi' [C22].  Father agrees but does not consider that the Social Worker has acted in a constructive manner with the parents arising from which there is an unsatisfactory working relationship.

• There are longstanding concerns about Mother's inability to meet the needs of both her children.  Mother's oldest child, D, has been subject to Child Protection Plans, a Supervision Order and finally a Care Order and currently lives with her maternal grandmother.  EH has also been subject to Child Protection Plans and the Local Authority has now had to issue Care proceedings in relation to her."

	The Mother was assessed by consultant psychiatrist Dr McClintock in July 2013 (E65), Father was assessed by Ms Mayet at FAST (a Hertfordshire County Council family assessment team) in early September (E84) with an addendum in October (E109), and ISW assessments of Mr and Mrs B (Special Guardianship report E157) and of Father (E222) were directed in November 2013.  Mother's application for an ISW assessment was dismissed.  

 

	Also dismissed by both HHJ Serota at the last directions hearing in February and by myself on the first day of this hearing was an application by the Mother to adjourn this hearing in order that she could be reassessed by Dr McClintock and that he should answer further questions.  I noted that he had declined simply to write his answers to a set of questions sent to him on 27.2.14, stating that an assessment appointment was necessary given the passage of time, and would not fit within the timescales leading to this hearing.  I noted that he also declined to answer two of the questions as they were matters of fact to be answered by the Mother.  I considered that the further information sought was not necessary given the Mother's case is that she is no longer drinking and given the cautiously optimistic conclusions of his July report, and in the context where the Local Authority bases its case upon the ongoing signs of neglect rather evidence of ongoing alcohol misuse or active/untreated symptoms of mental ill-health.  There would also be unacceptable delay to these proceedings with consequent impact upon EH.  In all the circumstances of the case and bearing in mind the overriding objective it was not proportionate to derail this final hearing for this purpose.

 

	Having heard all the evidence and submissions I gave a very brief decision with outline reasons late on Friday 14.3.14 and adjourned to 19.3.14 to give my full judgment, in order that EH could move straight from her after-school club with the least disruption.

 



EH'S WISHES & FEELINGS 

	As might be expected, EH has expressed the wish to remain living with her mother.  This is unsurprising given her age and that she has been cared for by her mother throughout her life.  More recently she has expressed ambivalence, telling the Guardian that she would like to live with mum then adding "or dad"; and she has also been noted to say last summer that she would like to live in a 'clean and sparkly' house, contrasting her current living conditions with those of a friend's home and her father's flat.  

 

	I have no doubt that she loves both her parents dearly and she has also emphasised that she would like them to get along well together.  She has said she does not want them to shout at each other.  She said this in June 2013 to the Guardian and more recently to the Social Worker.  

 

	I note that it was her request that led to her father being invited to spend Christmas Day together with her and her Mother at her home.  I have no doubt that she would like to spend significant time with both of her parents.  

 

	Although she has not stated this, I am sure that she would prefer to live with one of her parents than to have to experience the loss and disruption of moving to Mr and Mrs B's care.

 

	And if she could express it, I also have no doubt that she would like to experience consistent stable care where all her physical, educational and emotional needs were met and that she would wish not to feel scared, worried or lonely while being cared for.

 



EH'S NEEDS AND CHARACTERISTICS

	EH is a 6year 9month old white british girl.  She has all the usual needs for love, care, attention, support, education and stability of any young child.  

 

	She has experienced her mother's misuse of alcohol and neglect of some of her basic needs.  She has witnessed her parents shouting at each other in arguments and occasionally behaving violently towards each other.  As a result she needs to feel reassured both about her mother's well-being and to be particularly protected from any further exposure to the effects of any further drinking by her mother, and also any conflict between her parents.

 

	She has a speech and language processing difficulty which is being addressed at W primary school.  She is performing below average such that the school have considered that she would benefit from extra tuition in core skills which they also provide.  Accordingly she has an enhanced need for regular and well-supported schooling.

 

	She is much loved by both her parents and has a strong emotional attachment to both parents, such that she needs to continue to enjoy and benefit from those loving relationships.  This element is singularly lacking from the relevant sections of the Local Authority's evidence and the Social Workers statement.  I deal with this further elsewhere in this judgment.

 

	She is said by the local authority witnesses to be variously quiet, timid, shy, submissive; by others, notably the Guardian and ISW and Mr and Mrs B, to be playful, chatty, and to have an affectionate bond with both parents and particularly with her Father.  I will discuss this further under the heading of harm, but I find (as reasoned below) that her alleged quietness or submissiveness is atypical and that she does not suffer from a disordered attachment pattern, but has an affectionate relationship with her parents, and has shown otherwise normal behaviour with some degree of resilience and awareness of her experiences.  Consequently, I consider it is unlikely that EH is in need of the specialist services for children with disturbed behaviour at the Datchworth Project, nor is she likely to need or qualify for CAMHS input.  Those services are nonetheless available.

 



HARM EH HAS SUFFERED OR IS AT RISK OF SUFFERING

	EH has clearly been exposed to her parents' volatile loud abusive arguments, and more historically, a few incidents of violence between them.  In particular, in addition to the matters set out in the threshold document, the parents conceded that on one occasion when EH was very small her Mother had tried to attack her Father with a knife while he was holding EH, and on another occasion her Mother had thrown an ironing board at the Father who was lying in bed albeit they claim that EH was in her own bed and did not directly witness it as she was asleep.  Both parents also acknowledged that more recently EH has tried to intervene when they have been shouting at each other to ask them to stop and has put her hands over her ears.  She has told both the Social Worker and the Guardian that she does not like it when her parents shout and argue.  I find that both parents have been equally responsible for an unacceptable level of conflict between them which they were well aware that EH was witnessing, and that this has been at the very least extremely upsetting and destabilising for EH.  There is a likelihood that this has caused a degree of emotional harm to EH, but due to her fairly resilient presentation and fond relationships with both parents it is not clear to what extent this might be.  I note that since October 2013 the parents have been getting on better, and indeed it was very evident to me the level of support and co-operation they were offering each other at this hearing from their respective behaviour, evidence and positions.  On that basis, I consider that EH is at a much-reduced risk of suffering further harm from this type of behaviour between her parents.  However, it is possible that her Mother may resent EH moving to her Father's care which has the potential to lead to conflict in the future.  Given that these parents have been used to loud and abusive arguments to express themselves this may recur in those circumstances, but I am reassured by the work done by the Father at Caring Dads and by the future oversight of the local authority pursuant to an agreed supervision order to guide and assist the family in those circumstances.  

 

	Related to this issue, EH has told the Guardian of hearing her Mother argue with her recent boyfriend Mr C on the telephone.  For the avoidance of doubt, I have no hesitation in finding that EH said this and was not confused about what she heard, having met Mr C in the context of his being her Mother's boyfriend.  In the context of the incident of 27.1.14 when the police were called at 3.30am by a neighbour due to the extent of the arguments being overheard between Mother and Mr C, which also involved Mother throwing some of Mr C's property, I find that there has existed a recent risk of exposure to further domestic violence in her Mother's care.  I take into account that the Mother says this was an argument flowing from her attempt to bring the relationship to an end, and that both parents say that EH was staying with her Father that night (although it was a Monday and the police document at J77 says she was seen at home but had not witnessed the incident), but it is clear that Mother has permitted EH to overhear volatile conversations and that at the least the relationship has the capacity to be loud and conflictual.  Mother told me that he moved in for some 6 weeks since New Year and she ended the relationship on 15.2.14, but continues to see Mr C from time to time as a friend, and occasionally does his washing.  I note that it was Mr C's property that was cluttering the house and EH's bedroom as recently as 3.2.14 and that it has been with Mr C's help that Mother has made very recent efforts to clear, clean and start to redecorate parts of the house as noted by the Guardian on 19.2.14, and that Mother gave the Guardian the clear impression that this work was being undertaken with her current boyfriend (E254).  I also note that Mother concealed the existence of this relationship from the Local Authority until the incident in January brought it to their attention.  In these circumstances I find that the current and future status of Mother's relationship with Mr C is unclear.  In addition, I found the Mother's account of when and whether she knew that Mr C had criminal convictions unconvincing.  She gave different accounts in her oral evidence.  Firstly she claimed that she only became aware he had convictions this year, but later in her evidence she said she had known he had had a couple of fights long ago due to her general knowledge of his background having known him for some considerable time.  She acknowledged she first had a short intimate relationship with him last Spring and had refused to give his details to the Social Worker at that time for a police check, giving the reason that it was her 'private life'.  I find that she was to some extent aware that he had criminal convictions involving physical violence at the point last year that he first became her boyfriend, and that she failed to show insight or consider the implications and increased risk to herself and EH then or more recently, but chose to conceal his identity and her knowledge.  As a result I consider that based on this history, sadly, that the risk of exposure of EH to domestic violence in her Mother's care has to be considered an ongoing one.

 

	EH's Father is not completely exonerated here.  He was aware that Mother was seeing Mr C, but was not concerned to know more about him in order to protect EH.  He did not take issue with Mother that she had not openly discussed this with him, as he has done by raising with her the question of bringing EH into contact with his girlfriend.  He praised Mr C's help with improving Mother's home.  He did not fully understand the implications of the incident of 27.1.14 in terms of the risk to EH, and he has consistently downplayed the impact on EH of what she had witnessed occurring between her parents.  I therefore find that he is not yet fully attuned to risks associated with domestic violence and exposure to arguments, and more specifically that he was unable to see the concerns in terms of EH's exposure to Mother's relationship with Mr C.

 

	EH has also witnessed her Mother's misuse of alcohol and its effects, and has commented that her Mother is "poorly" when she has been drinking.  This is an accurate description from a child's point of view of exactly the effects of too much alcohol: her Mother shows signs of illness, and she is aware that it is because of the drinking.  This is bound to bring with it real worry for EH, plus seeing someone using an inappropriate method of dealing with stress, and obvious implications of not being looked after by a capable adult on those occasions when her Mother was 'poorly'.  These are harmful experiences.

 

	This will also have been in conjunction with her needs being neglected from time to time due to Mother's difficulties managing with the pressures of everyday life, whether this has been due to her depression, or her preoccupation with the distressing experiences of her childhood, or the effects of misuse of alcohol.  This has included: living in a cold, smelly, dirty, cluttered and inhospitable home; having to care for herself from time to time; not being assisted to get up and ready for school on time and poor school attendance; and inevitable lack of stimulation and supervision. This will have had the harmful impact of leaving EH unsure about whether her Mother will meet her needs, with consequent feelings of anxiety; missing out on being supported in her schooling and everyday practical needs, resulting in lower performance at school; and feeling uncared for, all of which have implications for her feelings of self worth.

 

	The Local Authority have also cited in support of their position EH's submissive behaviour, indicative they say of a damaged child. This was particularly noted by Ms Mayet, the FAST assessor, who ascribed it to her Father's authoritarian parenting style which she described during the observed contact visit in early September 2013, and she went on to speculate that EH must therefore suffer from an insecure attachment.  This analysis was adopted in the Social Worker's statements without further analysis.  

 

	She is sometimes noted to be quiet at school and prefers to talk to peers than adults.  However, I note that other professionals such as Ms Bennett ISW and the Guardian have observed EH to be playful, relaxed and chatty with her father.  In addition, the Social Worker notes in her final statement that EH's quietness may well have been due to fear and anxiety in the presence of professionals due to having been told by her mother that she was at risk of going into foster care (C154).  This would have fairly recently predated the FAST assessment.  Unsatisfactorily and somewhat unfairly, the Social Worker failed to incorporate this into her adoption of Ms Mayet's conclusions (C156).  The Social Worker also conceded, after being requested to consider the various options, that it was not possible to tell if EH's quietness or alleged 'submissiveness' and 'insecure attachment' might be due to having suffered neglect at home, experienced her mother's drinking, witnessing the occasional violence and conflict between her parents, as well as experiencing her father as being resistant, angry and 'authoritarian' at the FAST contact while being in a strange environment for that assessment, plus having been told recently by her mother that she may be going into foster care.  I was also disappointed that the Social Worker failed in her written and oral evidence to include or explain her own positive analysis and observations of the relationship between the Father and EH set out in the s37 report (E21).

 

	Ms Mayet is a qualified Social Worker and has a degree in psychology, and as such admitted at E94 that she is not qualified to diagnose attachment disorders, but nonetheless proceeded to do so and to rely on those conclusions.  However Ms Mayet was unable, despite being asked to consider the alternative observations of EH's behaviour by the ISW and Guardian, to incorporate this into her thinking, repeatedly emphasising that she "felt strongly" that this was the correct analysis of EH's relationship and the father's personality and its effect on EH.  This betrayed firstly a reliance on her own emotional response rather than an exercise in objective analysis.  It also demonstrated an excessively rigid and limited approach that applied the most negative interpretation to EH's and her father's behaviour, showing a lack of an ability to think more widely about either EH's wider experiences than simply those observed at FAST or the implications of others' observations. This was unhelpful and has led me to doubt the validity of Ms Mayet's conclusions from her observations. 

 

	The Guardian has observed EH on many occasions and in the company of both her parents and on her own.  It is clear that EH is comfortable with her Guardian and feels able to tell her a certain amount of her thinking.  The Guardian strikingly told me that the description of EH in the FAST report was quite unlike the little girl she is familiar with, and she gives her own observations of EH laughing and playing with her Father and telling him what to do (E128).  These were very much in keeping with those set out in the ISW's report, and subsequently described by Mr and Mrs B, of a child with a warm, natural and affectionate demeanour, who was expressive and chatty when feeling confident in those present, and showing no sign of fear, anxiety or disturbed attachment.  She also pointed out that no preparation of EH had been done in relation to the FAST assessment, and that this meant EH would have found it all very strange and that this may well have affected her presentation.

 

	Ms Bennett the ISW who assessed the Father, is a highly experienced Social Worker of some 30 years experience who has worked as a Guardian and ISW over many years.  Her observations of EH were undertaken on two occasions, rather than packed into a single visit; and she saw EH both after school and at the weekend, undertaking normal activities with her Father.  Her descriptions were entirely at odds with those of Ms Mayet and I had no reason to doubt that she had witnessed what she described.  It was suggested by Ms Mayet and the Social Worker that the Father might have 'learnt' what to say and so to portray an artificially enhanced relationship with his daughter.  Ms Bennett gave cogent and persuasive evidence about how hard if not impossible it is to coach a 6 year old to be happy/playful/chatty/affectionate if in fact they are fearful of and ill at ease with a parent.  She confirmed that it is far easier to achieve the reverse and encourage a child to be quiet and uncommunicative.  While I accept that he may have quite properly learnt that he needed to engage in a friendlier and more open way with professionals involved in this court process, I do not consider that it would have been at all possible to manufacture the series of natural interactions with EH that the ISW witnessed.  In particular, she gave examples of their playing games together, EH seeking comfort from her Father following a bump to her head in a delightfully normal and affectionate way, and EH enjoying a sensitively managed visit to the shoe shop.

 

	Towards the end of the hearing I also heard evidence from Mr and Mrs B, who gave delightful, genuine and entirely credible descriptions of their experience of EH.  They had no axe to grind and were giving, without having heard any of the other evidence given during this hearing, natural descriptions of the occasions that they have observed EH over the years.  They describe her as: "laughing, chatty, playful, sometimes shy", "generally very happy", "with a wicked laugh", and not quiet, passive, submissive or unassertive but confidently able to request that her needs are met.  I find that she is not a child damaged such as to show unhealthily cowed or submissive behaviour or other signs of an insecure attachment, and I find her relationship with her father has been observed to be loving, playful, natural and relaxed, and not characteristic of an insecure attachment nor of an over-subdued child quailing at inappropriately authoritarian parenting.  I find that it is not possible to be certain of the cause of EH's apparently quiet behaviour at the FAST assessment, but it is likely to have been affected by the strange environment, the threat of going into foster care, and by her Father feeling stressed and behaving irritably and intolerantly on that occasion.  

 

	The Guardian also added her warning that Ms Mayet's conclusions represented an unwarranted 'leap' from the observed behaviour to the conclusion of a damaged attachment pattern. She commented that if there really were an insecure attachment it would be most surprising for Ms Mayet to have also observed EH playing and chatting with her Father.  A child with such problems would not have behaved that way but would have kept their distance from him.  Given the Guardian's experience and the cogency and breadth of her evidence and analysis, I have no hesitation in accepting her appraisal of Ms Mayet's conclusions, and I find that this was an unjustified extrapolation unsupported by Ms Mayet's own account of other aspects of EH's behaviour.

 

	I unhesitatingly reject Ms Mayet's analysis of EH and her relationship with her Father and prefer the evidence of the Guardian and ISW for all the reasons discussed above.  I find the Social Worker's analysis of this element of the case to be inadequate and overly reliant on Ms Mayet's flawed analysis.  This approach by the Local Authority has meant, however, that they have failed to consider the harmful effects on EH of separation from her parents and of limitation of her contact with them.  I find this separation and limitation would be harmful and discuss it further under the heading Effects Of Change.

 



CAPACITY OF EH'S PARENTS AND MR & MRS B TO MEET HER NEEDS

	Central to this exercise is an understanding, as set out above, of EH's characteristics, needs and any harm she has suffered, and to some but a more limited extent her wishes and feelings.

 



	Mr and Mrs B

 

(a)	B is Mother's brother.  He and his wife have three children and have been very positively assessed by the ISW Catherine Devereux in the Special Guardian report completed jointly with the Social Worker at E157 completed in January 2014.  I have no concerns that they would offer warm, safe and stable care to EH, meeting most of her needs.  Any failure to meet her needs would not be their fault, but simply a consequence of them not being EH's parents to whom she has strong attachments and thus the difficulty that she would experience emotionally in such a placement, and her deep need and interests in being placed with a parent.  

(b)	They are family members and live comparatively nearby so permitting ongoing contact with both parents.

(c)	I do not hold against them any suggestion of poor commitment following the negative viability assessment in 2013.  They were concerned about the legal costs and complications of pursuing the matter further and so did not press the matter until the Guardian took up the baton and applied for them to be independently assessed.

(d)	Nor do I hold against them the issues raised to justify the negative viability assessment.  Mrs B immediately wished to challenge and investigate the suggestion that she had taken a recreational drug when pregnant many years before, and there is nothing other than the initial referral document (F71) to substantiate it.  In any event, I am astonished that a single incident of alleged drug use as a young woman could derail an otherwise positive account of her parenting.  Mr B failed to disclose 4 criminal convictions dating from when he was a very young man.  His explanations for not doing so are reasonable and the record of his life since then is positive, and again I find it surprising that the Local Authority should so readily have discounted many positive aspects of his parenting on this score.  It suggests the Local Authority were determined on an idealised notion of a placement and were not geared towards their obligation to support a child's family life.

(e)	I commend both of them for persisting with offering to care for EH notwithstanding these criticisms and setbacks, and it is thanks to them that I am able to be considering options for EH that do not include a removal from her family into foster care or adoption.

(f)	One further caveat emerged more clearly during the evidence.  It is clear that the relationship between Mr B and Mother has been fragile, tense and fraught in recent years.  This has been in part due, as Mother claims, to her losing D and by implication the reasons why that happened; and also in part due, as Mr B explained and Mother partly admitted, to Mother becoming drunk and disruptive during Mr and Mrs B's wedding in 2008 which greatly upset him.  This will undoubtedly make it harder for an easy flow of information and communication about EH, her progress and contact issues.  I was later told that after Mr and Mrs B gave evidence there had been an emotional reconciliation between Mr B and his sister.  That is wonderful news and one hopes that it leads to closer bonds, support and communication, but I am aware that this arms-length situation has existed for some time and arose as a result of Mother's difficulties, and so may therefore arise again if those difficulties recurred.  It would of course be mitigated to some extent by the enhanced powers held by Special Guardians, but this in itself does not improve the relationships.



	EH's Mother

 

(a)	I have no doubt that Mother loves EH very deeply and is able to show her a great deal of love, warmth and affection.  They have a close relationship, described by the Father as 'excellent'.  Clearly this has at times been impeded when she has been under the influence of alcohol or suffering depressive symptoms or otherwise preoccupied, and I shall return to this topic further below.  

(b)	She has cared for EH all EH's life and is her most familiar carer.  Again, however, there is the caveat that this has been punctuated by periods of inadequate or unavailable care due to Mother's difficulties, and so that care has the negative component of having been inconsistent and neglectful at times.

(c)	Mother claims that she has made significant progress with the areas of concern and so should be considered able to care for EH.  I have also taken into account D's understandably supportive and loving statement dated 9.3.14 in which she praises her Mother's loving nature and the steps her Mother has taken to improve her circumstances.

(d)	The Local Authority and Guardian are concerned that this is simply the same pattern of limited improvement while under pressure which has previously shown deterioration thereafter.  Their argument is that until Mother receives significant help for her underlying difficulties that underpin her depression, response to stress, misuse of alcohol and inability to cope with everyday parenting, that it will be highly unlikely that she can sustain change.  Even the Father, while showing clear signs of loyalty to Mother, has moved to a position where he recognises that despite the Mother's loving relationship with EH that she cannot be relied on to meet all EH's needs.

(e)	Firstly, I have already addressed the issues of domestic violence and my findings in relation to the ongoing risks and lack of insight in that respect, and I find that this is a fundamental issue in considering Mother's capacity to safely meet EH's particular needs.

(f)	In respect of alcohol misuse, I accept that Mother has not drunk since October 2013 save for two glasses of champagne on New Year's Eve.  I note the CRI Spectrum letter dated 10.3.14 (C187a) that this was a lapse and not a full-blown relapse, and that she felt she had let herself down and has returned to abstinence.  Mother is to be thoroughly congratulated in making this progress.  However, this is not the whole story.  Prior to October 2013 there was patchy commitment to her CRI sessions with her keyworker, and he notes that it has improved since then, albeit she has cancelled 3 of the 13 sessions since then and has not seen her keyworker since 5.2.14 due to cancellations by Mother and CRI.  She resisted going to the recovery sessions her keyworker had advised, although I understand that he has now indicated she need not attend those sessions.  Additionally, Mr C drinks alcohol and Mother conceded that he does so in her presence.  

(g)	Dr McClintock's report of July 2013 concluded: "In diagnostic terms JH has shown a recurrent depression in the setting of a psychological dependence on alcohol", and that she has shown "emotionally dependent aspects to her personality" although insufficient to diagnose personality disorder.  He considered her depression to be in remission at the time of assessment and that she should continue with antidepressants and to engage with alcohol services, and while "she has made good progress in the identified areas of concern�she needs to avoid a recurrence of these difficulties.".  He considered that "coping with stress has been a much more longstanding problem for her" and that alcohol was her way of coping with stressful life events.  At that point last year when she was still drinking but less than the daily drinking of March 2013, he considered it was "still early days in terms of her alcohol misuse".

(h)	Unfortunately Mother's childhood experiences have left her feeling hugely preoccupied with troubled feelings from her past and she has described feeling depressive symptoms for some 16-17 years.  She has reported these feelings to the Social Worker, the Guardian, the Father, Dr Pasternak and Dr McClintock.  These longstanding emotional disabilities require assistance so that difficulties do not recur by undermining the progress she has made in avoiding using alcohol to deal with those feelings.  I am pleased to note that Mother has continued taking anti-depressants and reports feeling much better without alcohol.  However, she only undertook CBT in late 2013 after delay of over a year since the recommendation in the Child Protection Plan of October 2012.  She has as a result been referred on for much longer term counselling and has had an initial assessment appointment and is on the waiting list (of about 2-3 months).  She had initially resisted the prospect of further counselling as it scared and worried her, and she told me she felt she was being forced into something she was not ready for.  This led her to lie about having booked an appointment for the counselling in January, when no such appointment was booked.  Having now finally had the assessment appointment she feels much more confident about pursuing this counselling.  However, as with all such therapy, while it is vitally necessary to undertake it, nonetheless the Mother's engagement, its impact and outcome remain uncertain.  Inevitably this does not fit well with meeting EH's needs here and now.

(i)	Mother maintains that she has also made improvements in meeting EH's practical needs.  Mother has been sending EH to school in appropriate clean school uniform and has been attending parents' evenings, and compared to the previous academic year's school attendance of only 84.5% (K1), there was certainly an improvement in school attendance last term to 98.8%.  By late February 2014 her attendance was down to 89%.  Mother claims that this was due to stomach upsets and a throat infection.  However, EH's punctuality has also declined with 16 late attendances out of 28 at the time of the head teacher Ms Morley's letter dated 24.2.14 (C175).  Some late arrivals were only a few minutes late, but other late attendances are considerably later at 9.20am or later.  This is still significant as EH is being offered her extra tuition at 8.45am.  Mother has tried to explain this away by stating that EH is reluctant to go to school due to bullying she has been suffering 'for weeks', but she has also said that EH is reluctant to get out of bed.  EH has not mentioned bullying to the Guardian, the Social Worker, her teacher, her head teacher, nor most significantly to her Father.  Her Father said, at most, there was a single incident of a difficulty with a friend.  The school has no record of having been written to by Mother as she claims, and indeed she told me that she only took a letter in to the school the week before this hearing in early March, whereas the lateness was occurring in January and February.  There has been no mention of this by Mother at any core group meeting where the head teacher regularly attends, and the only record the school has is of a single mention by Mother to EH's teacher of a friendship issue, and no mention of bullying.  Finally, I note that EH herself would not back up her Mother's explanation for repeated lateness when she called EH downstairs to get her to tell the Guardian about the alleged bullying, and looked sullen and would not be encouraged to support what her Mother was saying (E256). Not only was this a wholly inappropriate demand placed upon EH, but unfortunately I am driven to the conclusion that Mother has lied about this bullying to cover repeatedly failing to get up in time and accomplish the simple but important care tasks that get a child to school on time.  This was further highlighted on the last day listed for this hearing on 14.3.14 when Father attended at school to see EH performing in a play at a school assembly before coming to court and found that she had not arrived.  He went to Mother's home, only two minutes walk away from the school, to find that EH was not ready and that Mother had been unable (for whatever reason) to manage to get EH ready.  He tried to find a hairbrush and a hairband for EH's hair but none were available.  He got EH to school but she missed her performance.  I appreciate that this was a tense and stressful moment in the proceedings, and I appreciate that Mother may have felt unwell, but this was a very sad example of Mother's difficulty coping and achieving these basic tasks to meet EH's needs.  Parents have to manage to meet their children's needs in the face of all sorts of adversities; and she could have contacted the Father to ask him to come early and assist.

(j)	Mother also claims that her home is in a better state and is cleaner, tidier and undergoing redecoration, and the Social Worker has confirmed seeing it in a better state.  That is to be commended, but it is extremely recent.  The accounts of the state of the home in previous years are dispiriting, and come from a wide variety of observers.  Although Mother protested to me that EH had not "lived in squalor", it is clear that her environment has been regularly cold, dirty, uncomfortable and ill-suited to a little girls' needs, and EH has described it herself as 'dirty and smelly'.  As recently as 3.2.14 the Social Worker noted it to be cluttered and untidy, with EH's bedroom floor and surfaces covered with bin bags of clothes, newspapers, dirty dishes and food wrappers (G47-49, C134).  On 19.2.14 the Guardian visited (E254) and found the house to be very cold, with dirty floors and insufficient bed linen on EH's bed.  Mother told the Guardian that the heating was not working properly, but then switched on a radiator complaining that it costs a lot to run.  The Social Worker had made similar observations in January and February (C133-4).  The Guardian noted the similarity with the situation that D was exposed to.

(k)	Mother has also found it difficult to achieve or sustain full and open engagement with professionals.  She has missed 3 out of 4 core group meetings held since October 2013, she has cancelled prearranged home visits (C131-3) and has not responded to telephone contact (C132).  She lied to the Social Worker on 3.2.14, falsely claiming that she had to take EH to the dentist in order to avoid an arranged visit and then refused to allow the Social Worker into the home until the police were called.  As identified previously, Mother also lied about and concealed her relationship with Mr C, about EH being bullied and about her therapy appointment in January.  The Social Worker also discovered that she has lied in her recent statement about contacting her GP for her back pain.  While bearing in mind the "Lucas" direction mentioned above, and noting that lying and concealment do not necessarily determine poor parenting capacity, I nonetheless find that in all of these examples save for her therapy and GP appointments EH was directly caught up in the dishonesty, and there is an important but indirect link to Mother's parenting in that without being open and honest and permitting her parenting to be monitored it will be impossible for professionals to become aware of any deterioration in Mother's wellbeing that might have an impact on EH. This has inevitable implications for any attempt to mitigate all the difficulties identified above.

(l)	I have taken into account the unhelpful attitude of the Social Worker from time to time, and which I analyse elsewhere in this judgment, and which I find must have felt upsetting and undermining beyond that which a parent would normally experience in such proceedings.  I do not find that this assists the Mother's case beyond perhaps explaining a resistance to meeting with or talking to the Social Worker.  It does not explain her dishonesty, the failures to meet EH's needs, the risk of exposure to her volatile relationship with Mr C and her lack of insight in that respect; and it bears no direct relationship to Mother's own emotional needs which underlie her difficulty meeting EH's needs adequately.

(m)	Sadly, as identified above, I find that Mother's ability to ensure that EH's needs are met has fluctuated in important respects, improving and deteriorating again, during the course of these proceedings notwithstanding her abstinence, her CBT, her good intentions, her good relationship with EH and her improved relationship with the Father.  I also find that the improvements she has made have either not been sustained or are extremely recent and would appear to be following the repeating pattern of improvement under pressure followed by a failure to sustain that improvement that was seen with D.  



	EH's Father

 

(a)	In marked contrast to the Mother, there is no criticism whatsoever of the Father's abilities to meet EH's physical, practical, and educational needs and to do so in a consistent manner.  He has clearly made every effort to do so as a supplement to the full time care of her Mother.  I am very impressed by the real commitment he has shown EH in maintaining regular good quality contact with her, and for example, not leaving her to get to school by herself when he feared that Mother might fail in that task and sometimes walking 30 minutes each morning to achieve this when he was out of work and had no car.  

(b)	He is in stable accommodation with a friend where he has been able to commit to regular good quality contact with EH that she enjoys and he prioritises.  He is criticised for failing to arrange new accommodation for himself and EH.  But given the uncertainties in the case, I find this delay understandable but regrettable as it does pose some real practical difficulties and a further shift for EH.  I accepted Father's reassurance that he has sufficient funds to obtain private accommodation which gives him a little more flexibility.  He will look for somewhere near enough to her school and friends to be able to maintain those links.  The Local Authority has committed to assisting with a letter of support to the relevant housing department as necessary. 

(c)	I note that the Guardian and the ISW Ms Bennett have both carried out their respective assessments of the Father and are confident that he has the capacity to meet EH's needs.  I must carefully take into account the opinions of two such experienced social work practitioners.

(d)	The principal concerns about Father are the nature of his emotional interaction with EH, his personality and behaviour towards others, and his insight into the need to protect EH from harm.  In summary, the Local Authority's case is that his personality is flawed and disordered leading to maladaptive behaviour towards others; that this in turn has led to a disordered attachment response from EH and a poor relationship between them, and additionally means that the Father cannot work with professionals to meet EH's needs and in particular to accept guidance in regard to parenting and safeguarding EH; and that the Father lacks insight into the harmful experiences EH has suffered. 

(e)	I have addressed his emotional interaction with EH under the heading of harm above, and made findings that her relationship with her Father is in fact very positive, rewarding, affectionate and appropriate, and is not the attachment disordered, fearful, submissive and cowed relationship recounted in the FAST report and adopted by the Social Worker.  

(f)	Ms Mayet also drew conclusions from aspects of the Father's behaviour during the FAST assessment to assert that he does not have the capacity to meet EH's needs.  Ms Mayet considered that Father seemed unable or unwilling to give EH his full attention: reading his newspaper or using his telephone during the assessment and showing an apparent lack of concern for her feelings or needs (E89) and escalating levels of anger and stress.  Father claims that he did not realise quite how the assessment would work and was told to try and be 'normal'.  He thought that this type of interaction with EH was more 'normal', rather than trying especially hard to play/stimulate etc.  He explained that he was very frustrated to have been told to bring DVDs only to find that the television did not work, and also to find that there were no instructions on using the cooker when he had been told to bring a meal to prepare.  He expressed that frustration.  He accepted that he probably came across as arrogant and obnoxious, and I have no doubt that he was at times irritable, unwisely nonchalant and unhelpful.  And at the planning stage he had been difficult and aggressive at a meeting held jointly with the Social Worker (F73).  Ms Mayet went a stage further and made yet another 'leap' � concluding that Father has "personality traits that are noticeably characteristic of a Personality Disorder" (E98).  She recommended a psychological assessment, but repeated this assertion in her addendum, adding "It is important to establish a diagnosis�"(E110).  This, I am driven to find, in conjunction with her oral evidence unfortunately betrays her position, as someone wholly unqualified to do so, that she clearly believed that this was the correct analysis of his personality and one she was entitled to make and rely on.  I note that at E98 Ms Mayet states she concurs with the Local Authority's view at A14 to draw this conclusion.  It appears that she has run with the Local Authority's early and unsubstantiated speculation as to the Father's alleged personality disorder set out in their Position Statement of June 2013.  This is an example of a negative cycle between professionals where previously expressed views affect subsequent analyses and gain unwarranted currency through repetition.  This also unfortunately undermines the Local Authority's assertion that FAST represents an independent assessment of the Father.

(g)	A further, absurd, 'leap' was suggested by Ms Mayet, namely that Father was a serious flight risk.  I have seen no evidence whatsoever to justify this assertion and I note that the Local Authority has not sought to rely on this point before me.

(h)	There are numerous examples of the Father being abusive, hostile and aggressive to the Social Worker.  He admits this.  I have found only one other example of the Father being hostile with another professional: on 21.8.13 he significantly and aggressively obstructed the attempt by Ms Mayet to arrange dates for the FAST assessment, although I note that this meeting took place in the Social Worker's presence (F73).  Otherwise, while other professionals have witnessed this behaviour, for example at the Core Group meetings, and will have found it intimidating and discomforting, there has been no other inappropriate behaviour towards professionals.  The Father explains that this is due to the negative and unprofessional attitude of the Social Worker: ordering him around, expressing the Local Authority's views bluntly and pursuing its position insensitively, and taking up a position against the parents from an early stage.  (I consider this matter elsewhere in this judgment and find some of his criticisms to be well-founded.  However they do not justify his abusive behaviour.)

(i)	He has worked well with the Guardian and the ISW and with both the professionals and the group on the Caring Dads programme (C198-200).  By contrast with the Social Worker, both the Guardian and the ISW Ms Bennett confirmed that they had been able to challenge him robustly without losing his co-operation and his courtesy.  He is noted to communicate well with the school and health professionals.  The ISW witnessed him manage a rude sales assistant with calm politeness.  He has retained good relationships within his own family and clearly has a circle of supportive friends, and I heard impressive evidence of his mature and thoughtful attempt to strike up good family relationships with Mr and Mrs B.  They gave evidence of his instigation in late 2013 of a meeting with them over a meal in order that they should get to know each other better given the possibility that EH could move to their care.  He works in a job that has the potential to cause immense hostility in members of the public and has both retained that job over many years and has only minor and historical criminal convictions and no relevant concerning forensic history. 

(j)	I also note that despite his outbursts, he has in fact complied with all the requests made of him, such as taking EH for a longer staying weekend at short notice in March 2013, attending meetings, undergoing the FAST assessment, attending all 17 weekly sessions of the Caring Dads programme etc.  In relation to the latter, he contributed well, reflected openly in the group sessions and in feedback with the Guardian, and had the humility to recognise that this was in fact of real benefit to him and not simply the 'tick box' exercise he had formerly called it. 

(k)	I have already dismissed Ms Mayet's analysis of EH's relationship with her Father for the reasons discussed earlier in this judgment.  I find that here, too, Ms Mayet has hugely overstepped any reasonable analysis of her observations.  Clearly, conclusions can and should be drawn that Father can behave in an obnoxious, hostile, aggressive and intimidating manner, and has done so to the Social Worker.  This is unacceptable and must be avoided in order to preserve good working relationships that will ensure that EH's future needs are best met.  But this is a far cry, where there are numerous examples of contrasting positive social interactions, from someone who is personality disordered.

(l)	I found the Guardian's analysis of the situation to be highly persuasive and to fit best with the evidence I heard from the Father and his presentation.   The Father is a physically big and tall man with a loud voice, and it became clear during his evidence that he is both a very emotional man and someone with strong views who would not like to be told what to do or think in such a way that he would feel ordered about, but preferably in a manner so that he could more readily reflect and accept it.  The Guardian posited that his reactions to the Social Worker and during meetings involving her were a fight/flight type reaction prompted by the fear/threat she posed to him by taking the position that EH should be removed from the family's care.  As such, I consider that there is a risk that EH will be exposed from time to time to certain aspects of his personality and behaviour that are imperfect and reflect his emotional and occasionally hostile responses in circumstances where he feels ill-treated and threatened.  

(m)	I do not find that this flaw is sufficient to conclude, as the Local Authority does, that he is incapable of meeting EH's needs.  EH will be exposed to his positive and his negative personality traits, as all children are exposed to their parents' personalities.  I do not accept that this is so grave here, in circumstances where he has an otherwise good relationship with EH and can clearly interact well with others when treated with consideration and a sense of working in partnership, that he will be unable to meet EH's needs for warmth and balance in his responses to her, or that he will be unable to work with or learn from others to protect her.

(n)	I have considered aspects of his insight into protecting EH from harm in relation to exposure to domestic conflict and have found that there are gaps in this element of his understanding.  Having heard Father give evidence it is clear that he has minimised or failed to understand the gravity of exposure to repeated domestic conflict on children.  This ran over into his failure to grasp the risk implications for EH of Mother's relationship with Mr C.  Further assistance and support is required in this area, but I do not consider it is so grave or irremediable that it should prevent Father from caring for EH, particularly where the parents' relationship appears to have hugely stabilised in the past 6 months whereby they were able to convey a true sense of working together in EH's interests rather than engaging in conflict.

(o)	Minimisation or a failure to comprehend the implications of ongoing drinking by a recovering alcohol misuser also emerged from his evidence.  Father told me that so long as she was not drinking during contact he did not object to her limited drinking at other times.  It was argued on his behalf that so long as she is not drunk or unstable, it is clearly in EH's best interests to still have contact with Mother in the event that she is unable to remain abstinent.  I agree, so long as problems do not flow over into contact.  However, the impression given was that Father did not fully understand the problems associated with what is called 'controlled drinking' when abstinence has been recommended by professionals.  Father dismissed the idea that he may need further enlightenment on this point, but I consider that this is an area where he may find himself better armed for the future if he takes advantage of becoming better informed of these issues.  I am confident that the Father has the capacity to work on these aspects of his skills given the positive accounts of his work with Caring Dads.

(p)	Another area where it was evident that the Father lacked insight into the harmful implications for EH was his wishful thinking over the past months and years that the warmth of the relationship between EH and her Mother would make up for repeatedly neglectful care and exposure to her Mother's drinking, depression and difficulties coping.  He is clearly very loyal to Mother and it is only recently and slowly that Father has realised that he had to assert his position over Mother's.  I got the distinct impression that he was doing his utmost not to hurt Mother more than absolutely necessary and may have ducked this difficult challenge whenever he saw she had made some improvements � he became tearful when having to consider the impact upon Mother of EH leaving her care, and acknowledged that Mother probably relies on him as her first port of call.  Notably, his own evidence was that she only makes changes when placed under extreme pressure to do so.  That being said, I acknowledge that becoming abstinent must have seemed and must continue to seem to the Father to be a really major step forward by Mother and made it much harder to perceive that he should step in.  Despite this loyalty and failure to see the wood for the trees for many months in these proceedings, I do not consider that this poses a real risk for EH at this point.  He is now clearly fully committed to caring for her and robustly explained how he would check out Mother's stability before any contact or manage any communication from Mother, relying on his long experience of her to be able to interpret her condition.  He will also be supported in this by the Supervision Order � so long as he is able to co-operate and take advantage of its services, and I am confident that, if it is managed appropriately by the Local Authority, he can do so.  



	The Local Authority

 

(a)	I deal with this issue here, not because the local authority's capacity to care for EH arises, but because its approach has had an evident impact on all those discussed above, and with the agreement by all parties that there should be a Supervision Order it is clear that the Local Authority's future conduct of the case will have an important effect upon EH's future care.

(b)	The parents, Mr and Mrs B and the Guardian have all raised concerns about the approach taken by the Local Authority in general and this Social Worker in particular.  

(c)	I am aware that it can be said that parents are bound to criticise a Social Worker involved in child protection proceedings relating to their child, and that the Social Worker is in a no-win situation, but it is not as simple as that.  The roles a social worker and a local authority play are crucial and must demonstrate a real effort to work in partnership with a family, a readiness to try and rebuild a family and identify support to do so, a fair and robust analysis of all the information available, and sensitive interaction with the family to support all the above.

(d)	I have already noted a number of concerning features earlier in this judgment: a failure by the Social Worker to include and consider carefully all the available evidence of the Father's relationship and interaction with EH, and particularly her own s37 analysis; an unquestioning acceptance of the extreme analysis of the FAST assessor; a failure to include in the social work analysis of EH's presentation during the FAST assessment crucial information that the Mother had told EH she might be removed into foster care and other potentially relevant factors; a failure to provide any adequate analysis of EH's needs in terms of her close and loving relationships with her parents and the impact upon her of being removed from their care with limited contact; and an excessively rigid and negative reaction to the concerns raised in Mr and Mrs B's viability assessment.

(e)	As already mentioned, the downturn in the Local Authority's approach and the parents' relationship with the Local Authority and the Social Worker appears to have begun with the angry response received by the Social Worker and Practice Manager Jenny Jones in mid-March 2013 when Father was requested at short notice to extend his weekend staying contact.  The negative viability assessment of Mr and Mrs B by the Social Worker followed in May 2013.  This appears to have been communicated excessively bluntly and negatively to Mr and Mrs B, according to their account to the Guardian (E125).  I take into account that they were not questioned directly about this while giving evidence and so I have to rely on the Guardian's account of her conversation with them, but I also note that they were not challenged that this had been their experience, and I find that they had no reason to lie about this to the Guardian and they came across as entirely honest and helpful witnesses.  I have subsequently seen an entirely proper letter, sent on 5.6.13 shortly after these conversations took place, setting out advice to Mr and Mrs B as to what steps they could take.  By then however, that damage was done.

(f)	The proceedings were then issued and first steps taken to progress the case.  On 21.8.13 a FAST planning meeting took place between the Social Worker, Ms Mayet the FAST assessor and the Father.  I have already found that his approach was hostile and unhelpful in trying to arrange dates for the FAST assessment.  However, it was followed by the Social Worker, later at the same meeting, pressing Father to sign adoption medical consent and parental health forms.  I accept the Guardian's evidence that this was poor professional practice, and in any event it lacked sensitivity or any awareness of the meaning of these proceedings and assessments for the parents.  A meeting about the Local Authority's plan for adoption (even if a parallel plan) should not ride immediately on the back of a meeting that is about the assessment of that parent's parenting.  It will instantly undermine the parent's faith in that assessment, particularly where the Local Authority is the assessor, and will appear to be grossly insensitive and as if the Local Authority are approaching the case with a closed mind.  A separate meeting with a proper explanation of the parallel planning process should have been conducted.

(g)	A similar and wholly unnecessary pressure and insensitivity was evident in the Social Worker's actions on 8.11.13.  On that date DJ Pilling's judgment relating to the parents' and Guardian's applications for further assessment by ISWs was awaited from the contested hearing the day before on 7.11.13, and was handed down by email on the afternoon of 8.11.13.  However, the Social Worker persisted with a meeting with Mother on 8.11.13, with the approval of her manager Jenny Jones, at which she sat with her for a lengthy period of time persuading her to complete parts of the Child Permanence Report which covers the views of the parent in relation to the proposed plan for adoption and contains a section relating to what information the parent would like the child to know in the future if adopted.  I have seen that document.  Understandably, the Mother described herself as intensely distressed by this exercise. The excuse for putting this highly vulnerable Mother through this was that the Social Worker had to prepare documents for the Agency Decision Maker to consider the Local Authority's plan for adoption and that she would have been in trouble if the documents were not ready.  However, she of course conceded that as soon as an assessment is to be carried out an ADM is not in a position to approve a plan for adoption, and of course it turned out that DJ Pilling's judgment confirmed that both the Father and Mr and Mrs B should be further and independently assessed.  Simply waiting one day for that decision would have saved the Mother a great deal of unnecessary distress and saved the Social Worker a waste of her time on preparing wholly unneeded documents.  I could not fathom what drove the Social Worker and her manager to continue with this course of action in those circumstances.  It cannot but have led the family to be convinced that the Local Authority was not prepared to think supportively and openly about the possibility of EH remaining in her family, and that the Social Worker was prepared to put the Mother through an intensely distressing experience come what may.

(h)	Given that one of the key criticisms of the Mother was that she was failing to engage with the Social Worker, and of the Father was that he was aggressive and abusive to the Social Worker, I find it astonishing that she should take (or have been advised to take) such insensitive steps that cannot but have worsened the prospect of improving her working relationship with each of them.

(i)	The Guardian was also concerned that the Social Worker called the police twice to EH's home, in summer 2013 and February 2014.  She considered that this was excessive and heavy-handed, particularly where a child is attending school and contact with another parent, and she could be seen through the window in summer 2013.  It had a frightening impact on EH and again must have led the family to feel that the Social Worker had an excessively negative attitude towards the family.

(j)	I note and accept that the Social Worker has agreed with hindsight in her oral evidence that some of these steps were not best practice and expressed regret through the Local Authority's advocate for some of these actions.  However, the matter unfortunately goes a stage further.

(k)	In her final statement dated 21.2.14 at C143 the Social Worker reported a comment of the Mother's that she had not in fact wanted the Father to spend Christmas with her and EH.  The Social Worker then used this comment to suggest that the Father was again being inappropriately overbearing and that the Mother was being excessively weak, with consequent damaging exposure of EH to their relationship difficulties.  However, during her oral evidence the Social Worker let slip that the Mother had in fact invited the Father to come for Christmas as EH had requested it.  This is wholly absent from her written account and as a result it becomes a distorted and wholly misleading version of what occurred.  Nowhere is the Mother's willing and appropriate response to her daughter's request mentioned.  I am astonished that this could be characterised by the Social Worker as the Father overlooking the Mother's feelings and the Mother being too uncomfortable to assert her wishes against him, when it was clearly nothing of the sort.  This level of distortion to fit the Local Authority's case is unhelpful in the extreme, unprofessional and frankly a misrepresentation of the true situation.

(l)	Additionally, last week the Social Worker concedes that she answered Mother's questions about what would happened at the end of this case by openly discussing in front of EH the need to pack a bag for EH.   I fail to see how this should have arisen at all.  The Social Worker should have either had this discussion long before with the Mother or should have deflected her questions so as to have the conversation in EH's absence.  This was a hugely insensitive and potentially destabilising discussion for EH to overhear.  It is frankly flabbergasting to hear that that a child protection professional has acted this way.  It is as if the child's feelings are invisible.

(m)	I must express my disappointment at having to consider these examples of the Local Authority failing to approach this case sensitively and with the aim of truly working in partnership with a family, and I consider that the family's concerns as to the insensitive and negative approach they have been treated to are justified.  Some examples appear to be the responsibility of the Social Worker and some of her management within her team.  The attitudes betrayed by these examples must change for the Supervision Order to be properly administered by the Local Authority in EH's interests.  This is particularly the case given my findings in relation to EH and her Father that do not follow the Local Authority's position adopted thus far.

(n)	I am very grateful to the Local Authority for the addendum document dated 13.3.14 which adds to their care plan.  I am also grateful for the Local Authority's decision of which I have been informed this morning: to change the team which will be responsible for the Supervision Order.  The Local Authority had originally confirmed that the Social Worker would change but that the team would remain the same and the manager Jenny Jones would remain in direct charge of the case. The Guardian had expressed the view that it would be preferable for the team and the manager to change.  While aware of the limitations on my powers, I concurred and I had invited the Local Authority to think carefully and creatively about how to achieve the fresh start that it appears from the concerns set out above are urgently required to serve this family fairly, to enable the Local Authority, the Senior Social Worker and the Professional Assistant to look at these parents with a fresh eye, and to be able to work in partnership with them successfully.  I had reminded the Local Authority to consider the guidance of Sir James Munby P in Re BS (2013) at �29 in terms of doing what is necessary to make the orders of the court work and not to be limited by resource arguments.



EFFECT OF ANY CHANGE ON EH

	If she remains with her mother there is the least change and there will be no impact on EH save for a continuation of the current circumstances which for various reasons discussed elsewhere in this judgment are considered to be neglectful of her needs and harmful for her, and which to some extent she has wished could be different.

 

	If she were to move to her father's care this would result in switching to contact with her mother instead of living full time with her.  She would be spared the risk of witnessing her mother's dysfunctional use of alcohol (if that were to recur), and she would no longer be exposed on a day to day basis to her mother's difficulties with coping, ranging from her feelings of depression and lack of motivation through to practical issues such as ensuring that she gets to school regularly and on time.  This would be disruptive and upsetting in the sense of it being a change from her normal experience and spending less time with her mother, but would also meet her wishes and feelings to live in a clean, stable environment where her needs are more consistently met and where her father does not suffer from these debilitating difficulties.  Her positive relationship with her Father would continue and be reinforced and would amply meet her emotional needs as discussed earlier in this judgment.

 

	She will undoubtedly have more contact with her Mother than if she were to live with Mr and Mrs B, and significantly it is likely to be more natural and with less strain and less requirement for more formal supervision.  

 

	The Guardian has recommended that for the first two weeks there is one supervised contact per week and brief telephone contact if necessary to reassure EH.  Thereafter that it should increase to twice weekly in the community so that EH is not unsettled by returning to her previous home.  Father will have to review Mother's condition before contact begins but upon being satisfied that she is stable and sober contact need not necessarily be supervised.  Contact should not return to EH's home nor take place overnight until Mother has made some progress both in relation to the physical environment and her own therapy, and that it should not move on to those stages without review, consultation and agreement with the Local Authority.  The Father imagined something closer to his current contact arrangements where overnight weekend contact takes place, but I gained the impression of his increasing preparedness to adapt his approach (as has been borne out in the Agreement I have seen this morning).  

 

	EH might be able to remain at her current school, dependent upon where her Father moves to and how her Mother reacts to living so close to the school but not having EH in her care.  This would ensure she has important continuity of schooling in terms of friends, teachers, and a supportive pastoral environment at a difficult time.  Initially the Guardian had recommended a change of school would be necessary, but upon hearing the Father's evidence she now prefers to try and support EH remaining at her current school to avoid further disruption and preserve positive support for her, dependent upon and reviewable in relation to the factors outlined above.  

 

	If EH were to move to her uncle and aunt, EH would no doubt be well cared for in terms of her physical and educational needs, and they would offer her a warm and stable home, where they have experience of caring for children and meeting their needs.   However, she would experience a really significant disruption to her care and to her emotional and social world.  She has never lived with them, but knows them and their children through occasional extended family activities and has had a sleepover there.  She would be moving to a new home, where three other children live.  She would be obliged to change school with all the uncertainty, strangeness, and insecurity that entails, with losses of friendships and relationships with teachers that she currently enjoys.  She would be unsure of her new situation and would feel for some considerable time, and perhaps always, that she was to a greater or lesser extent an outsider to their family unit.  She would feel intense loss and sadness at not being able to live with either of her parents.  

 

	Mr and Mrs B suggested that Mother should have monthly supervised contact, and supervised by the local authority for the duration of the Supervision Order.  They suggested that contact with her Father could be fortnightly staying contact arranged flexibly around their own family activities.

 

	The Local Authority's plan proposes that the levels of contact are reduced to only once every two months with each of her parents; the Mother's supervised and the Father's supported by a supervisor for the first three months due to their concern about his acceptance of the placement.  This would be a massive drop in her ability to interact with her beloved parents given she lives with her mother and currently spends three days and a night each week with her father.  She would feel confused, lonely and bereft.  The Social Worker's analysis in her written statements and oral evidence singularly failed to address this issue.  There was no adequate discussion in the relevant parts of her statement of these issues, there is no mention of the fundamental importance of these relationships to EH, of the love she feels and the loss she would feel and any harm that this would cause; and in her oral evidence the Social Worker was only able to talk in terms of EH experiencing 'difficulties' and 'tensions'.  This is a revealing failure and has led me to consider that the Local Authority generally and the Social Worker in particular have not included in their analysis of the options for EH a full understanding of the impact upon her.  I am unsure of the reasons for this important failure.  Is it because they do not wish to acknowledge the importance to EH of her relationships with her parents?  Or because the impact upon her sits very uncomfortably with their recommendation?  Or because the inclusion of these effects upon her in any analysis might outweigh the argument for moving her from her parents' care?  Or simply and shockingly that it went unconsidered?  Whatever the reason, the Local Authority/Social Worker analysis is therefore flawed in this respect and I must and do look carefully at this element of the case.  

 



ORDERS AND CONCLUSIONS

	All the parties agree that a Supervision Order should be made in any event. I agree.  It is obviously in EH's best interests that the Local Authority is able to advise, assist and befriend her, including by means of supporting her parents.  I consider that this support should in particular include: the assistance with any contact supervision that may be necessary that the Father feels unable to provide; review of the progression of contact; monitoring and support of Mother's progress with therapy and abstinence; additional information and support for Father relating to the impact of domestic abuse and the complications of recovery from alcohol misuse.

 

	As will have been apparent through the reasoning set out above I have considered the three options for EH and the full range of orders and powers that could apply.  I have done so by exploring all the implications for EH in an holistic fashion and by reference to the welfare checklist factors.  I have borne in mind the particular manner in which each parent or carer's capacity to care for EH interplays with her needs and characteristics, and interplays with that parent or carer's role in relation to any harm EH has suffered or is at risk of suffering and I have further considered the effect on EH of each proposal.  I have considered her wishes and feelings, while being aware of her age and stage of development in relation to her expression of her wishes and the weight to be given to her wishes and feelings.  In undertaking this exercise I have considered the pros and cons of each proposal.

 

	Overall I conclude that while Mr and Mrs B could care well for EH, her welfare interests generally and her relationships with her parents in particular dictate that she should be cared for by one of her parents if possible, and given my findings that should be her Father; and I do not find that there is any basis to require the imposition of the enhanced parental responsibility of a Special Guardianship Order.

 

	Taken as a whole, I am quite sure that Mother wants to do her best for EH and loves her dearly, but I am also keenly aware that Mother remains a highly vulnerable person who from time to time is overwhelmed and unable to cope.  While she has made some important improvements, and it remains vital for Mother and EH that she continues with those significant steps, there are key areas of risk and lack of insight that mean EH would continue to be at ongoing risk of neglect and some harm in her Mother's care.  I do not consider a shared residence order could protect against these problems given the history.  While it might be argued that this might be the least interventionist approach, those arguments are outweighed by the risks I have identified.

 

	Turning to EH's Father, I have not found to be established any factor that makes the Father incapable of meeting EH's needs, and I find that while there are factors that require further assistance and support they are not sufficiently grave to prevent him providing good enough care, particularly in the context of a Supervision Order.  Additionally, I have found that there are positive factors indicative of the Father's positive capacity to provide good enough and also better than good enough care to EH.  He is not perfect, but is in the best position overall to meet most of EH's needs very well.

 

	In considering all the factors in the welfare checklist and balancing all the competing evidence, it is quite clear that the most proportionate decision looking at EH's best interests lies in moving to live with her Father under a residence order, having regular good quality contact with her Mother as advised by the Guardian, and in being supported in these arrangements by the Local Authority under a Supervision Order.

 

	In terms of that good quality of contact, given the issues I have identified above in considering EH's needs, the harm she has suffered and her Mother's capability to meet her needs, plus the inevitable disruptive effects upon the whole family of any change of carer, I consider the Guardian's recommendations as to contact to best meet EH's needs during the currency of the Supervision Order and while the new arrangement settles and Mother starts engaging with her therapy.

 

	I am very glad that the parties can set out in the terms of a written agreement the expectations and commitments of the parents and the Local Authority that will preclude the need for any contact orders and will set the path for the future.  It is vital that there is positive co-operation between all parties in the interests of EH's welfare. 

 

	I am well aware how painful this process is for any family.  I again express my gratitude to Mr and Mrs B, and I wish her parents the very best in enjoying their parenthood of EH.

JUDGMENT

 

01����� I am concerned with three children, all
girls; X, who is 13, having born on 20th September 2000; Y, who is
seven, born on 11th March 2007; and Z, who is five, born on 21st
May 2008.�� This is the final hearing of the application of R for a care order
for each child.� The parties are R, the Borough Council; M, the mother of the
three children; X, who is separately represented at the final hearing; and the
younger children, who act by their guardian.� On the fifth day of the hearing
the father of the younger two children, G, was represented by counsel although
he did not attend, but he (G) has participated during the latter stages of this
hearing.� They have been represented before me by Miss Kelleher for R; Mr Elcombe
for M; Mr O�Brien for G; Miss Young for X; and Miss Hardy for Y and Z, who
takes her instructions from the guardian for the three children, Debra
Jennings.� 

 

02����� I have read a large ring binder of documents
prepared for the hearing including statements from the social workers and from
M; a psychiatric assessment of M by Dr Oyabodi; a psychological assessment of
the children by Dr Williamson; a parenting assessment by the Marigold Family
Centre; two reports from the guardian.� I have read many of the contact notes
and I have read many pieces of paper which have been presented during the
course of the hearing.� I have heard oral evidence from Ellie al-Fayad, the
manager at the Marigold, who was not the author of the Marigold report but had
supervised the work and the report, and the report writer no longer worked for
the Marigold.� I heard evidence from Julie Brown, the social worker for the
children since mid-December; from Kelly Ekwonobi, M�s Probation Officer; from
M; from G; and from the guardian.� 

 

03����� By way of background, M was born in Country
L and came to this country 14 years ago and all three children were born here.�
The family is now British or in the process of completing becoming British.�
The children�s fathers play no part in these proceedings save that the father
of the younger two, G, has been involved in the latter days of the hearing.�
The father of X sadly died in 2001 in Country L and X has never met him.� M has
had three elder daughters by X�s father, two of whom have tragically died in
young adulthood in Country L.� It is accepted by all parties save for G that M
came to live in the R area because she was rehoused there via a refuge � indeed
two refuges � with the children as a result of fleeing domestic violence from
G.� She and the children have been in various refuges and places of safety
since 2009.� In 2004 M accepts that she left X alone when X was very young and
asleep at night for a short period.� In 2009 M was cautioned for leaving her
three children unattended and they were aged between nine months and nine
years.� Also in 2009 was the death of one of M�s daughters in Country L.� 

 

04����� In 2011 M sought assistance from the local
authority to look after the children because she had to go to Country L.� I am
unclear whether this was to care for her adult daughter who was ill or to bury
that daughter but either way sadly that daughter died and M was not given help
to enable her to go to Country L.� It has been in my judgment an important
factor in this case that M has been desperate to go to Country L since 2011 to
pay her respects at her two daughters� graves but has been unable to do so
until recently.� She has now managed to go whilst the children have been in
foster care.� M has been assessed by a psychiatrist, who found no sign of
mental illness.� She had, all acknowledge, been grieving for her daughters.� It
is an issue in the case whether M has sufficiently protected her younger three
children from her emotional distress.� In late 2011 to early 2012 M was given
counselling and advice about historical domestic violence.� 

 

05����� R assessed the children in late 2011 and it
was apparent that the main issue was M�s emotional distress and the impact on
the children as well as X being left often to look after the younger children.�
The social worker did not have concerns for the children�s welfare and said
there was no indication of alcohol misuse, which had been raised as a possible
issue, or of poor management of the home environment.� Social Care closed their
case in February 2012, having referred M for further support for her
bereavement and experiences of domestic violence.� 

 

06����� In September 2012 another request came via
the Dove Project.� M wanted/needed to go to Country L.� Her need to find out
what had happened to her two daughters and to visit their graves had not been
dealt with.� The referrer said that the children seemed very happy.� The
referral was made because M had made arrangements for a friend to care for the
children and the referrer thought that Social Care should know.� No help was
forthcoming and the trip did not take place.� 

 

07����� In the chronology there is then a report
dated 10th September 2012 which says: 

 

��������� �Police called to family home by Mr S
[M�s boyfriend] who advised that M had smacked her daughter around the head
and had been drinking.� Deemed to be malicious as M had ended the relationship
with Mr S on that day.�� 

 

��������� The social worker�s statement says
however: 

 

��������� �The police officers interviewed X, who
confirmed M�s story that she had smacked Z on the bottom as an act of parenting
discipline for stealing sweets from sister Y.� The attending police officers
advised they had no Child Protection concerns, their predominant concerns
around not having a working boiler and heating the house with a small heater
which the family could not afford.�� 

 

��������� In other words the chronology is wholly
misleading.� After the police alerted Social Care to this event two visits were
made and again it was noted that M was very upset.� A Family Support Worker was
then engaged but I have been told nothing as to what support was given.

 

08����� On 16th March 2013 the children
came under police protection and then into care � voluntary care under Section
20 � as a result of M leaving the children unattended and it would have been
overnight.� M has admitted this although she says she had made some rather loose
arrangement with a neighbour and pleaded guilty to child cruelty and has
received a community order and a Probation Order, which is still current.� This
is dealt with in the threshold document.� The children have remained
accommodated ever since.

 

09����� These proceedings were conducted in the FPC
until the final hearing came before me.� I have had therefore no opportunity to
ensure that the correct case management took place.� It has not.� These
proceedings have been conducted by the local authority in a seriously troubling
manner.� I am told that an internal inquiry has now started.� The inadequacies
relate to the social work and the legal work.� G was only found between the
case being adjourned on Day 4 and resuming on Day 5, a week later, over a year
after it started.� The information which led to the father being found was on
Social Care�s file.� These are the circumstances.� On Day 3 I was told that the
guardian had spoken the previous evening to the girls� foster carer who told
her of an incident last August when the younger girls had told her of something
their mother had done to Z which the foster carer had been concerned to hear.�
The foster carer told the guardian that she had told the social worker at the
time.� The allegation was, I was told, of sufficient seriousness � though I was
not told what it was � for it to be necessary for me to adjourn, and I did so
on Day 3 to allow the social worker and the local authority�s lawyer to go and
read the files.� I wanted to know if there was any record on Social Care�s
file.� On Day 4 in the afternoon the case resumed and I was told that there was
nothing about the allegation on the files.� There was however a deleted email
sent by the foster carer at the time to the social worker and to the Foster
Care Manager.� Nobody knows whether these were even read.� I was told more
about the allegation because it seemed to be agreed that I should be, and
having heard that I allowed the social worker to speak to the girls about the
allegation reported by the foster carer and for X�s solicitor to take
instructions and for the guardian to do what she thought right.� I refused to
allow the local authority to introduce other matters which their advocate told
me were also found when she was trawling through the files, but which did not
relate directly to physical abuse of any of the children.� I was also told that
information had been found on the file which might lead to G being traced.� The
case had to go over for a week for investigations of the allegations to be
carried out. �When the case resumed on 7th April Mr O�Brien appeared
for G, G having gone to the wrong court.� The local authority had managed to
trace him but this could have been done months ago.� Mr O�Brien clearly needed
time to read the papers with his client and so we had to adjourn again until 8th
April.� Most of three days of court time has therefore been lost, 26th
and 27th March and 7th April.� Other cases have had to
lose their hearing slots and my time and other people�s time has been wasted.�
I will deal with the material that emerged from the additional disclosure and
inquiries later in this judgment.� 

 

10����� What I will say at this time is this; I only
discovered on Day 5 when the social worker was recalled to give evidence that
it was not by chance that the guardian was told of the allegation by the foster
carer as to what the younger children had disclosed to her in August.� It
emerged during that evidence that the social worker was telling the foster
carer about the hearing in some detail, I conclude, after the social worker had
completed giving her evidence but in the middle of the hearing, and the foster
carer apparently asked if the August disclosure had not been dealt with.� The
social worker told the foster carer she did not know about this but as she had
given her evidence the foster carer should mention this to the guardian, who
would be ringing her later.� I was not told any of this, nor indeed was Mr Elcombe.�
I was led to believe, as he was, that the foster carer just happened to mention
this information to the guardian on the evening after Day 2.� I did not know
that the social worker had directed the foster carer to inform the guardian of
this information.� 

 

11����� The local authority have not acted properly
with regard to this at all.� I agree with the submission made by Miss Young
that the social worker formed the view that the case was not going well and
took it upon herself to engineer more evidence being introduced.� A local
authority in care proceedings has certain duties which include to act fairly.�
They have not done so.� I stated clearly on 7th April after the
receipt of the new information and the arrival of G�s representative that my
preliminary view was that the case had to be completed this week; that the
choices I had were to send the children home to their mother or for them to
remain in foster care under a care order.� If the children went home there
might be an issue of contact to their father to consider but that was unlikely
to be an issue which could be resolved this week.� If the children could not go
home to their mother the case would be likely to be resolved by them remaining
in foster care for the time being under a care order with any assessment of the
father to take place thereafter if he was wanting to care for any of the girls.�
No advocate demurred from this although Mr O�Brien had not as yet had the
opportunity to read any of the papers.� It was only on the next day when Miss
Kelleher for R expressed the view but did not formally apply to adjourn that
the father needed to be assessed; that no decisions could be made without that
being done; and that a risk assessment of the father could be done in four
weeks and the case resumed, as far as I understood her to be saying, at that
point.�� I disagreed.� I said it was not realistic to imagine that a father who
had not seen the girls for over four years could take over the care of the
girls, even if� he was assessed positively in a risk assessment and even if all
the allegations of domestic violence were found to be incorrect, within any
reasonable time.� The issue before me remained whether the mother, who has
always cared for the girls, could resume their care at this time or not.� Only
if she could not would it make sense to look at G and that would then have to
be done by the local authority after these proceedings concluded with a care
order.� The issue of contact was a separate one.� No preparation had been done
to resolve that issue and it could not be dealt with in the time scale of these
proceedings.� I am not surprised that the guardian agreed with these views in
her evidence.� 

 

12����� G produced in his evidence on 8th
April, which was Day 5, the initial assessment from 2009 of the London Borough
of Merton where the family once lived.� I have been given no explanation as to
why the local authority have never obtained proper information including such
documents from Merton.� It seemed obvious to me that further assessments and
case conference Minutes must be available and I was not impressed by the local
authority belatedly trying to rely on this one document on its own to further
their case out of context.� I was even less impressed by the local authority
appearing to accept and adopt the statement of G, a man of whom they have no
knowledge and have not assessed, but whom they understand � and certainly that
is the thrust of the evidence to date � to be the perpetrator of domestic
violence on M, some of which has been witnessed by one or more of the children.�
The fact that G says he thought M had only two children in Country L as opposed
to three was not the basis for Miss Kelleher to cross-examine M on, questioning
presumably whether she had lied about the existence of her children who had
died.� It was also wrong in the circumstances to ask G questions about
parenting customs in Country L as if he was able to give the court expert or
remotely independent evidence.� The lack of judgment I have seen has been
shocking.� I did ask Miss Kelleher before she started cross-examining G,
because I was surprised in the circumstances that she was doing so, whether she
had instructions.� It is now clear to me that she did not understand the
question which related to the basic rules of advocacy.� The lines of
questioning by Miss Hardy and Miss Young in contrast were wholly appropriate.�
Mr Elcombe rightly took the view that he was not in a position to cross-examine
G as he had not had the opportunity to obtain full instructions and there was
insufficient documentary evidence yet obtained.� 

 

13����� The internal inquiry which is taking place
in R needs also to address the issue of the approach of this authority to a
family from another culture.� I have been judging full-time for 12 years in London before coming to Essex.�� In London it was an everyday occurrence for the families
being considered by the courts and the local authorities to come from outside
the UK.� I have conducted many trials involving people from various countries
in Africa, although I cannot recall whether I have dealt with a case of a
family from Country L before or not.� These cases are prepared and presented
fairly and appropriately.� It may be that there is little experience in R of
such cases but the approach in R is not one I have met before.� My strong
impression is that this family has not been treated fairly throughout this process
and my strong impression is that they would have been treated differently if
they had been white and the mother British born.� There has been no
consideration of M�s different culture background or that of her children.� The
level of ignorance displayed has been shocking.� The fact that she struggles to
understand and express herself has not been thought about.� She has been
treated with unreasonable and undue suspicion about irrelevant matters such as
where she earns her money and about her family in Country L.� I also do not
think a white British mother who had had two of her daughters die in this
country within two years of each other would have been treated with the very
limited compassion this mother has received.� I have noted a lack of respect
for this mother and a failure to treat her properly in these proceedings.�
These children have only been accommodated, there have been no interim care
orders, and M�s request for more contact or different contact has not
apparently been considered.� I was told today that there have been ongoing
discussions about how a rehabilitation process would work but no one has
thought to consult the children�s mother.� Most breathtaking of all is the fact
that the Marigold Family Resource Centre in their assessment concluded in
August 2013 that these children should be adopted.� At the time they were
twelve, seven and five, and the idea was preposterous.� However, the local
authority accepted the recommendation and adoption became their care plan.�
This care plan is unique in my experience.� I have had to form the view that
this family has been treated differently from other families in R.� 

 

14����� The local authority plan now is for the
children to remain in foster care.� It is planned that they stay with their
current carer.� The contact plan is for the girls to see their mother six times
a year but for X to see her an additional twice on her own.� The plan is for
each contact to be for two hours and initially at least to be supervised.� M
does not accept the local authority plan and seeks to have the children
returned to her care.� She challenges the assessment of her as not having been
carried out properly.� If the children do not return to her care she wants a
more generous contact arrangement.� G, who has not had the opportunity to be
assessed or to put his case, agrees that the children should be made the
subject of care orders.� He wants to be assessed for contact thereafter.� X
wants to live with her mother.� However she is pulled both ways as she also
wants to look after and live with her younger sisters.� If the court thought
that she could come home but not her sisters she would choose to stay with her
sisters.� The guardian supports the local authority�s plans for a care order
with long-term fostering and also for contact.� She has found that aspect of
the case the more difficult.� She recognises that all three children, not just
X, want to return to their mother�s care.� 

 

15����� The threshold criteria for the making of
orders pursuant to Section 31 are set out in a document which was agreed at a
hearing in September 2013 and has been amended for this hearing.� Mr O�Brien
confirmed in his submissions that G does not agree with it because it refers to
him as the perpetrator of domestic violence which he denies.� That has not been
litigated yet.� I acknowledge that he does not accept that part of the
document.� I have read the document and I approve it.� 

 

16����� The issues I have to decide are these.� What
is in the best interests of each of these girls?� Do I agree with the local
authority that they have properly assessed the mother and the father, and that
their conclusion that the children would be emotionally harmed if they returned
to their mother is right?� If so, have the local authority got the right level
of contact for these girls in their plans?� Alternatively, do I consider that
the local authority have not assessed this family properly, bearing in mind
their background and the mother�s experiences?� If so, what is the way
forward?� Do I agree with the assessment either way?� Should the girls or any
of the children return to the mother�s care now, or is there any other work
which should be carried out?� Is there support which could go into this family
to make it more likely that the children would be properly cared for at home?�
Do I need to address in these proceedings the issue of the possible
reintroduction of G into Y and Z�s lives, and perhaps X�s?� 

 

17����� As the threshold criteria pursuant to
Section 31 the Children Act have been dealt with, I have to apply Section 1
Children Act.� It is the children�s welfare which is my paramount
consideration.� I also have to consider the rights of each of the parents and
each of the children under the Human Rights Act.� In the context of this case I
am particularly concerned with the right to respect for private and family life
contained in Article 8 and the right to a fair trial contained in Article 6.� I
am satisfied that it is necessary to interfere with the rights of G in not
adjourning for what would be much of the next year for him to be assessed in
order to protect the rights and freedoms of the children.� I have had to
struggle throughout this hearing to ensure that the Article 6 rights of M and
the children have been protected, not an experience I can recall having had in
a care case before.� In this case unusually I have had to go back to that
fundamental principle of the children�s welfare being paramount throughout my
consideration of what the outcome of this case should be.� This is because the
presentation of the case by the local authority has been so flawed.� I have
reminded myself at every point that I must not let my frustration at the
inadequacy of the local authority�s conduct to mask what is best for the
children.� Similarly, the distress of M has been extreme and upsetting for all
to behold, but my focus must be on the children.� Finally on this theme, I am
well aware of the distress of X, the eldest child, who is desperate to go
home.� My role is to make decisions as to what is in each of the girls� best interests,
not to act out of sympathy alone.

 

18����� Turning somewhat belatedly now to the
evidence, the report by the Marigold dated 29th July is the crucial
document in this case because all the other assessments rely on it.� Yet it is
a deeply flawed report.� The report itself has many errors in its composition
so as to make its meaning incomprehensible at times or requiring the reader to
assume it means the opposite of what it says.� I am left with a report in which
the sense is unclear, which reduces the value of the report.� I am left with
the impression of a casual approach which reduces confidence in the substantive
work.� For example, when discussing M�s alcohol use � and there is no evidence
that M has an alcohol problem which would interfere with her ability to care
for the children � the writer of the report says: �JM has evidenced within
this assessment that she has been candid with the truth so it would be my view
that it would be difficult to ascertain how much alcohol M drinks as well as
how often.� �Even if I assume the writer means the opposite of what she
says, there is insufficient evidence in the report to support the statement
that M has not been candid.� I do not find that M has not been candid.� Her
evidence is not always easy to understand but that is a different matter.�
Another example, the writer says: �It is my view that M is not able to
prioritise her needs before those of her children.� �Think about it.� I
presume I am once again to interpret that as saying the opposite of what it
does say.� The main evidence given for that conclusion � if that is what it is
saying � in the report is M saying that she had to go to Country L for reasons
already set out, in October, so if the final hearing was in September she would
not be able to have the children back until her return.� I do not regard that
as M putting her own interests first.� The report is full of references to M�s
distress and how she cannot give her all to the children whilst feeling as she
does and showing such emotional distress.� The local authority had previously
refused to help her when she tried to go to Country L.� She needed to go
to Country L, and I accept her reasons for wanting to go.� I think she was
making a rational and sensible decision when saying the children would have to
remain in care until her return.� When M�s Probation Officer gave evidence, she
told me that M had never been late for an appointment with her and had not
missed one either.� Yet the Marigold report says: �M�s probation manager
told me that her life seemed to be somewhat chaotic, being late for
appointments etcetera.�� I do not know therefore why the report writer said
that.� The writer says in her introduction that she has liaised with M�s
Probation Officer.� If she has done she did so only at the very
beginning of her work because the Probation Officer Miss Ekwonobi told me quite
clearly that by August M had made much progress and had been reduced to medium
risk from high risk of causing her children harm.� She had made much progress
in her thinking skills.� None of this is referred to in the report and yet the
writer concludes when discussing the offence of which M was convicted that �It
is unlikely that her pattern of behaviour will change and she will continue to
put her own needs before those of her children.�� I do not agree with the
conclusions or the methodology of the writer.� 

 

19����� As I have mentioned, the report � to my mind
bizarrely � recommends adoption for the children aged nearly thirteen, five and
seven.� All three children wanted to come home and all three want to be
together.� The proposition that it was either in their interests to be adopted
or that it would be possible to find an adoptive family for these three girls
together � and there had been no sibling attachment work done by the Marigold �
is not remotely reasonable.� As Miss Young so succinctly said, the conclusion
fundamentally undermines the legitimacy of that assessment.� 

 

20����� I still do not know what the final
recommendations in the report mean.� What it says is this: 

 

��������� �I would respectfully ask that the
court considers care and placement orders for all three children to enable them
to experience safe nurturing and consistent care; that all three children are
placed together with carers that are able to reflect and celebrate their
cultural needs.� I would also recommend that contact takes place no more than
two times a year and that this is to be supervised.� However, should the court
be mindful to sanction and(sic) adoption order the matter of future contact
will need to be reconsidered in the light of this.� It is my view that Z and Y
would not be adversely effected(sic) should no face to face contact take place;
however, X, who is older and has more awareness of the negative experiences of
the past, would benefit from limited contact with her mother and older sister
S.�� 

 

��������� The writer�s recommendations for contact
are unclear as to whether they refer to those recommendations being under an
adoption order or what.� When Miss al-Fayad gave evidence she confirmed that
the report was true but did not first make any corrections.� Indeed it seemed
as if some, if not all, of the errors had not even been noticed by her either
when she signed the document or when she re-read the document � which she said
she had done, but I seriously doubt � prior to giving evidence.� 

 

21����� Perhaps of even more importance however in
my reaching the conclusion that the document is flawed is that there is no
consideration let alone analysis in the report of M�s background as a woman who
was raised to adulthood in Country L with a completely different approach to
parenting.� M�s experience of being parented was not discussed with her and
although Miss al-Fayad told me that cultural matters were discussed in planning
the assessment I was not at all convinced that anything more than lip service
was given to this issue.� It is notable that the only reference in the report
to different cultural practices is surprisingly to Vietnamese and Japanese
cultures.� In her evidence Miss al-Fayad said words to the effect that because
the children had been born and brought up in England she did not think that how
things were done in Africa were that important.� They are.� I have seen nothing
to satisfy me that anybody working on this assessment had any understanding at
all of M�s approach to parenting stemming from her own experience of being
parented or indeed of raising three daughters in Country L.� I have no memory
of judging a care case involving a family from Country L before, as I have
said, but I have judged plenty of cases about families from other parts of West
and Central Africa, and I am well aware that there are very different ideas
about parenting in each of the different countries of Africa from our own
ideas.� I am not of course suggesting that these three British children should
be parented in this country according to the ethos of Country L if it does not
accord with their needs.� What I am saying is that a failure to take
into account these important matters makes me have serious doubts about the
value of the work done by the Marigold.� The assessment was aware that M came
to this country having been forced to flee from Country L leaving behind three
of her children, two of whom had died as adults in the period leading up to
these proceedings.� I know that M secured some counselling but I believe that
was quite recently.� The loss of her children and her inability to find out
exactly why this had happened, to visit their graves or to satisfy herself that
the third daughter was all right, have been very major issues for M.� It would
have been appropriate in my view for the Marigold to have assessed what support
had been available for M to deal with all that, and what support should could
have in the future to make it possible for her to move on and to parent her
children well.� That is absent from the report.� 

 

22����� I conclude that the report on this family by
the Marigold is not one upon which I can rely nor importantly is it a report
upon which any other professional can rely as the basis for their own work.� It
was of great concern to me that when the current social worker Miss Brown was
asked about the Marigold assessment report she could not point to anything
wrong with it.� She said it was a thorough assessment and there was no concern
at all about it.� In my judgment that is such an inadequate description of this
assessment that it makes me more cautious about the evidence given by Miss
Brown herself.� I can see that she is a hardworking social worker who has come
late to the case and has had a difficult job in preparing her final evidence to
be filed some five weeks later.� However, contrary to what she has said under
cross-examination, I do not think she has sufficiently applied her own mind to
the issues in this case but has accepted the assessment of others.� She has
after all only seen the children for 50 minutes with their mother.� She too
showed a worrying lack of understanding of the cultural aspect of this case.�
She told me that to deal with it she consulted an African social worker but it
turned out that this social worker came from Zimbabwe.� Miss Brown clearly saw
nothing wrong with this because the worker was African.� As I said yesterday,
the distance between Zimbabwe and Country L is the same as from Chelmsford to Kiev.� I doubt that Miss Brown would think it appropriate to obtain guidance
from a Ukrainian as to how English cultural matters should be approached.�
Similarly, she told me that she had arranged for an African foster mother to
advise the current foster mother about cultural matters.� She is
well-intentioned but she was unable to tell me where that mentor came from and
just repeated �Well, she�s African.�� I thought I had made it clear in the
first days of this case that being culturally appropriate did not mean finding
somebody who is black, yet yesterday it emerged that the local authority
considered that the father should be assessed by someone who was culturally
appropriate and when I asked � with a sense of some foreboding � what the
ethnicity of that person was, I was told that that person again was from
Zimbabwe.� Clearly this local authority needs to look seriously at its
diversity training.� 

 

23����� Miss Brown also included information from
M�s Probation Officer without putting it into context, by which I mean that the
information applied at the start of Miss Ekwonobi�s work with the mother only
and that the situation had been very different from as long ago as August.� It
appears to me that Miss Brown has not assessed M afresh after the bulk of the
work done by the Probation Officer or importantly after M�s return from Country
L in the autumn.� Miss Young again has pointed out that there has been no
social work with the mother, and that appears to be the case.

 

24����� I turn now to the � I hesitate to call it
evidence � but I turn now to what emerged from the adjournment on Day 3 and the
trawl by Miss Brown and Miss Kelleher of Social Services files.� It appears
that the school made some reference to Social Care in January 2012 because of
something said by Z when Z was three and a half.� She referred to her mother
tying her up.� The note found from the school is confusing as it is not at all
clear who made the note or indeed who had the conversation with the child.� The
records shown that Social Care did make a home visit and spoke to the mother
and the children soon after but no note is made about how that particular
allegation was dealt with.� The little girls do mention something which appears
to be the same incident in August 2013 to their foster carer.� They also
mention being smacked and it hurting.� The context was that the foster carer
had first spoken of tying them together to stop them running away.� X made it
clear it was not something of concern and had not been proper tying up but done
loosely as part of teaching Z something.� M gives a very similar account to
X�s.� The younger children did not repeat any of this to Miss Brown when she
visited them last week, nor did X, but she was too distressed at yet further
questions for the social worker to be able to continue questioning her.� I conclude
that the social worker in February 2012 did his investigations and did not
consider this allegation to be a matter of concern but he then failed
adequately to make a recording; that the social worker in August 2013 failed to
act appropriately on receipt of information.� I make no findings about the
incident and consider that a great deal of time has been wasted for no good
reason.

 

25����� Looking at the work done or not done in this
case I am not able to place sufficient confidence in the judgment of the social
worker to rely on her recommendations to the court and this is not something I
say lightly.� 

 

26����� Dr Willemsen provided a report but was not
called to give evidence.� He is an expert with much experience and one I
respect.� He saw the children on 9th August and on that day spoke
with the foster carer, who appears to have given him information not seen
elsewhere in the papers in the form of a note or notes.� His report finds that
the younger two girls do not seem to have a strong bond with their mother.� He
concentrates on X, who he is worried about.�� The main reasons for his concern
� and in my view for some of his conclusions � are what the foster mother told
him, that X wrote down that she would like to be white and otherwise
different.� The foster mother also appears to have told him that X is scared of
her mother.� I do not think that that information comes from any other source.�
I cannot understand why the local authority did not pick up that documents were
being referred to which were not in the papers or why the foster carer, who I
am told is experienced, thought it appropriate to introduce documents in this
way � or indeed why an experienced expert thought it appropriate to take them
into account, certainly without exhibiting them.� I cannot rely on conclusions
reached in this way and certainly do not find that X is afraid of her mother,
an assertion which appears to be based either on something the foster carer
told the doctor or on something the foster carer showed the doctor.� As far as
I know, Dr Willemsen was completely unaware of M�s great progress under her
probation order, in part because the previous social worker�s statement did not
include that information but did include out of date information.� 

 

27����� Dr Willemsen provided an addendum in
response to questions put on behalf of M.� He was asked why he did not observe
contact between the mother and the children and his answers show that much of
his thought was guided by the assessment done by the Marigold.� As I do not
consider that that report is a fair or accurate report, it has to mean that Dr
Willemsen�s report is of less use and relevance than otherwise.� It is unclear
to me what Dr Willemsen�s conclusion is as to where these children should live,
and again I agree with Miss Young that he does not appear to rule the mother
out.� I do not think that Dr Willemsen was in a position to reach conclusions
about the children�s attachment although he perhaps had sufficient information
to raise questions about it.� As for his concerns about X, it appears to me
that there has been insufficient consideration of the possibility � in my mind
a probability � that X�s sense of guilt and poor self-image has developed since
her removal from home and was not present before.� There is no evidence from
the school to suggest there were such problems before; indeed the only evidence
from the school appears to be that Z and X have recently shown behavioural
problems which did not exist before.� 

 

28����� I am also not convinced in this case that X
would be emotionally harmed if the girls returned home and she continued to
play a part in caring for her younger siblings.� In many families in this
country that is exactly what has always happened and always will happen.� It
may not be ideal but I do not consider it to be emotionally abusive, amounting
to significant harm �� not for this child of this age of this background.� 

 

29����� M�s Probation Officer Miss Ekwonobi
impressed me greatly.� She has done a great deal with work with M and covered
many of the issues in her work which the court wished were covered with parents
in care cases routinely.� She is very positive about M and considers she has
made great progress.� There has been a communication problem no doubt between
Miss Ekwonobi and Social Care which has resulted in Miss Brown including in her
report information from Probation which is very out of date as well as some of
the more recent and positive information.� Miss Ekwonobi acknowledged that she
has not met the children but she is confident in her own skills and her risk
assessment.� I remind myself that the social worker has only seen the mother
with the children for 50 minutes during contact, and Dr Willemsen not at all.�
I regard the evidence of the Probation Officer to be very important.� In effect
she tells me that M has not only the capacity to change but has achieved change
and that change now needs to be tested as the children are returned to her
care.� She had no reason to think that alcohol was a current problem for M or
that there was domestic violence in her life.� Unlike the approach of the
Marigold or indeed the social worker, she based her assessment on evidence not
on conjecture on these areas.� For the avoidance of doubt, I make no findings
as to domestic violence or alcohol being a current issue as there is no
evidence.� I find Miss Ekwonobi�s evidence wholly credible.� She has approached
her work with independence and commitment and knowledge and not with
preconceived ideas.� Indeed I regard it as the best evidence I have about this
mother�s abilities.

 

30����� Dr Oyabodi is the psychiatrist who did not
give oral evidence but examined the mother and found her to be mentally well
but having suffered understandable depression in the past arising from the loss
of her daughters.

 

31����� M gave evidence on 25th March and
then again on 8th and 9th April.� One matter which became
clear immediately was that M�s English is limited.� She can express herself,
although not as a person born here would do.� But her understanding is
imperfect.� She did not understand the questions put to her on many occasions
except in broad terms.� She certainly did not understand nuances or when
questions were asked with an assumption in the introduction to a question that
her answer needed to deal with the assumption as well.� Her accent was not
always easy to understand.� More worrying to me was that it was apparent that
most of the advocates did not appreciate that she did not understand them.� I
think it is very likely therefore that the other professionals who have worked
with her have also not been aware of her limited understanding, save of course
for the Probation Officer, who has worked with her every week and therefore
will have been able to establish good communication.� I have serious misgivings
about her various conversations with the social workers and others in this case
as I do not think that these limitations have been sufficiently taken into
consideration, if at all.� An example is the first statement in these
proceedings by the social worker Nick Pratt, who says it is understood from the
current foster carer of the three children that she supervised telephone
contact that took place on 18th March 2013 � I note, two days after
the children�s removal � the mother reportedly advised Y �I am going to leave
you there forever� to which the child replied �Okay.�� M denied it and I do not
believe that this conversation took place for one moment.� 

 

32����� It is the case that M has not just left the
children once but at least three times.� This is wholly unacceptable and she is
fortunate that nothing bad has happened to her children on those occasions.��
She must not go away from this court thinking that I do not take a very dim
view of what she did, and I do not accept that she was let down by others on
three occasions.� She acted without regard to her children�s safety and put her
own wish to have a night out before their needs.� She has also smacked the
children too hard, and in the future that must not happen; there must be no
smacking.� The children have suffered as a result. �It must have been very
frightening for the children first to find themselves on their own as it got
dark and then to be removed by the police.� However, thanks to the work of the
Probation Officer I find that M has developed an understanding of why what she
did in March last year was so wrong and dangerous.� I find she has some
understanding of the criticisms of her emotional care of the children.� She has
the capacity to change and she can work with professionals.� M has sought help
and has had bereavement counselling and has attended parenting classes.� She is
criticised for not meeting the children�s emotional needs consistently.� The
Marigold say she shows emotional warmth but it is not consistent.� That may be
so, but in my judgment this is a decreasing problem.� The reading of the recent
contact notes � and I presume I am not the only one to have read them � showed
change.� M is focusing on the children consistently through more of the recent
contacts and no concerns are raised about any of the issues I have heard
about.� I do not know why this has not been drawn to my attention.� With help I
find that M�s consistency in providing emotional warmth will continue to
improve.� It is notable that X says in her own evidence that things have
improved in her mother�s life.� 

 

33����� M deeply loves her children, she is
committed to them, and I reject any suggestion that she is not.� Her double
bereavement has been a terrible thing for her and because she has such negative
support available to her she has not been able to shield the children from such
distress.� Three things arise from this.� Firstly, time has passed and she is
no longer so raw.� Secondly, she has now been to Country L, as she needed to
do, and I find that that has helped her to move on.�� Thirdly, I reject the
suggestion that the younger children should not be exposed to their mother�s
grief.� I am not saying that the children should be repeatedly subjected to
outbursts of very strong emotion by their mother, but I am saying that death
and grief is part of life and the children should have some experience of this
as it is their sisters who have died.� M needs help in the future with ensuring
that the children are not over-exposed to her grief but it appears to me that
she has made considerable progress since being to Country L.

 

34����� I have said only today that I am not going
to make any findings about G�s evidence.� He has been at too much of a
disadvantage and so indeed have the advocates.�� Mr Elcombe rightly did not
feel in a position to ask any questions of him.� I note that G professes to
have good reason for not having seen his children for four and a half years;
that he denies all domestic violence and that he has a very negative view of
M.� I also note on the face of it there is a discrepancy between him saying
that he has a clear CRB check but also that he has a conviction for breach of a
non-molestation injunction.� These are matters for the future.�� It is agreed
that his wish to have contact will be looked at first by way of a risk
assessment. �I make no findings about the piece of paper which G produced which
he says was written by X in 2009; first, because I can make no finding as to
whether or not it is X�s writing.� M says it is not.� It does not appear to me
to be the same but I do not know.� Secondly, because I have no idea � nor does
anybody else in this room � and no independent evidence as to how this piece of
paper came to be written.� I think it is necessary in this particular case to
give an example of what I mean.� In school books which mother kindly gave me
there is a passage in a book from October 2012 which reads: 

 

��������� �Tara is having panic attacks and is
beginning to make herself ill and her mother notices and is very concerned.��


 

��������� I know that X did not at that time know
Tara, the foster mother, which shows that context is important.� Similarly, the
school work goes on to say: 

 

��������� �Mum can no longer bear to see her
daughter in pain and agony so she goes to the school and tells them to find out
what is going on.� A teacher talks to Tara and explains that everything is
going to be okay.� The next thing that happened is the police is involved and
finds out that Roxanna and Ronnie are behind all the mischief and are taken
away.� Tara, she becomes a competent musician.�� 

 

��������� I hope that illustrates the point that it
would be a grave error to put any weight on this piece of paper.� 

 

35����� X did not give evidence but I have read her
statement and read much about her.� She sounds like a very special young
person.� She must be very distressed by what has happened to her, especially by
the prolonged separation from her mother, whom she is desperate to be with, the
fact that she was told she was to be adopted and the fact that she has been
told she will only see her mother for 16 hours a year.� I cannot see how any
professional in this case considers that this care plan meets this child�s
needs.� I reject any suggestion that this young person only wants to be with
her mother out of guilt or fear, and I specifically reject any suggestion in Dr
Willemsen�s report that X is frightened of her mother.� There is no evidence
for this.�� Dr Willemsen has, as I think I have said, been too casual in his
approach to evidence and to making conclusions in this case.� 

 

36����� The guardian does not advocate the children
going home and thinks they will be emotionally significantly harmed if they do
go home.� This is not part of the threshold document and I do not find that to
be proven.� The guardian relies to a great extent on the work of the Marigold
and of Dr Willemsen.� I have said all I have to say about those reports.� Her
own independent work is limited.� I am well aware that CAFCASS does not allow
much independent work these days; however I needed more in this case.� The
guardian has not spoken with the mother save before or after contact.�
Apparently the mother did not keep the one appointment she was given in the
last year.� She has not spoken with the mother�s Probation Officer.� She has
only observed two sessions of contact and I do not accept that that is sufficient
to make conclusions in this case about the attachment of their children to
their mother or the likelihood of them experiencing significant emotional
harm.� I am pleased that the guardian did some research into the culture of
Country L.� However, I do not consider that she has the expertise to advise me
about the differing approaches to parenting between this country and what
happens in Country L in such matters as the custom of showing affection or not
to children and what is considered reasonable chastisement in Country L.� I
would have needed to see the source material to rely on her interpretation of
what she was told.� I do not think the guardian has taken proper account of the
children�s strong feelings in this case and I also do not think her support for
the local authority plan for contact is supported by the evidence.� What I
needed from the guardian in this case, where there have been so many social
workers and inadequate work by the local authority, was more application of her
independent mind and expertise.� I needed her to assess for herself the impact
of the work of the Probation Officer on the mother, to ensure that any deficits
in the mother�s approach to contact were subject of proper work and follow-up,
and to ascertain whether the visit to Country L did have the benefits on the
mother�s emotional wellbeing and consequent availability for the children
emotionally which M hoped they would.� I did not get this and I do not agree
with the guardian�s recommendations.� 

 

37����� Many of the points made in Miss Hardy�s
submissions which she kindly put in writing are ones which in my judgment
cannot be sustained when one takes into account M�s poor English, and do not in
my mind properly reflect the evidence.� She says for example that after 14
years here M should have adapted to Western practice about abandonment and
chastisement.�� Chastisement is not part of this case.� I have made no findings
about this, although M accepts she smacks her children and I have told her that
is to stop, and it is my finding that M has now so adapted, but only because
she has now received assistance to do so from her Probation Officer.

 

38����� I turn now to Section 1 Children Act; the
child�s welfare shall be the court�s paramount consideration.� In Re B
Lord Justice Macfarlane said that a court hearing such a case as this needed to
look at the welfare of each of the children in a global and holistic way.� He
also said that the court had to make sure that any orders made were
proportionate.� When deciding whether these three children or any of them
should remain in care or be cared for by their mother, I must take a step back
from the detail of the evidential points which have been argued out in front of
me.� When I do this in this case I come to the conclusion that the proposals of
the local authority are not proportionate and that the welfare of the children
would best be met in the care of their mother.� My consideration of the welfare
checklist has been key to this conclusion.� 

 

39����� Their wishes and feelings.� There is no dispute
amongst the parties that each of the children wishes to return to live with
their mother and despite what is no doubt a more comfortable year with the
well-supported and experienced foster mother for X the wish is desperate.� She
cannot contemplate the sort of contact arrangement which the local authority
has in mind for her.� The most recent contact show how much the children want
to go home and I do not think that the professionals in this case have fully
understood why.� What does not seem to be recognised by the social worker, the
guardian, the Marigold or Dr Willemsen is that the children and their mother
love each other very much and want to be together.� The proposals of the local
authority that to start with the younger two children should see their mother
for 12 hours a year and X for 16 hours completely ignores these children�s
wishes and feelings.� X was hugely distressed at this idea.� The care plan is
dated January and established that X needed time with her mother on her own.�
We are now in April.�� Nothing has happened.�� I do not have confidence that
contact will grow in any meaningful way under the LAC process if the starting
point so ignores what the children want and clearly need.

 

40����� Turning to their needs, it is not in doubt
that M is able to meet the children�s physical and educational needs.� The
children have not come to the attention of any agency as a result of physical
or educational neglect other than being abandoned.� They were doing well at
school, where their attendance and punctuality was always excellent.� I am told
that the home environment is now excellent.� It is of note, as I have said,
that Z and X are for the first time in recent weeks not doing so well at
school.�� This has been put down by the social worker as evidence of them
acting out now they feel safe.� I do not agree.� I do not think there is
sufficient evidence to conclude this.� The fact that their school performance
has deteriorated and their behaviour has deteriorated from how it was when they
lived with their mother is more likely to be linked to their change of
circumstances and their wish to be at home.� Clearly the children�s physical
safety would again be compromised if M repeated her actions of March 2013.�
However, I am satisfied on the basis of the impressive evidence of Miss
Ekwonobi that this is not likely to happen again.� I also accept what M says
that she realises how big a mistake this was and she has repeatedly assured me
it will not happen again.� 

 

41����� The real issue is whether the children�s
emotional needs can be met by their mother.� I agree that there are aspects of
the mother�s parenting which do not fully meet the children�s emotional needs.�
She needs further work to ensure that X does not parent the children in her
place although I have said I do not consider it harmful for any of the children
if X assists her mother.� I find that M has understood the need to change this
area of parenting and has been trying in contact to act differently.� M needs
to improve her relationships with the younger two children and reassure X that
X is not responsible for how she, M, feels.� However, in my judgment the
emotional care given by this mother is good enough.� It is not the role of the
State to take children off parents unless it is absolutely necessary to do so
and the fact that other carers may meet the children�s emotional needs better
is not sufficient reason.� As Mr Justice Hedley said in Re L in 2007: 

 

��������� �Society must be willing to tolerate
very diverse standards of parenting including the eccentric, the barely
adequate and the inconsistent.� It follows too that children will inevitably
have both very different experiences of parenting and very unequal consequences
flowing from it.� It means that some children will experience disadvantage and
harm while others flourish in atmospheres of loving security and emotional
stability.� These are the consequences of our fallible humanity and it is not
the provenance of the State to spare children all the consequences of defective
parenting.� In any event it simply could not be done.�� 

 

��������� I also factor in what I have learned of
X�s current emotional distress and the fact that since removal from home she
has developed problems about her self-image and guilt.� There is no evidence
she had these before.� In my judgment M can meet the emotional needs
sufficiently.� 

 

42����� If the children stay in foster care their
physical needs will be met.� It may be their educational needs will be met.�
But that very much depends on the children not being moved around, and I also
have to bear in mind that children in care do not generally achieve well
educationally.� These children appear to have the potential to achieve well and
in my view their best chances of educational achievement will be with their
mother.� If I was to make care orders there is no guarantee that Z and Y will
spend their childhood with this foster carer.� They have many years of
childhood ahead of them.� 

 

43����� Looking at the likely effect of change in
the circumstances, these children have been away from their mother for a year
and the transition back to her care should be done with care.� Fortunately, it
appears that the foster mother and M can work together and a sensible plan
needs to be developed to rehabilitate the girls home.� In my judgment on
balance the effect of returning the children to their mother provided there is
sufficient support in place will be to their benefit.� If they stay in care
there will be a drastic reduction in contact from twice a week to a few hours a
year and in my judgment that would be very damaging for these children in
particular X.

 

44����� Turning to their particular characteristics,
in my judgment these children�s identity needs will not be met in care.� I have
mentioned my previous role in London.� Since coming to Essex I have noted of
course there is a very different ethnic make-up of the population and hence the
children who are subject to care proceedings.� What I did not expect however
was that the agencies involved with such children were so ill-informed and
unready to address issues arising in cases where the children are from
different ethnic groups.� It is not good enough for the social workers to shrug
and say that the foster mother�s mentor is African when asked twice by me which
country she is from.� The children are losing their ability to speak or
understand their mother�s mother tongue for reasons I do not understand.� There
is strong evidence that X no longer has pride in her colour or ethnicity; she
wishes she had a lighter skin.� I have no confidence at all that the children�s
identity needs will be met if they remain in their current placement.� It is
unfortunately the case that black children generally do not do well in the care
system and where their ethnicity is not properly recognised the outcome is
likely to be worse.� 

 

45����� Any harm they are at risk of suffering?� The
risk of future harm with their mother is two-fold.� Whether she will neglect
the children by repeating her behaviours, I have already addressed this and I
find that it is more likely that she has learned and changed sufficiently.�
Secondly, the risk to the children�s emotional needs including X not being used
as a carer.� M has learned in part from her sessions with Miss Ekwonobi about
such issues and the contact notes show positive change.� Again I repeat it is a
matter of balance.� It may be that X will continue to have a role in caring for
the younger two and I have said I do not consider that to be so emotionally
harmful to justify care orders and separation from their mother.� I am
satisfied that such caring will not be at the expense of X�s education which
the mother clearly values highly, as we know from the history of her elder
girls.� In any event, this is an area which can be worked on when the girls are
at home.

 

46����� The risk of harm if the girls remain in care
is also present; all the factors I have already set out, from unhappiness to
loss of identity to insecure placements.� They have had three social workers at
least in their first year of care.� I presume the frequent changes will continue.�


 

47����� The capability of their parents to meet
their needs?� I have set out that I do not have confidence in the work of the
Marigold.� I do have confidence in the work of Miss Ekwonobi.� This mother has
the ability to provide good enough parenting to each of the girls.� The
presentation of each of the girls at the time they were received into care does
not support a thesis of poor parenting.� I have insufficient information to
make any conclusions about G.

 

48����� My range of powers?� I consider that the appropriate
order here is a one year supervision order to R and I will ask R to prepare
such a care plan.� It must set out the support which will be given to the
family.�� I am very aware that until the beginning of June Miss Ekwonobi will
be working with M on a weekly basis and she has said that she will be able to
go to M�s home and see her with the children.� The local authority must liaise
with Miss Ekwonobi and plan to take over her work at the end of M�s order.� I
do not mean going in every week but replicating some of the support and
advice.� 

 

49����� Section 1 Children Act also refers to delay
being likely to prejudice the welfare of the child.� In this case there has
been very serious delay and I am unclear as to how and why that has happened.�
The fact that a relation came forward at a late stage to be assessed and then
pulled out is not sufficient reason.� There has been no sense of urgency.� Even
when it was identified in December that a final hearing was needed it was not
listed for 16 weeks.� During this time the behaviour of the children has
deteriorated and X has become increasingly upset.� If it is true that the
advocates were told in December that the first slot available was in late March
they should have contacted the DFJ and in any other case I hope that they will
do so.� 

 

50����� Section 1 also says that the court should
not make an order unless it considers that doing so would be better for the
child than making no order.� This in my mind is linked to the question of
proportionality.� In Re B Lord Neuberger said: 

 

��������� �It is clear that a judge cannot
properly decide that a care order should be made in such circumstances unless�
the order is proportionate bearing in mind the requirements of Article 8.� It
appears to me that given that the judge concluded that the Section 31(2)
threshold was crossed he should only have made a care order if he had been
satisfied that it was necessary to do so in order to protect the interests of
the child.� By �necessary� I mean, to use Lady Hale�s phrase, where nothing else
will do.�� 

 

��������� Making a care order would not be better
for these children than not making a care order.� Making a care order with a
care plan of long-term fostering with very limited contact would not be a
proportionate response to the issues which started off these proceedings or
indeed to those which emerged during the proceedings.� Care orders are not
necessary and they would be disproportionate.� 

 

51����� What is necessary is for these
children to go home and for the family to receive proper support which will
include either X continuing with her psychotherapy and the younger two having
play therapy or possibly family therapy.� The work of the Probation Officer has
to be continued by support from Social Services.� I was never told what work
was done by the support worker, which makes me doubt that there was much.� It
seems in this case an experienced support worker could be of assistance to go
into the home to assist M with the aspects of emotional care which have been
identified as problematic in this case.� M also needs to be pointed to where
she could perhaps get a support network of friends and others so that she never
finds herself in this position again.� So for all these reasons I make the
supervision order and the children will return to live with their mother.�
There should be a phased return home and the mother�s views as to how this
should be done are to be given proper respect.� I do not know what has been
discussed but I would expect the children to be back home full-time by the
beginning of May.� In the meantime clearly supervision of contact stops, X is
to have contact on her own, and there is to be no attempt to undermine my
decision.� I would expect to receive a care plan detailing the work which will
be done under the supervision order and a rehabilitation plan by the end of
next week.

 

52����� Permission to use the transcript of today�s
judgment for the purposes of an application for public funding and in
connection with any consequent proceedings.

Introduction 
The court is once again concerned with A, who is a little more than 5 years and 10 months old and who was born on 19th March 2008.  He is the son of B and his former wife, C. 

 

The father, who is represented by Christopher Wood of Counsel, applies for a sole residence order in his favour.

 

The mother, who is represented by Leslie Samuels QC, makes application for permission to remove A to live with her and her family permanently in D.  

 

In determining these applications it is A's welfare that is the court's paramount consideration.  A is represented through his guardian, by Celia Graves of Counsel. 

 

This is effectively the final welfare hearing in relation to A the court having already carried out a lengthy fact finding hearing which culminated in a judgment of 30th July 2013.  In that judgment the court determined that the allegations made against the father that he had sexually abused A were not true but the mother had honestly believed the abuse allegations to be true.  The nature of that "evolving belief" involved her questioning of A which effectively contributed to his continuing but erroneous disclosures.  

 

The court gave the mother an opportunity to come to terms with the judgment given her honest but mistaken belief in relation to A's abuse and highlighted the risk to A if the mother was not able to deal with the findings of the court and promote contact with the father in a proper way.

 

In any event the court found that A had been significantly harmed in the form of emotional abuse as a consequence of the high levels of conflict between the parents.  Additionally the court made some observations of the father in relation to his litigation conduct and it is against the background of that judgment, and those findings of fact that this welfare hearing is determined.

 

The court expressed concerns regarding the mother's presentation in the witness box and her emotional and psychological fragility.  That issue coupled with the need to identify as to whether the mother had been able to come to terms with the judgment led to the instruction of Dr Wear, consultant psychiatrist, whose evidence I shall come to presently.  

 

The court also made extensive orders in relation to contact and A has been enjoying generous and extensive contact with his father for the past six months or so. 

 


Dr Alan Wear is a consultant psychiatrist and medical director at Southampton Priory Hospital where he has been for the last sixteen years.  He is a jointly appointed expert in this case and has extensive experience in preparing court reports as well as an active clinical practice.  

 

He was asked to deal with the mother's psychological and psychiatric presentation by reference to a series of agreed questions following the court's fact finding judgment in July of 2013.

 

I shall deal with those questions in turn and his replies.

 

He was asked whether, in view of the mother's belief that A has been sexually abused by his father as to whether, and if so to what extent, the mother now accepts the court's findings that father has not sexually abused A.

 

He has recorded that mother appears to accept the findings of the court and explained in oral evidence as to how mother has rationalised the events by on the one hand saying that she could not "unhear" what she has heard (in terms of A's disclosures) but has recognised pragmatically that her insistence that he had been abused in the teeth of a full forensic analysis of all the evidence, would have an adverse emotional impact on A.  He explained that the mother's pragmatic acceptance was part of a process and she had moved on by the time he saw her in October 2013.  He was alive to the fact that internally the mother may have different thoughts about her allegation but her acceptance had a face of validity even though there may not have been explicit acceptance that A had not been abused by his father.  The fact that her perception that A has been "more relaxed" since the court case may have assisted her in the continuum of her position and he acknowledged that the decision of the court had removed responsibility from her.

 

He was able to acknowledge that the reported problems by school in relation to A may not of course indicate that A himself is more relaxed but it is her perception of him that is important in terms of assessing her thought processes in relation to whether she still holds the belief that he has been sexually abused.

 

It is of course self evident that the mother may still maintain that belief but his assessment of her was that she was prepared to go along with the decision of the court.

 

He was taken to that section of his report when he recorded that mother had said in terms of the "allegations" that "they are behind me" and further, "if I did not accept the findings then it opens Pandora's Box."  She has said in terms of the court process "I think my child has now been heard" and this may be evidence of some internal dilemma but the process of internal questioning was normal in relation to many facets of life and there was a distinction between belief and pragmatic acceptance.

 

He has suggested in terms of the mother's previous conviction of the veracity of her five year old's allegations concerning his father that mother was "suggestible" and that should be viewed in the context of a dysfunctional relationship with the father and she "followed her heart."  This is explained by virtue of the fact that an individual is more receptive to ideas that may fit in with her own view of the world.  The mother's opinions have not "turned on a sixpence" but so far as he is concerned he perceived that mother felt that she had done her duty.

 

He accepted the proposition that if she was not able to accept the judgment then she had evidentially thought about the potential of emotional abuse to A.  There may be an element of pragmatism in that she risked losing A if she maintained the truth of the allegations but accepted the proposition that it was more the mother's recognition of damaging the child that she clearly loves as well of course her recognition that maintenance of the truth of the allegation could damage herself.

 

A significant feature emerged from his evidence that this was all part of a progression and he would expect to see her acceptance develop over time and by October he described the mother as being "more light on her feet."  He emphasised the importance of the mother's faith as part of her rehabilitation to deal with aspects beyond her control.

 

Accordingly in answer to the question as to whether the mother maintained the view that A had been sexually abused by his father and what impact that would have on her parenting, he recorded that it was his assessment that mother does not maintain that view for all the reasons that I have stated above but if she did, it would undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on the relationship between A and his father. 

 

Crucially in relation to this case he was also asked (and this was question 3) to provide an opinion on the mother with regard to contact hereafter between A and his father and her ability to promote this relationship and facilitate contact.

 

He recorded that mother appeared quite positive about A's relationship with B but and, in my judgment, herein lies a potential for conflict, she remains quite negative about B and her relationship with him believing as she does that there is no prospect for a healthy interaction between herself and B because, on the mother's view, the relationship becomes manipulative and produces conflict.  He noted that when the mother was talking about the father she felt very dejected.  Her view is that she had made a mistake in reigniting the relationship with the father and regretted it.  She had taken a pragmatic stance but discussion with the father leads to arguments.  I am bound to say that this does not bode well for A with whomsoever he should live and it has been a significant feature of this case that even the most basic childcare arrangements involving, for example, handovers at contact, have had to be micromanaged by the court.  

 

The relationship with the father was never going to be good and there was a risk, according to this expert, that small misunderstandings would be interpreted as a device to cause upset.  He indicated, and the court wholeheartedly agrees, that this must improve for the benefit of A and certainly A's recorded behaviour at school should be a call for joint concern and collaboration by the parents as there must be a substantial risk that A is an emotionally conflicted child.  In recording that she is able to ignore A if he says something about his father so that it does not detract from the relationship that A has with his father is a positive rather than a negative indicator and perhaps some insight that she has shown not to add credence to the type of bizarre disclosures that A was making historically.

 

In terms of the mother's mental health, he was asked to comment on her emotional and psychological presentation and fragility in the context of her belief that her child is being sexually abused by his father and the impact of the court findings.

 

He has recorded that the mother has had emotional and psychological difficulties in the past but even after reviewing the general practitioner notes which records her eating disorder, that there was nothing to suggest that the mother had mental difficulties or a personality disorder.  In fact he has described her as being "emotionally quite robust" in that she seems to have moved on from her position of certainty in relation to sexual abuse to one of looking forwards to the future and ignoring the events of the past.  

 

His view is that the mother remains psychologically vulnerable but was supported by her family and her membership of the Church of Latter Day Saints. 

 

He said in oral evidence that if she persisted in her view that the allegations were true this may well have attracted a psychiatric diagnosis. 

 

In the context of the mother's proposed application to relocate to D, his views are best expressed in his very recent letter of 13th January 2014 which in many ways is an echo of what he was saying in his report and I quote: "The contact that [C] wishes to promote between [A] and [B] was, at the time of my interview, positive and that she was not undermining the relationship between [B] and [A].  Her request to travel back to [D] with [A] must be seen in the context of what has gone before.  A decision to return to [D] (the opposite side of the world) would have some impact on the contact arrangements between [A] and his father.  Although this is a longstanding plan the end point of it would be inevitably to distance [A] from his father and interfere with contact between the two of them.  Whether conscious or unconscious it has to be seen as a wish to push her own needs (to live back in [D]) above those of [A's] relationship with his father."  In oral evidence he described this as a "self evident truth" as any move is bound to have an impact on contact.

 

Father's evidence
B is A's father and the author of a lengthy statement of 13th December 2013 in support of his application for a residence order in relation to A and in the event of that being unsuccessful, his clear opposition to the mother removing A from the jurisdiction to live permanently in D.

 

It was evident not only from his written evidence but also his oral evidence that he had enjoyed good quality unsupervised contact to A since August 2013 and his relationship with A, although always good, has clearly gone from strength to strength.  It was evident that the previous history in this case of his contact being frustrated coupled with the false allegations had caused him a great deal of apprehension in relation to the prospect of the mother moving with A to D and the erosion of his hard fought relationship with A, particularly due to the fact that he has felt that there was a lot of catching up to do.

 

He spoke with passion and conviction, and no little sensitivity, when describing the range of activities he now enjoys with A and the structure that he has provided for A during periods of contact.  It is substantially to his credit, and indeed the credit of the mother, that all went well when he cared for A during mother's trip to L in October.

 

In the event of A not moving with his mother to D and in the event that A either resides with him or resides with his mother, there is a clear agreement in relation to contact to the "non resident parent" based on broadly sensible arrangements of A spending alternate weekends with the non resident parent from Friday to Monday, additional time perhaps in the school holidays for the non resident parent, over and above an equal division of half of holidays.  

 

I draw a number of features from his written evidence.  He draws the court's attention to the evidence of Dr Berelowitz in relation to A's primary need to be in a close relationship with both his parents and to be free of discord.  He correctly identified that what in A's best interests is closely linked to the relationship between the mother and himself and in doing so acknowledges the court's criticisms of his own behaviour and previous shortcomings.

 

Rooted in his position is his view that the mother's attitude to him has not fundamentally changed since the court handed down its judgment and he is considerably concerned in relation to what he perceives as the mother's negative attitude to him and what he considers to be unsatisfactory communication in that the mother continues to appear to be unwilling to communicate directly with him.  Handovers continue to take place at neutral venues and he received his first text message from the mother after one and a half years, a short time before this hearing.

 

It does however seem to be common ground between himself and the mother that all has gone well so far as contact is concerned.  He is unhappy in relation to what the guardian has reported in relation to her investigations at school and which are set out in her report which, he says, goes to his concern that A needs stability and consistency and he is the person best placed to provide it.

 

It transpired that he has recorded some of A's words in a diary that he keeps contemporaneously.  He is clearly preoccupied, and I do not criticise him for this in view of the history, with some of the things that A has said although perhaps he should pay greater attention to Dr Berelowitz's remarks that whatever A says should be treated with a great deal of caution.

 

He has carefully set out in his statement A's various remarks on D, religion, family and, on one occasion, skin colour.  A seems to be under the impression that he was born in D although that is not the case and when the father has disagreed with him he has become upset.  He told his father that he was going to D for a year and he would always see his father on Fridays.  When he explained to him that it was too far A said that he would always see his father on Saturdays as it took only a day to get there.

 

He also speaks about religion and there was an occasion in October when he was driving A past the temple of the Church of the Latter Days Saints when B told A that he did not go to the temple and A became angry and threw a toy at him.  Incidentally it seems that B dealt with the matter most appropriately by distracting A and by talking about something else.  A has told his father and the father's mother that she is not his grandmother and that his grandmother is in D.  He has also said to have told his paternal grandmother that she had "ruined our life."

 

Although in his statement B indicates that he is wary of drawing any firm conclusions from what A has said or done it is clear that in reality he has been considerably concerned about what A has been saying and feels that A has become more sensitive to differences of nationality and religion, family and colour between the mother and himself and feels the need to emphasise those differences.  The father may or may not be right about that but what he is right about is that A continues to feel pulled between his parents who he loves and when the father makes that observation in his statement I agree with him.

 

He was asked by his Counsel that if he had to draw a circle to describe where he was in terms of A's view of him he said that he would not be in the inner circle of his mind.  This was an interesting revelation and, in my judgment, an accurate one.  Although I am sure that A loves his father he views him as someone who he interacts with but disapproves of his views on religion as his father is "a non member."  The father acknowledged that A did not match his perception of how a person should be and this perhaps is not assisted by the lack of direct communication between himself and the mother particularly at handover.  This resonates with other evidence in relation to how close A is to his mother and I was drawn increasingly to the view that A's emotional wellbeing is closely connected to that of his mother.

 

I am bound to say that, in my judgment, the father has done all he can at handovers to reinforce the importance of A's mother to him.  On one occasion he provided flowers for A to give to his mother and he is careful to make no adverse remarks about her in A's presence.  I believe him when he says this but it is deeply significant in this case that the father did not even know A's address and he is right when he says that it would be better for A if he could take A to his house and the mother could return A to the father's house and A could see his parents interacting with one another and know that his parents talk about him then that would be better for him.  I wholeheartedly agree and although the parties feel that they have made progress there is still more to do to prevent A developing into a further emotionally conflicted child.

 

His main objection to the mother's move to D is that it would hinder the frequency of his contact; he feared A's relationship with him would be lost or damaged even on the mother's proposals.  He said that he needed frequency to build on what Dr Berelowitz described as "a lovely relationship."  Telephone and Skype were a poor substitute for a child that does not speak for long on the telephone.  His written evidence indicates some considerable doubt in his mind that mother really has moved on from the judgment and the mother's continued negative view about him.  He says at one stage in his statement "� more importantly, [C's] attitude is inevitably picked up by [A] whether she expressly tells him what she thinks or not" and that this negative attitude towards him has not fundamentally changed.  He highlights the significant risk that that attitude will prejudice A's relationship with him and future contact which will be exacerbated if the mother is allowed to take A permanently to D.  

 

It is against that background that the removal application clearly fills him with distress and apprehension and he draws upon Dr Berelowitz's evidence that "relationships with a non resident parent struggles to avoid discord.  They also struggle to survive relocation.  A combination of severe discord and the furthest possible geographical location is likely to deal a fatal blow to [A's] relationship with his father."  

 

His statement raises other practical difficulties regarding visiting D related to his business although I observe that at least on paper he is open to the appointment of a manager to run some of his business interests in his absence in the event of a move.  At the root of his evidence is the fact that he has little confidence that his relationship with A will survive a permanent move to D.  I have little doubt that he could afford the cost of travel.

 

Cross examined by the mother's Counsel he was taken to the judgment and I am bound to say showed a good understanding of the criticisms made of him and the contribution that he has made to the toxic relationship between the parties.  He was challenged that he was anxious to deploy any weapon in the litigation.  However, in fairness to him, I acknowledge that he faced the most severe and serious of allegations namely sexually abusing his own son and faced the risk of imprisonment and losing his son forever.  Perhaps even worse: his son would grow up in an erroneous belief that he had been sexually abused by his own father and the damaging effect of that on him.  

 

He rightly derived the message from the judgment that the conflict caused damage.  He was worried and concerned about the future but clearly could not forget the damaging events of the past.

 

He was criticised that his statement continued to show that he was adversarial.  I do not agree.  His statement is a measured approach in which he seeks to deploy what arguments he can against the emotionally devastating consequences of his child being located to the other side of the world.  However I do accept that there was nothing positive about the mother in his statement although he was able to acknowledge in oral evidence that she was a loving parent but nevertheless maintained his application for a change of residence centering as he did on her lack of ability to promote him in a positive way and the need for A to have stability and consistency by not moving.

 

Although acknowledging that A's politeness, good manners, kindness, ability to share and a good sense of humour must in some way be attributable to the parenting that he has received from the mother, he was concerned also that A was emotionally hurt and a little confused and a product of the discord.

 

It was evident that he felt that it was the mother who had exposed him to emotional damage by taking him to a Refuge, involving the police in handovers, obstructing contact, changing schools and forming a negative view of him.  Although he acknowledged that he had a part to play in all of this by alleging that the mother had a personality disorder (which he now regrets), it was clear that he was anxious that past events may predict future ones to his and A's disadvantage.  

 

He was taken again to his perception of A's view of him which he continued to describe as 'not inclusive' and he thought that he would be in a better position as the residential parent to promote the mother's relationship with A.  He did not think that there would be much by way of substantial reaction from A in relation to a change of residence something that I found very difficult to reconcile with the evidence that he gave in relation to A's view of him and where he stood "outside the circle". 

 

He acknowledged that A's love for him was there but said "it is not in his mind.  I am not included" and he clearly bases this on the things that A has said particularly as he does not see A accepting or celebrating the differences between his parents and described A as intolerant of him.  He may well be right.  It was Dr Berelowitz who reported in his assessment of A that A was positive about his mother in 'deed and word' and that emotional closeness and connection between A and his primary carer was identified by the guardian who reports "[A] loves his mother very much and cannot envisage living without her."  She goes on to say "however [A] is building a close bond with [B] and says he "likes going to daddy and daddy does fun stuff."  It is unsurprising that the guardian recommends no change of residence given what she perceives to be A's relationship with his mother which, if anything, is supported by B's view of A's attitude to him and where he stands "outside the circle".

 

B presented in a more nuanced and child centred way when he gave his evidence than he had done in July of last year.  He is understandably devastated at the prospect of A moving to D and its potential for damaging his hard fought relationship with his son who he dearly loves.  Many of his observations were child centred and his anxiety understandable in this complex and finely balanced case.  I acknowledge that A would be the loser without an enduring relationship with such a devoted father and I therefore examined the mother's evidence with care to assess her capability to maintain that positive relationship at distance.

 


Mother's evidence
C is A's mother and she has filed statements of 18th November 2013 and 7th January 2014 respectively in support of her applications to retain residence of A and to take him to live permanently in D.

 

So far as the practical arrangements related to such a move are concerned, they have been advanced in so far as they possibly can be to await any formal consideration by the court.  The plan would be for her to live with her parents in M which is an area in which a large number of members of the maternal family live.  I understand for example that A has no less than twenty-nine first cousins who visit the maternal grandparents regularly.  A local state school has been identified and the mother has been impressed with their programme which has a good reputation locally and also has a programme that deals with integrating children with emotional concerns adopting a holistic approach.  She liked the extra curricula activities offered including music and the school is located in the centre of M.  Having said that she is open to any suggestion of father's in relation to private education but clearly her own funds do not permit this particularly as what resources she has had seem to have been depleted by the lengthy and acrimonious litigation between the parties. 

 

She sets out her contact proposals in her second statement making it clear as she did in her oral evidence that they are only proposals and that she would be alive to more extensive contact.  In short form what is offered on paper in any event is that the father should have contact during periods of school holiday in D and she would be happy for A to travel to England for contact with the father during his long school holidays in December/January.  She made it plain in oral evidence that that was merely by way of proposal and as a starting point and would welcome additional contact if the father was able to travel to D so that he could be involved in staying locally and taking A to and from school.

 

Central to the issue of mother's application to remove A from the jurisdiction has been the extent to which she has been able to accept the judgment of the court.  

 

In her November statement she says "in July 2013 I was in a highly emotional and exhausted state.  In the preceding twelve months I had felt lost, alone and overwhelmed by my fear that [A] had been sexually abused.  I had moved house, lived in a Refuge for victims of domestic violence and felt engulfed by the legal process."  She went on to say that by the conclusion of the fact finding hearing she was prepared for the possibility that the court may find that the father had not sexually abused A and explained how she needed time to process that long judgment.  I have of course the benefit of Dr Wear's evidence and the mother has explained in her oral evidence that she was prepared to accept the findings explaining that it was part of a process to understand the findings and to understand the implications for A of not accepting it.  She has come to realise that the judgment has involved a better result "anyway" for A.  She explained the process by which she came to be "at peace" and understand that he was safe and sound in his father's care and things had not occurred.  

 

It is a significant feature in the chronology of this case that she was comfortable when she left A in father's care for two weeks in October when she went to L.  She said more than once in her evidence that she would not have been able to do that had she believed that the judgment was wrong.  I accept her evidence in that respect and I note the process and the time that she needed to arrive at that particular stage.  I accept that if the mother had thought that A was in anyway at risk she would not have gone.

 

It seems that the trip to L, which I understand involved involvement with her church, was a refreshing one and she was able to draw a line under what had happened and go through a process involving both her mind and heart which she described as "an evolving process" to the extent that she was able to tell me in the witness box that she did not believe that A was abused by his father or that he would be unsafe with him.

 

She has learnt to handle some of the "odd things" that A says in terms of attaching weight to them.

 

She acknowledged in her evidence that A needs to have a meaningful relationship with the father and showed some understanding of the father's fears particularly in light of the appalling history in this case.  She told the court that she valued the father's relationship with A and wished to encourage and facilitate it and indicated a desire to be flexible over and above what she had indicated in her written proposals so far as contact was concerned in the event of her being given permission to remove A from the jurisdiction. 

 

Although she recognised, after helpful questions from the guardian, the limitations in relation to Skype she was optimistic that it could still be creative.

 

She has been considerably reassured and heartened by A's good relationship with his father and the way that he has been excited to see his father and apparently chatted quite comfortably about the things that they have done together.  She said in terms "father does a good job" and has been pleased to see father's involvement in A's homework by way of example.  

 

It is the guardian who, in her report, catalogues various concerns from the school.  In so far as A has spoken positively to the school about "fun times" with his father she said that she was pleased to see this.  There are however a number of concerning observations made by school related to A's "poor concentration" and being in "a bubble of his own," not knowing whether he was coming or going, his occasional aggression particularly his aggression towards his mother and, if I may say so, suggestions that A may have been late for school and brought by mother or deposited when unwell.  I should say I attribute less weight to these later suggestions having heard the mother's explanation but what I was drawn to was the teacher's reported observation "[A] cannot continue as things are due to the impact on him emotionally."

 

In broad terms, C has accepted the concerns in relation to A and agreed that he had been aggressive to her saying that he didn't love her and he was angry with her and there is little doubt that A has been displaying behavioural difficulties and was not making progress because of his emotional needs as reported by the school.  The only matter that I can draw from this is the judgment that I had already given in relation to this case and the finding that A will inevitably have been damaged by the acrimonious relationship between his parents and I suggest that that will be acted out for some considerable time and I am bound to say that the lack of direct communication between the parents must be a contributing factor in relation to that however many small positive steps may have been made.  The father in this case has reported various rather upsetting and strange things that A has said although at the same time in his statement acknowledging that there may be some difficulty in attaching a great deal of weight to them particularly given the history of this matter.

 

He has remarked to his father about the difference in skin colour and the mother recalls a similar conversation with A saying that the top of his arm was like his father's and the underside of his arm was like his mother and it is plain that mother did not draw anything particularly sinister from that and did not think that A was unduly concerned.

 

He has of course lost time in attending the local church and a network of his friends there and that may or may not be an explanation in relation to his apparent hostility to his father about being a member of the same church.  I am bound to say that C did not appear to be dogmatic about her chosen faith accepting that A would form his own views as indeed have members of her family.  He goes to a Catholic school and teaches his mother the way they say prayers at that school and she was open to the notion that A will inevitably have different ideas and different experiences.

 

From her own standpoint her religion has helped her to accept the judgment and help her to "move forward and bounce back with a positive attitude."

 

She was criticised for having in effect led an internationally itinerant lifestyle since she was 17 and left D.  She said with some force that no matter where she has been in the world she has always returned periodically to D and that is where she regards her home to be.  She accepted that she had travelled a lot before she was a mother and she wants to go home to build something solid and it is clear that she identifies with D and with her family and with being from D and she wants A to have that experience.  She felt "hopeful" about going home.

 

At being compelled to remain here in the jurisdiction of this court she became upset.  She said she felt "not so hopeful" making it plain as she did to the guardian that she would not leave A.  

 

While having been in this country she felt like a round peg in a square hole and her time in England has been based on someone that she is not.  Her marriage did not work.  She was here because of a marriage that she is no longer a part of.

 

She has longed to be part of her very large family and would like A to experience that. 

 

In making her application she expressed the wish for an amicable relationship with the father.  She would agree to mirror orders in a court in D to give some security to contact if it was required.  After all that has happened she identified a need in A for him to have a happy childhood as indeed she had done.  She was clear that too much had been lost emotionally as well as financially in this case.

 

Perhaps unsurprisingly given the history of this tragic case she was challenged comprehensively on her plans by the father's Counsel.  If her application is to succeed it will have an inevitable effect on the father's hard fought gains in relation to his relationship with A and she showed some understanding of the father's fear and the real fear that she identified as him not having his son in his life.

 

She was challenged that she still really had a negative attitude in relation to the father and that there were pragmatic and expedient reasons for her to say that she accepted the judgment.  She showed some understanding how the father may still be upset about the allegations that had been made.

 

In her latest statement she said that she felt that the relationship between her and the father was at risk of deteriorating as the result of the adversarial nature of the court process saying "it is hard not to have felt almost constantly under attack". She explained in oral evidence that every time she came to court her differences in the past were highlighted and explained the destructive nature of having to keep going to court.

 

She was open to the suggestion that the father was entitled to disagree with her and challenge her reasons for moving but I am bound to say the litigation has been relentless and gone on for a very long time.

 

It was suggested that she has always had a negative view of the father and that was demonstrated from observations that she made in the hospital shortly after A's birth and the obstacles that have been placed in the way of contact.  She was resistant to the notion that she would deploy any argument to frustrate or stop contact.  It seems that her early concerns were related to the fact that A was a very young baby and later of course her situation in relation to contact was totally subsumed by the allegations of sexual abuse.  

 

There may well be some force in the case that in the past she has frustrated contact and taken steps to distance herself from the father, evidenced by her reluctance to use a communication book at contact, disclose her address until she did so in court and, of course, she had been prepared to accept unconditionally the allegations of sexual abuse.

 

There is little doubt as I found in my judgment of July that the mother has had in the past a poor opinion of the father and an underlying negative attitude but I accept her evidence that she does not now have a negative view.  Her views have evolved and been shaped by events since July. I accept her evidence that she understands the real need for A to have a relationship with his father.

 

As part of the process of "distancing herself from the father" it was suggested that her move to D was in real terms more of the same and part of her fortress mentality.  I am however fully persuaded that she viewed "going home" as a positive for A and herself and not as a means of distancing herself from the father particularly now, as matters are so much improved.

 

I should however record that although both parties report small steps in communication the position is still lamentable with contact handovers taking place at neutral venues sometimes in the presence of third parties.  That of course speaks volumes to this intelligent and emotionally vulnerable little boy and it seems that there has only been limited exchanges by text in relation to practical arrangements by contact and those in the course of the last few weeks.

 

It was being clearly suggested that this tiny progress in relation to better communication was extremely fragile against the background of her proposed application to live on the other side of the world and it is a sorry indictment of this case that matters are still organised between lawyers although I note the more recent positives.

 

There is an echo of that perhaps in what she said to Dr Wear when she was discussing the relationship with the father she indicated that it was easier if there was no direct contact between them because it only induces conflict and as a consequence it was Dr Wear who reported subsequently that the mother was quite negative about B and his relationship with him believing as she did at that time that there was no prospect for healthy interaction between herself and the father because the relationship "becomes manipulative and produces conflict".  This of course does not bode well for A wheresoever he should live.

 

However I was impressed by the mother's open determination to improve matters and although acknowledging that they were not going to escape discord, there was scope for the relationship to improve; it needs to.  

 

It was suggested in cross examination that until she went into the witness box her acceptance that the allegations are unfounded seems to have been qualified.  Dr Wear reports that the mother "appears" to have accepted the findings and there is a suggestion that she has "parked the allegations" as it would "open Pandora's Box."

 

Even to the guardian she said that she was not wrong for speaking up for A and accepts "if she got it wrong."  There is an element of qualification in relation to what she said.  It was suggested that as she was keen at the time to establish the truth it may well be that her acceptance was borne out of pragmatism or expediency in the context of wanting her application to succeed.

 

However the mother made it clear in terms that she did get it wrong and I am fully persuaded that this continuation of the process has resulted in the view that she expressed in the witness box, which I accept.

 

As to moving to D, she once again reiterated that her attempt to build a life in England had not been a success for some time.  I agree it has not been.

 

She was challenged that she had described A getting "more relaxed" in the context of what has been reported by the school in relation to his behaviour and she clarified that by saying that she meant that A was more relaxed about going to see his father and was keen to spend time with him.

 

She accepted that A would have a positive view about going to D which she had discussed with him before the July judgment.  She has been careful not to do since then because she didn't want to build him up in case the application failed.  I accept her evidence.  In relation to A's hostile attitude to his father at not being a member of the same church, she could offer no explanation as to why A was upset with his father nor indeed why he should have picked up that the father should not have been his father or that the paternal grandmother was not a member of his family.  She clearly found it encouraging that A does talk positively about his father and I accept that she derives satisfaction from it.

 

She was challenged in relation to going to D that it was part of her case in the ancillary relief proceedings that she was going to stay in this country, go to university and her housing needs were identified as such.  She had said in those proceedings that she required sufficient provision to visit D once a year and that was in May 2011.

 

Her feeling subsequently is that she has never felt more isolated and although the church was a support it was no substitute for her family.  I believe her when she says that.

 

She was asked what she would do if her application to go to D failed.  She was without doubt filled with sadness at the prospect as indeed was the father at the prospect of A going to D and said "I will have to find something to grasp onto".  She would experience feelings of isolation and sadness, knowing that A could be part of many things in D.  I am mindful that she told the guardian that she did not know how she could build her life here.    In my judgment there is little doubt that the destructive effect of continual proceedings has taken its toll and her describing the court proceedings as "going on and on". She told the court that things "hadn't worked out" notwithstanding the fact that her family have scrimped and saved to come to this country to support her in these proceedings.  It was suggested to her that her decision to move to N was on the basis that there she would feel safe and secure.  She agreed that that was her motivation but that she misses home and she said that many things had changed. 

 

She was challenged that there was no need for the move to take place now and she reiterated that she wanted to achieve a happier existence for all and A would gain if his parents were happy.

 

In view of Dr Berelowitz's observation about the need for A to have a close relationship with both of his parents, she observed that A is not going to be a six year old boy for ever and there were more possibilities in the future and showed some understanding of the pressure on the relationship with the father over the prospect of a lengthy geographical separation.  She promised the court that she would foster the relationship and denied any suggestion that she was running away from a relationship with the father.

 

She was challenged that her application lacked detail but said, quite rightly, there would be more detail if she got permission.  It was not difficult to rent a home.  It was not difficult to put A in school and the plan initially was to stay with her parents.  I accept that her stance is the correct one.

 

She reiterated more than once in her evidence that she would do all that she could to promote A's contact with his father.

 

At the conclusion of her evidence I was left with the impression that she had an overwhelming emotional need to return to her homeland and saw clear benefits for her son in many respects if she was able to do so.  I have little doubt in agreeing with Dr Wear that the mother remains psychologically vulnerable and, in my judgment, a refusal would have devastating consequences for her if she was compelled to remain here indefinitely as I am fully persuaded she would never leave A.  She would be devoid of hope and this would impact adversely on A for reasons that I amplify later in this judgment.

 

Guardian's evidence
A's guardian has filed three reports in the proceedings as a whole and it is her last report of 15th January of this year that deals with the applications that the court is currently grappling with namely change of residence and an application to remove from the jurisdiction.  I record that the guardian listened to most of the evidence and when she came to give her live evidence her position remained the same as it was when she wrote her report namely that there was no justification for a change of residence to the father but she could make no recommendation either way in relation to the application to remove.  

 

Dealing with the residence issue, she told the court in oral evidence that it was not in A's interests for residence to be changed to his father.  She has had regard to the fact that mother has always been A's main carer.  The relationship is good and he is close to his mother to the extent that when she returned from L in October A asked his mother "don't you love me."  In fact, in my judgment, it is that very closeness of the relationship between A and his mother, the fact that she is inside the circle and B is outside the circle that is a striking feature of this case and chimes with Dr Berelowitz's observation that "A has an overwhelmingly positive attitude to his mother in deed and in word."  

 

Regarding the remaining application for permission to remove from the jurisdiction, although she remained undecided she was able to accept a number of matters raised by both the mother and the father's Counsel.  She agreed that historically obstacles have been put in the way of A's relationship with the father and lack of communication still played a part.  There was still a question mark in her mind as to whether or not the mother accepted the judgment and she remained sceptical.   She was concerned that the distance to D and the problems in the parties' communication may have an effect on the green shoots of progress in relation to contact and clearly thought it significant that court orders have played a role in achieving progress.  

 

On the other hand she said that at least there had been an opportunity for the parties to listen to each other in court and this was a positive.

 

She agreed that mother had no doubt as to the truth of her allegations prior to the July hearing and by way of comparison on 9th January 2014 when she saw the mother she had no doubt as to the merits of her application to move to D.  She agreed that mother's history of a negative attitude to the father, her suggestibility and her strong protective instinct coupled with her black and white views could reoccur.  She agreed that the combination of discord between the parties and distance may cause difficulties in the father's relationship with A but would not agree that it was impossible for it to be maintained.  

 

On the other hand central to her concerns in relation to a refusal decision is how the mother will cope.  The mother reported to her that she didn't know how she would build a life here.

 

She was prepared to acknowledge that things had improved and she had not presented any obstacles to contact since July and there was evidence of her letting go by virtue of her trip to L in October and leaving A with his father. 

 

Conflict had by no means disappeared with the mother only giving her address in the witness box and the father presenting as very emotional in the witness box in relation to what he had been through and the fact that he was wary and anxious.  I am satisfied that this guardian has correctly identified the main competing features in relation to this complex case but what emerges from her report is the very close bond and emotional connection that A has with his mother.  She reports "[A] loves his mother very much and cannot envisage living without her."  Against that background I do have to of course consider the consequences of refusal on the mother and the knock-on effect on A. 

 

The guardian agreed with the observation by A's school that things could not continue as they were and there was a prospect of the process of litigation continuing for the next eight to twelve years if the mother was compelled to remain with both parents in a state of uncertainty.  The guardian reposed some concern that A would be caught up in the middle.  I took heart from that part of her evidence notwithstanding the balanced nature of her concern which indicated that the mother had demonstrated greater acceptance of A having a relationship with the father.  Having seen her in the witness box I would have said that it goes further than that and that she fully realises its importance and its potential damage to A if it is not maintained.

 

She agreed with the court that mirror orders in D would be important.  On the mother's proposals A would have the opportunity of seeing his father face to face every three months or so but she quite rightly pointed out that it would need positive reinforcement between those visits and was clearly alive to the risk of contact not being maintained and the long term emotional effect that could have on A.

 

She saw little point in putting off the decision. 

 


The Legal Framework
There is no dispute as to the law and I have drawn on the careful summary prepared by the mother's legal team which sets out the relevant principles.

 

Both applications are governed, primarily, by the paramountcy principle and the welfare checklist set out at s.1 Children Act 1989.

 

There has been intense debate as to the principles to be applied in relocation cases and whether those principles are different depending upon the factual circumstances in the UK.  Guidance is now to be found in the case of Re F (Relocation) [2012] EWCA Civ 1364 [2013] 1 FLR 645 where the Court of Appeal (including Munby LJ as he then was) held:

 
(1)	There could be no presumptions in a case governed by s 1 of the Children Act 1989. From beginning to end the child's welfare was paramount and the evaluation of where the child's best interests truly lay was to be determined having regard to the 'welfare checklist' in s 1(3).
(2)	Cases should not become 'bogged down' with arguments about whether this was 'a Payne case' or a 'Re Y case'. The last thing that this difficult area of family law requires is satellite jurisprudence generating an ever-more detailed classification of supposedly different types of relocation case. Any move in that direction is to be firmly resisted as is the temptation to try to force the facts of a particular case within some forensic straightjacket.
(3)	Even where the case is not one made by a primary carer, the judge is entitled to have regard to Thorpe LJ's 'discipline' as set out at paragraph 40 of Payne.

At paragraph 26 of Payne v Payne [2001] EWCA Civ 166, [2001] Fam 473 Thorpe LJ made the common sense point that "(b) refusing the primary carer's reasonable proposals for the relocation of her family life is likely to impact detrimentally on the welfare of her dependent children. Therefore her application to relocate will be granted unless the court concludes that it is incompatible with the welfare of the children." At paragraph 32 he said "Thus in most relocation cases the most crucial assessment and finding for the judge is likely to be the effect of the refusal of the application on the mother's future psychological and emotional stability."

 

At paragraph 40 Thorpe LJ said:

 
"However there is a danger that if the regard which the court pays to the reasonable proposals of the primary carer were elevated into a legal presumption then there would be an obvious risk of the breach of the respondent's rights not only under Art 8 but also his rights under Art 6 to a fair trial. To guard against the risk of too perfunctory an investigation resulting from too ready an assumption that the mother's proposals are necessarily compatible with the child's welfare I would suggest the following discipline as a prelude to conclusion:
(a)	Pose the question: is the mother's application genuine in the sense that it is not motivated by some selfish desire to exclude the father from the child's life? Then ask is the mother's application realistic, by which I mean founded on practical proposals both well researched and investigated? If the application fails either of these tests refusal will inevitably follow.
(b)	If however the application passes these tests then there must be a careful appraisal of the father's opposition: is it motivated by genuine concern for the future of the child's welfare or is it driven by some ulterior motive? What would be the extent o the detriment to him and his future relationship with the child were the application granted? To what extent would that be offset by extension of the child's relationships with the maternal family and homeland?
(c)	What would be the impact on the mother, either as a single parent or as a new wife, of a refusal of her realistic proposal?
(d)	The outcome of the second and third appraisals must then be brought into an overriding review of the child's welfare as the paramount consideration, directed by the statutory checklist insofar as appropriate."

He added at [40]:

 
"In suggesting such a discipline I would not wish to be thought to have diminished the importance that this court has consistently attached to the emotional and psychological well-being of the primary carer. In any evaluation of the welfare of the child as a paramount consideration great weight must be given to this factor."

I have summarised above the submissions of law I have received from the mother's Counsel which of course are broadly helpful but less there be any doubt I am clear in relation to the distinction between legal principle and guidance.  The dicta in Payne v Payne is of course guidance but it is the welfare decision by reference to the Welfare Checklist that is the central consideration however valuable the guidance of the kind provided in Payne v Payne.

 

I am equally clear in terms of the two applications I have to consider that the other authorities to which I have been referred make it plain that it is the application for residence that I should consider first before considering the application for permission to remove accepting as I do that the evidence in relation to both applications overlap.

 

Conclusion and findings
This has been a complex and difficult case.  That much is self evident from the reading of my earlier judgment on the issue of the unfounded allegations of sexual abuse against the father.  The personalities in this case are complex and the history of litigation extensive and a decision either way on the mother's central application for permission to remove has potentially devastating consequences for both parents and A. 

 

I have listened to live evidence from both the mother and father and the guardian.  I have read opening and closing notes from the parties' Counsel.

 

I deal firstly with the application for residence.  I do so with the considerations of the Welfare Checklist under s.1(3) of the Children Act firmly in mind.  I accept the evidence of the guardian that there is no justification for a change of residence.  The mother has provided consistently good care in relation to A and there is no cogent evidence that I am prepared to accept that this regime should be changed.  A looks to his mother as his primary care giver and she meets all his physical, emotional and educational needs and a change in his circumstances would, in my judgment, have an adverse effect on him given his close connection with his mother.

 

I have little doubt that the father has the capability to provide good enough care in relation to A who he loves very much but a central issue in relation to this case is how A regards his mother and there is little doubt that she is absolutely central to his emotional needs and emotional wellbeing.  In the words of the guardian, "A loves his mother very much and cannot envisage living without her."  She reports that A is building a close bond with B and although A likes going to daddy and doing "fun stuff" I am entirely persuaded that the mother is absolutely central to his emotional equilibrium.  I refuse the application to change residence.

 

I turn now to the central issue of the mother's application to go to D.  The mother's application was lodged some considerable time ago and was before the court during the July hearing and the central concern of the court at the conclusion of that hearing was the mother's ability to accept the judgment that the father had not sexually abused A.

 

It has been suggested at length by father's Counsel that mother's acceptance of the judgment has been for reasons for pragmatism and expediency only.  It is suggested that she still holds negative attitudes towards the father which will sabotage the green shoots of A's growing relationship with his father in the event of a move as evidenced by the numerous obstacles that she has placed in the way of contact prior to the July decision.  There is a real issue therefore in the mind of the father that the mother continues to harbour a negative attitude towards him and has not internally accepted the judgment of the court and in order to bolster her application for permission to leave has conveniently distanced herself from the findings.

 

In relation to the mother's change of attitude since the judgment, I have had the benefit of the evidence of Dr Wear and I accept what he has had to say regarding the process of change.  Even if there has been a pragmatic acceptance of the court's conclusions my assessment of the mother in the witness box was that she has gone beyond that in that she has recognised the risk of potential damage to A in the process of acceptance and the consequences for him of non-acceptance.  She is prepared to accept that she "got it wrong" and this is evidenced by her having not produced any obstacles to contact albeit under a court orchestrated regime, and even to the extent of allowing the father to care for A during a period in October when she was out of the country for two weeks.  In assessing the mother's evidence I am satisfied that she is being truthful when describing the process through which she has come and I could detect no guile or artifice in relation to what she says.

 

A more difficult aspect has been her historical negative attitude to the father.  There is little doubt that she has placed obstacles in the way of contact in the past and may indeed still not see him in an entirely positive light.  However I was impressed by her commitment to future contact and her recognition of the importance of A's relationship with his father.  This mother has been criticised in the past for acting with her heart instead of her head but I am persuaded that she spoke from the heart when offering a commitment to promote future contact in the event of a successful application to relocate.

 

There is some criticism in relation to her plans that they have not been well thought through and fully considered so far as schooling and accommodation is concerned and her choice of future career.  I am satisfied however that her plans are as developed as they can be pending permission of the court to relocate in July.  Apparently there is little difficulty in enrolling in a state school in M.  One has been identified of which she has received good reports.  Her plan to stay initially with A's maternal grandparents is a sound one until she can establish herself in rented accommodation which I accept is freely available.  As to her own career, then perhaps it is understandable that she may wish to see her son settled before finessing her own plans.  She has made broad proposals for contact but these of course need consideration by the father in relation to any counter proposals and I fully accept that it was difficult for him to focus on that particular issue given that the outcome of the mother's application was still at large. 

 

I have to take into consideration a broad range of factual issues in relation to this case which taken individually are of course not determinative in such a finely balanced decision, but which taken together tip the balance in favour of removal.

 

A core issue in the case would be the effect of refusal on the mother's psychological state and how this may impact on her care of A.  I fully accept the submission that the impact need not be as high as causing mother some psychological or mental illness but there is little doubt that there would be a profound effect on her emotional state and I judge that by not only her statement but also by her presentation in the witness box and by the observation of the guardian who says "if removal from the jurisdiction was not granted this would inevitably cause [C] stress which could impact negatively on [A]�"  I do not accept the submission that the mother is a robust individual.  Dr Wear described her as "vulnerable" and in my assessment of her throughout a number of days of evidence both in relation to the fact finding hearing and this latest hearing, I found her to be emotionally vulnerable and isolated.  The prospect of her in effect not being able to return to her country of origin and the support of her family would be devastating.  Her evidence indicates that she does not know what to do to start to build a life in this country but would of course remain for A's sake.  The effect on A of his residential parent undergoing such distress cannot be underestimated.  He is not a robust little boy as reports from school indicate.  He is emotionally troubled.  Furthermore he is "wired", if I can use that clumsy expression, and directly emotionally connected to his mother.  Demoralisation, distress and sense of isolation, and hopelessness, would affect him of that I have no doubt.

 

The other side of the balancing exercise I have firmly in mind is the effect of removal on his burgeoning relationship with his father and must consider whether it was capable of withstanding lengthy separation bearing in mind his very young age.   I also appreciate the devastating consequences for B.  I was impressed by his evidence.  He is a thoughtful and reflective man and can bring an enormous number of benefits to A by virtue of his relationship with him, not least being his rich heritage.  He is clearly sensitive to A's needs and has done extremely well to make up for lost time in recovering his relationship with his son.  He is to be congratulated for his sensitivity and determination.  However painful however it will be for him to read this judgment it remains a fact in this case that A is, for the reasons I have articulated, more closely emotionally connected to his mother.  She is the residential parent.  It is her ups and downs that will affect him most profoundly and there is a great risk that mother's loss of hope will have an adverse effect on her parenting of him.  There are many benefits for A in relation to a move to D notwithstanding the potential for loss of some relationship with father. 

 

However B is a man of some means and no little determination.  He at least has the financial opportunity to travel to D to keep in touch with his son.  A will not be six years old for very long.  As the years advance the opportunities for travel grow.  I am entirely persuaded however that if the mother has misled me regarding her expressions of good intention in relation to the need to promote positive contact (and this will be necessary particularly between visits) that the relationship will wither on the vine.  It is her responsibility to ensure that that does not happen and it is a grave responsibility.  Should it happen she would have failed her son in a shameful and unacceptable way.  It is her responsibility.

 

I am driven, as I have said, by the Welfare Checklist.  I deal with the considerations under s.1(3) in turn:

 

In so far as A has any ascertainable wishes, he wishes to go to D although I fully understand that he has no real concept of what that means or the likely effect of the loss of relationship with his father.  There is little doubt however that he wishes to be with his mother and have fun times with his father.  He loves both his parents.

 

In terms of his physical, emotional and educational needs, I am satisfied that either parent could meet his basic care needs and his educational needs would be met whether he is in D or in this country.  However for reasons I have explained there is a close emotional connection to his mother.

 

There will be an effect on him in relation to his change of circumstances.  He will lose the regularity and close contact with his father.   This will be a loss for him set against the benefits that will accrue if his mother returns to her homeland and achieves peace and stability and family support.

 

A is a six year old British boy with an father from E and a mother from D.  His dual heritage will become increasingly important to him. 

 

I have already identified that A has suffered significant harm as a consequence of being caught up in the toxic relationship between his parents.  There is a risk that this will continue unless the parents improve communication and the mother continues to promote the father as a positive figure.  There is however a substantial risk that he will suffer harm if his mother's application does not succeed because it will impact on her care of him if her life here becomes devoid of hope as I believe it will do if she is deprived of an opportunity to return to her homeland with her son.  

 

As I have said, each of his parents are capable of meeting his needs but it is his mother that is the most capable of providing his emotional needs as evidenced by the closeness of their relationship.

 

In this case the guardian felt unable to make a recommendation.  The issues are finely balanced but for the reasons that I have articulated, A's welfare requires that the balance falls in favour of removal as I accept the mother's evidence that she has effectively no reason to remain in this country.  I do not believe that the mother's application is a cynical attempt to distance herself from the father.  I believe that it is heartfelt and genuine and arises out of a genuine need of her own.  The application is therefore granted.  

 

Having allowed the application to proceed there are issues that are yet to be resolved.  A is not permitted to leave the jurisdiction unless until there are agreed mirror orders lodged in the family court in D.  Much work needs to be done in relation to a contact regime which should be set out in an order.  This order should include adequate provision for indirect contact.  The order should contain a preamble setting out the mother's recognition of the need to promote a positive relationship between A and his father for the duration of his childhood.

 

Above all, once the parties have come to terms with the impact of this judgment, which should be sooner rather than later, the lines of communication should now ease so that the parties can work cooperatively for their son's benefit.  The proof of that I suggest is in relation to what I see as the final stage in these proceedings namely agreeing the terms of contact.

 

This judgment I know will have a devastating impact on B.  However if he is half the man I hope he is, he will rise to this new challenge in the thoughtful and determined way I have seen him demonstrate in the witness box.  A deserves no less.

JUDGMENT








HER HONOUR JUDGE STAITE

 

1       
The court is concerned with the present and future welfare of six children
namely A (aged 12 years), B (aged 9 years), C (aged 8 years), D (aged 6 years),
E (aged 3 years) and F (4 months). All six children have the same mother (the
Mother). A�s father was named on A�s birth certificate, but has played no part
in his upbringing. B and E and have the same father, but he has played no part
in these proceedings. D and C have the same father, but likewise he has played
no part in these proceedings. Indeed, with the exception of F�s father none of
the other fathers have played any part in these contested public law
proceedings. 

2       
Until the first day of the final hearing (17th March 2014), F�s
father was indicating that he wished to provide long term care for his
daughter, F, in the event that the mother could not care for her.� His position
changed when he learned that an initial viability assessment of his aunt (�the
aunt�),� had been positive and that Thurrock Borough Council (�the local
authority�) were seeking a more detailed connected person�s assessment to
assess her ability to care for F on a long term basis. As all parties agreed,
in the light of this further assessment, that the future care and placement
options for F could not be determined at the hearing in March 2014, a further
hearing was listed in May 2014 for the court to consider F�s long term welfare
needs. 

3       
For her part, the mother made it clear that she sought to care for F on
a long term basis. She accepted that there should be an adjournment of any
final orders pending the connected person�s assessment of the aunt. However, her
position was that the court should order a supplemental report as to her parenting
capacity from the psychologist who had been appointed by the court (Dr Dawn
Bailham) which would assist the court, at a further hearing, in clarifying
those changes which the mother said she had made since the children were
received into care and which would (on her case) enable her to care for F in
the foreseeable future.� The local authority�s position in relation to F was
that the mother had not made sufficient changes to be able to offer a safe home
for F in the future and that if the further assessment of the aunt was not
positive, then, in the absence of any other family member to care for her, the
local authority would seek to place F for adoption. The local authority
(supported by the guardian) did not support any further assessment of the
mother at this stage of the proceedings.








4       
Since the children were received into the care of the local authority in
April 2013, the two oldest children have lived continuously with their maternal
grandfather and his partner, the childrens� step-maternal grandmother. In late
October 2013, B joined her brothers in her grandfather�s home. A viability
assessment undertaken in relation to the maternal grandfather and his partner in
advance of B being placed in their home with her brothers, identified many very
positive features of the care which they gave (and have continued to give) to
the boys. This included the very good relationships, which individually they
had with the children, their ability to prioritise the needs of the children
and to provide them with consistent, committed and loving care. I really commend
the maternal grandfather and his partner for all they have done for the
children in their care. Having seen the maternal grandfather in court
throughout the final hearing -and having asked him to speak to me directly- I
know that his commitment to the future welfare of the children is completely genuine
and well rooted. The eldest three children are, in my judgment, exceedingly
fortunate that they can remain with their grandfather and his partner in a safe
and secure home on a long-term basis. 

5       
I note that the grandfather and his partner may not, for financial
reasons, be able to consider being assessed as Special Guardians for the three
children. They have been advised that issues of financial support and other
support, which the children may need in the future may be more readily
available if the children remain looked-after children. I completely respect
their position in this regard. Their stance in relation to special guardianship
(which would of course give them parental responsibility for the three
children) should not, in the particular circumstances of this case, pose any
threat or challenge to their long term care of the children. In my judgment,
the essential issue is their willingness and ability to provide a long term
home for these young children in a sibling group and in my judgment if is not,
in those circumstances, crucial for them to have parental responsibility for
the children. With the number of children who have been placed in their care, I
urge the local authority to be responsive to requests for appropriate financial
assistance and other support from the grandfather and his partner in future
years as the needs of the children as they grow older will inevitably make them
more expensive to maintain.

6       
The local authority�s final care plan in relation to the three oldest
children is therefore that they should remain in the care of the grandfather
and his partner under a full care order.� Although the mother would dearly wish
to care for the children, she recognised at the outset of the final hearing
that her father and his partner were providing excellent care for the children
and that the children were thriving in their care.� Although there was an outstanding
issue about contact between the mother and the three oldest children at the
start of the final hearing, this was resolved by the mother conceding that her
current twice weekly contact to the children should be reduced to 4 hours of supervised
contact on a fortnightly basis, a proposal which was expressly endorsed by the
childrens� guardian. As a result of this agreement at court, final care orders
were drafted by counsel for the local authority in relation to the eldest three
children.

7       
Following these arrangements made at court on 17th March 2014,
the substantive contested issue between the parties related to the long term
placement of D (aged 6) and E (aged 4). These children have been in foster care
since October 2013 after their removal from a family placement with the
maternal grandmother. The local authority�s final care plan is for them to be
placed with long-term foster carers and for them to have supervised contact to
the mother. The mother does not support the placement of D and E in long term
foster care. She seeks to care for them either in the immediate future or
following further assessment of her capacity to care for them, which would
reflect, on the mother�s case, the huge strides which she has made in meeting
any previous deficiencies in her parenting. The mother believes that the
programmes she has undertaken since the children were removed from her care have
enabled her to see where things went wrong in the past. She believes that, as
the children�s mother, she should be caring for them and, moreover, that she
can now care for them appropriately. The guardian supports the placement of D
and E with long term foster carers and she does not support the mother�s
application that there should be any further assessment of the mother either in
relation to her care of D and E or in relation to her capacity to care for F.

8       
For the final hearing, the court heard evidence from (a) the current social
worker in the case for the four oldest children, (b) the social worker for F (c)
the previous social worker for the oldest three children and author of a
parenting assessment of the mother (d) the court appointed psychologist, Dr
Dawn Bailham (e) the mother and (f) the guardian.

9       
The background to the case. During the period 2004-2010 various
referrals were made to social care about the mother�s rough treatment of A and
various domestic violence incidents between the mother and the father of B and E,
including some physical abuse of A by him. There were concerns that the mother
placed herself in violent relationships with unsuitable men and prioritised these
relationships over the safety of her children.

10    On 26th
May 2011, A advised a teacher at school that his mother had hit him around the
face and on his back. The mother had earlier that day told the head teacher
that A had been off school because he had fallen off his bike and had hurt
himself. The mother subsequently admitted hitting A when she was angry. 

11    On 19th
March 2013, there was an anonymous referral to social services during which the
caller expressed concerns that the mother was not caring for the children
adequately and was leaving the children in the care of inappropriate young
teenagers five days a week. It transpired that one of these teenagers was
subject to Child Protection Plans. When the mother was contacted about these
arrangements she said that she would no longer leave the children with the
adolescents concerned.

12    On 23rd
April 2013, B disclosed that a 15 year old male babysitter had kissed and
cuddled her and had put his fingers in her nonie (vagina) and that it had hurt.
She also said that the babysitter had kissed D (which D later confirmed). �B
disclosed this to her mother and to her friend. Only after the friend had
raised the matter did the mother decide to report the matter to the police. The
mother said that she had had her suspicions, but she agreed that she had continued
to leave B in the care of the teenager after B�s disclosure in order �to try
and catch him in the act�.� On 24th April 2013 B maintained her
account of sexual abuse during an ABE interview. 

13    All the children
were removed from the mother after these disclosures and placed with the
maternal grandparents in separate placements under a family arrangement. 

14    The local authority
then commissioned a report from a chartered clinical psychologist, Dr Dawn Bailham,
who was instructed to undertake a full psychological assessment of the mother
including a cognitive assessment. She was asked, specifically, to comment on
the mother�s ability to understand and accept the local authority�s concerns
and to consider the mother�s ability to safeguard the children and meet their
needs until adulthood.� Additionally, she was asked to comment on the mother�s
ability to implement changes and sustain those changes and whether such changes
were within the childrens� timescales. 

15    Dr Bailham saw
the mother on 16th August 2013. At the time she was pregnant with F.
Dr Bailham described the mother as having immature reasoning skills and
egocentric focusing on her perspective of the situation. Although she became
upset when talking about the children and wanting them returned to her care, she
showed little emotion and demonstrated little empathy when she was asked about
the sexual abuse of B. She accepted, however, that she had made some rash
decisions about previous relationships which had had negative consequences for
her children. 

16    In her summary
of conclusions, Dr Bailham said that the mother was a woman with low
self-esteem who had difficulty with verbal and social reasoning skills. She
tended to focus on her own needs while neglecting the needs of her children.
She continued to find herself in relationships with men who presented a risk to
the children and she lacked any insight into these risks, appearing to be
unwilling to recognise them and to make necessary changes to her life style. Dr
Bailham doubted that the mother had separated from F�s father at the time of
the interview, a view also shared by the social worker, who had advised Dr Bailham
that a probation worker working with F�s father had told Childrens� Services
that they continued to be in a relationship and had only said they were
separated because they wanted the children back. The social worker had also
told Dr Bailham of a more recent disclosure by B that F�s father had hit her with
a spatula over the hand. B had also told the social worker that she did not want
contact with her father because he used to hurt her all the time. 

17    Dr Bailham said
in her report that the mother would benefit from having individual work about
the effects of sexual abuse on children and would also benefit from
psychotherapy to assist her in understanding why she had made past relationship
choices and how these had put her children at risk. At paragraph 9.7 of her
report, Dr Bailham said this:

�In my opinion I
feel that the mother does have the ability to implement change but because she
is egocentric and immature in her thinking she solely focuses on her need to
stay in a risky relationship. The mother�s needs are so great to maintain the
relationships that she is unable and unwilling to recognise risks to her
children��.She needs to make significant changes to enable her safely to parent
her children but I do not feel at present she has sufficient insight to make
these changes within the children�s timescales�

18    The conclusions
expressed by Dr Bailham concerning the mother�s perceived difficulties in
resuming the care of her children prompted an application to the court by the
local authority on 10th October 2013 for supervision orders in
relation to all five children while they remained in separate placements with
the maternal grandparents. The interim threshold document dated 9th
October 2013 set out the concerns of the local authority following receipt of
the report of Dr Bailham and a negative parenting assessment of the mother
dated 24th September 2013 which had concluded that the mother was
not a suitable long term carer for any of her children.� 

19    A parenting
assessment of the mother was carried out by the social worker for the children
and was dated 24th September 2013. In that assessment, the social
worker commented on the mother describing herself as a good mother who was able
to take good care of the children and who was being punished for �one mistake�.
The mother had also told the social worker that she did not want to be in a
relationship and had decided to focus on her children and become a better
mother to them. 

20    In her
assessment, the social worker stated that the mother lacked insight into how
her impulsive actions have impacted on her childrens� emotional, psychological
and physical wellbeing. Throughout the parenting capacity domains there had
been significant issues which had impacted on the mother�s ability to parent
the children which included:

�        
Chaotic lifestyle

�        
Lack of safety awareness

�        
The Mother�s inability to prioritise her childrens� needs above
her own

�        
Domestic violence

�        
Low self-esteem

�        
Failure to create change and work in a transparent manner with
the Local Authority.

� In the
social worker�s opinion, these issues had compromised the emotional stability
and safety of the children and had also caused them significant harm. �Although
the mother �had voiced that she will change in her approach in order to provide
a better standard of care to her children, her actions highlight that the
Mother does not implement what she says into practice in order to bring about
change�. The assessment concluded with the social worker expressing the
professional opinion that the mother was not capable of meeting her �children�s
holistic needs and create change within the children�s timescales�.

 

21    The guardian
prepared� a report for a hearing on 25th October 2013. She noted the
conclusions of Dr Bailham�s report and the parenting assessment and the
concerns about the mother�s capacity to change sufficiently within the children�s
time scales for her to be able to provide them with appropriate safeguarding
and care. In particular, the parenting assessment, prepared in September 2013, had
highlighted the mother�s perception of herself as a good parent. The mother had
told the guardian that she was in receipt of advice from Womens� Aid in respect
of domestic violence and the impact of this on her past parenting. At the time
that the guardian prepared her report, the maternal grandmother acknowledged to
the guardian, with much regret, that she could not meet the long term needs of D
and E.� She acknowledged the struggle she was having in coping with the
situation, practically, physically and emotionally and she clearly felt very
conflicting loyalties about the situation. The Guardian noted that the
responsibility for the care of her grandchildren had been imposed on the
maternal grandmother and had not been assumed by choice but that, as the
children�s grandmother, she could not agree to the placement of D and E in
foster care.

22    �The guardian
supported a reduction in contact to the mother (at that time) from every day to
twice a week for the older children and twice a week for the younger children
after school.� She also highlighted the need for inter-sibling contact.

23    At a hearing on
25th October 2013, and in circumstances where D and E could no
longer remain in the care of the maternal grandmother, the local authority were
left with the only option of placing the children together in long term foster
care. ��On 31st October 2013, by direction of the court all five
children were made subject to interim care orders with the three elder children
remaining in the care of the maternal grandfather and his partner.

24    F was born on at
beginning of November 2013. On 12th November 2013 and prior to her
discharge from hospital, the local authority applied for an interim care order.
The application referred to the mother�s initial denial that she had been in a
relationship with F�s father despite social care having been advised by
probation that he was released from prison to her address. F�s father was found
to have 14 aliases on his PNC and there was reference to him being an over stayer
in the UK for immigration purposes. There was also reference in the application
to an allegation made against F�s father that he had raped a 16 year old girl (although
he was never prosecuted for this offence) and earlier investigations in
relation to possible exposure to two boys. On 13th November 2013, F
was made the subject of an interim care order and placed in foster care.� Since
F�s placement in foster care the mother has had twice weekly supervised contact
to F for one hour at the Oaktree Resource Centre in Grays. There are positive
reports relating to the mother�s interaction with F. F�s father sees F for one
hour of supervised contact each week at the same venue. 

25    In her first
statement to the court, the mother said that she had been attending Womens Aid
since 4th October 2013 and was due to start the WISP Programme in
February 2014. �She was also engaged in a Domestic Violence Group and had
undertaken work with Coram in relation to parenting and domestic violence.� In
her response to threshold, she agreed that B and E�s father had hit her once
during the early months of her relationship when she was pregnant with B but
only on one occasion. She agreed that when D was about 6 months old. In early
2008 her relationship with the father of C and D had ended and that she had then
resumed her relationship with B and E�s father. She said that all had been well
until after E� birth in April 2009 when the domestic violence became worse .She
agreed that on occasions he had hit the children and said that she had intervened
to protect them.� Her relationship with F�s father had started around June/July
2012. 

26    In his statement
dated 2nd December 2013, F�s father said that he had been born in
Sierra Leone and had lived in the UK for approximately 9 years. He had been
granted temporary admission to remain in the UK. He said that he had an older
child who lived in Freetown, Sierra Leone with his mother. He said that he had
separated from the mother in late June or early July 2013. He disputed that he
had used aliases, that he had ever been charged with rape or that he had served
a prison sentence in 2013 following which he had been discharged to the
mother�s home. He agreed, however, that on 30th July 2013 he had
received a community order with 12 months supervision for possession of
documents with intern and dishonestly making a false representation. 

27    In his final
statement to the court the current allocated social worker for the five oldest
children, who has held this role since 11th December 2013, sought
final care orders for all five children on the basis that the mother was
�unlikely to be able to achieve the imperative improvements in her care and the
sustainability thereof within the children�s timescales�. He noted that the
mother had engaged well with the Domestic Violence Awareness course and had
learnt (for the first time) that sexual abuse and rape was possible within a
relationship. She had also engaged with Womens� Aid. Women�s Aid had advised social
services that while the mother did not put her children deliberately at risk
she had no understanding of the risks which her children faced.� However, the
mother had showed good commitment to the course. 

28    In January 2014
the mother started an 8 week programme focussing on the effects of children
witnessing domestic violence. She had engaged with SERICC between September 2013
and November 2013 in order to understand the effects of sexual abuse on
children. The mother advised social services that she had come a long way and
had now developed an understanding of the children�s needs and how to keep her
children safe. 

29    In his
statement, the older children�s social worker gave a snapshot of the five older
children:

a.       A
�his behaviour had greatly improved since being in care. At his new school
there has been a massive improvement in his behaviour and development. He
enjoyed the structure and safety of living with his grandfather. He appeared to
feel guilty about previous behaviour and wanted to learn to manage his anger.

b.      B
�she had settled well in the placement with her grandfather and has said that
since being in care she was not scared anymore. She came across as a self
confident and happy girl.� She wanted no contact to her father and said that she
was scared of him. She wanted to see her mother and F.

c.       C
�he was described as a quiet boy and more introvert than his siblings. He spoke
openly about the nightmares he had nearly every night and felt that these were
triggered by the movies he watched when he was living with his mother. He was
progressing well at school. He was �happy with life as it is�. He liked seeing
his mother for contact. 

d.      D
�she was described (along with E) as more boisterous than the older siblings.
She and E had broken all the �breakable� presents which they had received at
Christmas. She was described as challenging at school. She presented sometimes
as a little �diva� with pretentious behaviour. She said that she wanted to live
in a house with five flats with one flat for each of her siblings. She wasn�t
sure if she wanted her mother to live in the house. She said, categorically,
that she did not have a father. 

e.       E
�he was described as a lovely little boy who engaged well in games and
responded well to one-to-one attention, He had taken a while to settle in the
foster placement. He did not express any wishes and feelings. 

30    An assessment of
risk and contact in respect of F�s father was undertaken by the allocated
social worker and filed at court on 23rd December 2013. The report
raised concerns about F�s father�s basic parenting skills, uncertainty about
his background history and physical abuse by him towards the mother�s older
children while he lived with her.

31    In her third and
final statement, the mother annexed documents in support of the work, which she
had done to improve her parenting skills. Women�s Aid stated that there had
been a �great improvement in the mother�s awareness of domestic abuse and the
effect on herself and her children while she has been attending our sessions�.
SERICC commented that before giving birth to F it had been her professional
opinion that the mother�s understanding and insight into the safeguarding of
her children was not at a level that would ensure their safeguarding �and that
there would need to be more ongoing long term work undertaken with the mother
to enable this to happen�. Since November 2013, however, the mother had, in the
opinion of her SERICC worker, moved forward in her ability to make the links
and to identify the concerns of the professionals. She was now able to admit
that she did not safeguard her children previously and was �very much aware�
that she placed not only herself but also her children at risk of harm. 

32    In a short
letter to the court dated 28th February 2014, the maternal
grandfather said that he fully accepted and agreed with the actions of the
local authority when they had stepped in to remove his grandchildren from his
daughter�s care. He felt that the work, which the mother had done with the
support agencies had brought about a change in her attitude to the children and
her engagement with them. During contact she was now calm with the children
whereas, previously, if one of the children misbehaved, her first instinct had
been to slap them on the arm. 

33    The guardian prepared
a final analysis for the final hearing dated 11th March 2014. She
commented on the various pieces of work, which the mother had done to address
her parenting of the children.� On 7th March 2014 she had spoken to
the SERICC worker who had worked with B and D and was currently working with
the mother. She had �commended the mother for the changes which she had made
since December 2013, but was clear that the shift in the mother�s engagement
and understanding had only occurred following a session prior to Christmas when
she had broken down for the first time and had recognised that her children had
been exposed to harm. The mother had then expressed real feelings of guilt. The
SERICC worker felt that since this time, the mother had engaged with the
programme in a meaningful way, her demeanour had changed and the barrier of
anger had dissipated. 

34    In acknowledging
the positive nature of the various interventions undertaken by the mother to
improve her parenting and the change in the mother�s general attitude, the
Guardian commented on the need for the court to assess �whether her timescales
for demonstrating essential sustained changes (in both her understanding and
her functioning) are compatible with the timescales of her three younger
children�.

35    In a discussion
with the guardian prior to the preparation of her report, the mother had been
candid in her past admissions of other inadequacies in her parenting. She had described
the home as chaotic (and had described her previous property as a �shit hole�)
and said that she had been unable to manage her finances. She also described
leaving the children to their own devices, not supporting them in their schoolwork
and screaming and shouting at them when they were challenging. On a visit to
the mother�s home, the Guardian described holes in one of the bedroom doors
(caused by A when he had been angry) and noted that the front and back garden were
in a very messy condition. 

36    The Guardian commented
on the mother�s patient handling of F during contact. The older children tried
to gain their mother�s attention and were involved in brief disagreements with
each other during contact. In the opinion of the Guardian (who was present
during the contact visit), the mother did not seem to be aware of the
individual reactions and responses of her children but interacted with them as
a group. In her opinion, this highlighted the difficulties which the mother
would have in ensuring appropriate boundaries in place for each of the
children,

37    The Guardian
described D as quite a precocious and attention seeking little girl who could
be stubborn and confrontational. She was described by her foster carer as
having no respect for women and little regard for anyone else. The guardian had
been advised of a recent incident when D had kept swinging around one of the
poles on the underground train at a time when a disabled man had needed to hold
the pole to secure himself. D had taken no notice of him and had ignored her
carer�s request to stop.� At the next station the carer had to remove D from
the train to stop her. �However her behaviour had continued on the next train
and on subsequent ones leading to five changes of train before she had finally
responded appropriately. 

38    At school there
had been concerns about D�s lack of respect for her teacher. She was not
reaching her potential academically. Her behaviour had deteriorated in the
weeks preceding the LAC Review at the beginning of February 2014.

39    E had been
described by his maternal grandmother as being a particularly challenging and
demanding little boy when he had lived with her (April �October 2013) and he
had been described to the guardian by his grandfather -more recently- as a very
angry child. However, he was not considered particularly difficult or
challenging within the foster placement. He was significantly overweight
wearing clothes for a 7-8 year old when he was not yet 5 years old.� At school
he was described as being ready to learn, well motivated and gaining in
confidence.

40    In the
guardian�s opinion, the benefit of the three youngest children being reunited
with their mother would mean that all six children could grow up within their
family, maintaining important relationships in a flexible manner, which would
promote their respective sense of identity. However, D and E had suffered harm
from their past experiences with their mother. As the guardian pointed out, the
children were �exposed to domestic violence through their mother�s
relationships, their needs were neglected, there were inadequate boundaries and
poor supervision; D was sexually abused; there are indications that
inappropriate physical punishments were used; E became obese. Both now exhibit
challenging behaviours because of their respective insecurities and attachment
difficulties��..I would be concerned that without the successful completion of
the work in which the mother has only very recently been engaging in a
meaningful way and with her also undertaking the recommended psychotherapy,
reunification would again place these children at an unacceptable level of
risk.�

41    In relation to F,
the guardian commented that whilst F would not pose the same behavioural
challenges, the other identified risks with regard to D and E could be considered
equally applicable to her. Additionally, reunification with her mother would
significantly increase the risk of communication and contact between F�s father
and the mother and the potential for their relationship to be resumed. 

42    At paragraph 33
of her final analysis the Guardian said this: �the benefits of long-term foster
care for D and E (for whom there is no family alternative if reunification to
their mother is not possible) would include the maintenance of direct established
family relationships �which are important for their respective identity needs. They
would be reassured of their mother�s and grandparents� love for them through
their commitment to contact. They would be provided with different parental
role models and protected from harm. The negative factors, as for their older
siblings, include the continued involvement of the Children�s Services with the
associated restrictions and feelings of being different from their friends;
some risks of placement breakdown and the potential for being moved around in
care�Whilst adoption would provide more legal security, the firmly established
extended family relationships would make it difficult for these two children to
cope with permanent severance, particularly when they know their older siblings
are being maintained within the family�

43    The Guardian
felt that having particular regard to D and E� behaviour issues and challenges
and their associated need for insightful and sensitive care if these were to be
addressed and overcome, it was her opinion that the mother�s �remaining
vulnerabilities and identified areas of difficulty are such that at this time
she would not be able to provide appropriate and safe care to meet their
specific needs. Their timescale for clarity about their future and permanence
is such that decisions need to be made now for these to be secured. In all the
circumstances I believe that the only appropriate order for the Court�s
consideration is a care order and I endorse the care plan for them to be placed
together in a long term foster placement�. �

44    In his oral
evidence to the court, the current social worker for all the children except F,
indicated that if the court approved the care plan for long term fostering of D
and E, they would take steps to find a new placement within the next 2 months
as the current placement was not entirely satisfactory and a new placement
would be likely to bring about significant improvements in the children�s
behaviour. He said that while the mother should be commended for her recent progress,
the main concern of the local authority was her ability (or otherwise) to keep
the children safe from abusive relationships with men and in his opinion, there
was �more for the mother to do� in terms of meeting the children�s emotional needs
before she was in a position to offer them �good enough� parenting.� 

45    Although the
contact notes showed that there were positive features in the mother�s
relationship with the children, this was very different from a capacity to look
after the children on a 24/7 basis. In his opinion, the ongoing progress of the
mother could not be achieved with the timescale of the children and the
proceedings. �While the children enjoyed contact with their mother, they did
not wish to return to live with her and the risks associated with the
children�s return home were too great not only in relation to safeguarding
issues but also in relation to the mother�s ability to meet the needs of her
children. E� behaviour, in particular, had improved markedly since his reception
into care, but the underlying issues of why he had behaved as he had while in
the care of his mother remained unresolved. Before and after contact, E�
behaviour could be very destructive.

46    He saw no
benefit in obtaining an addendum assessment from Dr Bailham in relation to the
mother�s capacity to care for D and E and considered that the children needed
certainty now. Any work with the mother could only start after there had been a
more positive assessment of the mother and identifiable improvements in her
parenting capacity, which, in his opinion, would not be in the children�s
timescales. He considered that if D and E remained in foster care, contact to
the mother should be limited to once a month as more frequent contact would jeopardise
the stability of the placement.

47    �In advance of
giving oral evidence at the final hearing, Dr Bailham had read all the updating
material �including the guardian�s final analysis �which had been completed
following Dr Bailham�s assessment of the mother in August 2013. In her oral
evidence, Dr Bailham commented that although the mother�s insight and awareness
as to her past parenting had increased in relation to the sexual abuse of B and
D, she had not, in other respects made the changes in her understanding of past
deficits which Dr Bailham would have hoped for. 

48    In her opinion,
although the mother might now understand the impact of sexual abuse, she had
not been horrified, remorseful or shown any real emotion when she had seen her.
Until very recently she had blamed external factors for her children�s plight.
Although her awareness had developed, she had not shown as much emotion or
shame as would have been expected given the children�s history. Equally, her
insight into the impact of domestic violence was not as much as would have been
expected. Dr Bailham had not been convinced at her meeting with the mother in
August 2013 that the relationship with F�s father had ended despite the
mother�s efforts to persuade her that this was the case. In her opinion, given
the mother�s history of relationships, it was highly likely that she would find
herself in another �risky relationship� or would go back to F�s father. The
mother had a juvenile and immature approach to relationships with men (akin to
the way an adolescent girl perceived a relationship) and she was not wary of
men nor did she think through the consequences for herself and her children in
engaging in intimate relationships with men. 

49    Dr Bailham felt
that a major concern at interview was the mother�s lack of emotion and she felt
that it would take years for the mother to come to terms with the past and be
able to make real changes in her outlook on life. Ideally she would need
psychotherapy for up to 4 months and then a period afterwards to see if any
change had occurred. It had only been in December 2013 (after F�s birth) that
there had been an indication of the mother�s understanding of her situation at
a deeper level. However, in Dr Bailham�s words the mother had �only started on
the journey�. �In her opinion, F could not safely be placed in her care and
certainly not at a time when she was undergoing psychotherapy.� She would need
psychotherapy without the distraction of a child and then an assessment without
a child being in her home. There had been very poor parenting in the past with
risk factors, which would need an extended period of assessment to determine
whether any substantive changes had been made. 

50    Dr Bailham felt
that the mother would struggle having D and E in her care, as these two children
were emotionally damaged by what they had seen at home while in their mother�s
care. In her professional opinion, a further assessment of the mother was not
required because much more time was needed to assess whether the mother could
make significant changes in her parenting to enable her to care safely for any
of her children. An assessment carried out in the next two months would not
enable Dr Bailham (from a professional perspective) to be in a better position
to advise the court on a subsequent occasion. 

51    Dr Bailham felt
that the mother had misinformed her at the interview about her ongoing
relationship with F�s father and she commented that bearing in mind the abuse
of B and D, she wondered why she had continued in a relationship with a man she
knew very little about. It was, in her opinion, very worrying that the mother
had told the guardian that the risks associated with F�s father were
exaggerated. �In August 2013, the mother had referred to the children being
�supposedly� sexually abused and had appeared to have an emotional
disconnection from her children. Although she had started to show some insight
following her attendance at various programmes, the progress had been
�incredibly slow� and there was not enough evidence to show that this could be
maintained over time. 

52    Although Dr Bailham
said in cross-examination that she would be happy to re-assess the mother, her
principal concern was the amount of time that it had taken the mother to reach
the level of insight, which she had now about her inadequate past care of her
children. There was a repeating pattern of the mother choosing to have
relationships with abusive men, which had disastrous consequences. She queried,
in this context, how the mother could change her ways and moderate her
impulsive relationship choices. The mother did not understand about domestic
violence until she started the programmes and her low self-esteem was likely to
continue to put her in very risky situations. Dr Bailham said that the mother
was very literal in her thinking and that although she took concepts on board,
it was �questionable whether she could integrate this into her own thinking and
put it into practice�.� 

53    She said that
she could assess the mother now, but any changes would only occur later and the
mother�s very late insight into how the children had been treated �when they
had been in her care called into question whether she had the ability to go
back to the job of parenting again.� She had started the journey, but had a
long way to go and needed a lot of therapy to change. In August 2013 she had
showed no empathy towards the children and had not seen the situation from
their perspective at all. She had now shown some changes in this regard but
late in the day. 

54    In Dr Bailham�s professional
opinion, there was no need for any further assessment of the mother. �If any
assessment was ordered by the court this would be better focussed on the
mother�s ability to care for F only as the prospect of her caring for all three
children would be a real challenge for the mother. The mother would struggle
greatly with the parenting of D and E who had specific behavioural
difficulties. Dr Bailham said that psychotherapy was essential for the mother
to address her historic problems and that it was not enough for her to reflect
on her relationship patterns and show insight in this regard; she needed
psychotherapy in order to understand and address the need for her to change as
a parent. There was a lot of work to be done.

55    The author of
the parenting assessment said in evidence that while the mother now had some
awareness of domestic violence, which would hopefully aid her decision making
process, the concerns about her overall parenting capacity were still viable.
The children needed a parent who was able to meet their needs and it was clear
from their behaviour now just how much their previous care from their mother
had impacted on their development. 

56    At contact the
mother had struggled to focus on the individual needs of the children and given
the behavioural problems of D and E, there were real concerns about how the
mother could care for them without boundaries, which she was unlikely or unable
to put in place. There was no real evidence that the mother was moving on and
she still believed that F�s father had had a positive parental role in the children�s
life even though B had expressed a negative view of F�s father.� In her
opinion, changes in the mother had been initiated but not completed. When she
had been the social worker for the children, the mother had attended CORAM but
had been unable to put the advice, which she had received into practice and it
had been only after F�s birth that she had acknowledged the need for change.�
She had not been proactive earlier in addressing her problems. 

57    In her oral
evidence F�s social worker stated that if the aunt�s further assessment was not
positive, she would maintain her recommendation that it was in F�s best
interests to be placed for adoption. Having heard from Dr Bailham she could not
see how a further assessment could be of any value. The mother needed
psychotherapy, which would take time. F was a young baby who needed permanency
and stability in her life. At the moment, although the mother had engaged with
professionals, there was no evidence that the work she had undertaken was
sufficient for F to be returned to her care. F could not wait for her mother to
change. She said in cross-examination that if a child was at risk in a parent�s
home, it did not matter whether the issue was one of insight or failure to
protect and that the critical issue was about a child�s overall safety when
living with a parent. Dr Bailham had recommended psychotherapy for the mother,
which was not a short piece of work and had not started yet. F could not be
safely placed with her mother while she was undergoing psychotherapy. There was
therefore, in her opinion, no benefit to be derived from any further assessment
of the mother at this juncture.

58    The mother told
the court in evidence that she had attended Coram, Women�s Aid, SERICC and WISP
to enhance her insight into giving the children a better life. She accepted
that she had not had insight previously. She had found that the courses had
been very helpful. She said that when the children had been with her, things
were not as they should have been and that she had low self-esteem, which she
had now been able to build up. She now realised that her children�s needs were
greater than her own. Previously there had been no real boundaries in the home
but she could now put these in place. 

59    She said that
although F�s father had seemed a nice person at first she had subsequently
realised that he had criminal offences and she had not wanted to continue a relationship
with him. She now understood the sort of person that he was and would now be
able to make a decision about him based on his �actions, body gestures and
verbals�. She still considered, however, that he had been good with the
children. She had not seen any frightening behaviour on his part towards any of
the children and the description of his behaviour towards F during contact (as
recorded by the guardian in her final analysis) was behaviour she had never
seen before. �She had never met any members of F�s father�s family.

60    In the future,
if she met someone she would set a test and see what they were like; if there
were �red flags� she would finish the relationship.� She said that D and E
could be challenging but that now she could deal with this and she knew that
she could manage to care for the three youngest children. She was no longer as
stressed as she used to be. She said that D had never behaved towards her as
the guardian had described in her report (when the foster carers had taken her
on the London underground) and that, in her opinion, there had been no need for
the foster parents to change tube five times as a result of D�s behaviour. She
considered that any behavioural problems with the children were because they
were now in care and did not stem from the parenting, which they had received
from her.� 

61    The mother
agreed that she needed to undertake psychotherapy and she was willing to do
anything if it meant that the children would return home. She said, however,
that it was not necessary for her to do the work before the children came home
and that with a bit of support, she could look after all three children and they
would be safe. She said that she could deal with any challenges, which were
presented to her. 

62    In her oral
evidence the guardian said that the mother had demonstrated a clear willingness
to want to change but she was concerned that she had �struggled quite
considerably with the understanding of concepts which had been discussed with
her and her ability to internalise those concepts�. She had been a parent for
12 years and there had been entrenched difficulties over a long period of time,
which could not be rectified without a lot of support. The mother needed to
understand how and why changes needed to be made and to be empathetic towards
the children�s needs. �D and E had both demonstrated challenging behaviour and
as they had not been diagnosed with any particular difficulties, their
behaviour had to be attributed to their experiences and care to date. 

63    Having regard to
the oral evidence of Dr Bailham, the guardian saw no benefit or necessity for a
further assessment to be carried out within the next 8 weeks. She said that
although the mother had taken the words of the professionals on board, there
was some doubt about how much she had understood. Although the mother could
recognise that the professionals had serious concerns, she could not see the
concerns. She continued to struggle with the concept of F�s father posing any
risk to F when he had been a good father figure to the older children.� She
could not link the past experiences of her children (and particularly D and E)
to their present behaviour in foster care. The mother was, in the guardian�s
opinion, quite naive to suggest that because she had attended a few sessions of
Coram she had now sufficient parenting skills to deal with the �concerning
behaviour� exhibited by D and E. 

64    In relation to
future contact between the mother and D and E if they remained in foster care,
the guardian considered that monthly contact was appropriate with contact reducing
initially to fortnightly and then moving to monthly. She said that there had to
be a distinction made between the three older children staying in the family
(and seeing the mother fortnightly) and the situation if D and E were placed in
long term foster care. It was important for D and E to have a proper sense of
belonging to a long term foster family. The purpose of contact to the mother
was to retain their identity not to enhance their relationship with their
mother with a view to reunification. There should also be three weekly contact
between the siblings.

65    Conclusion: I
have referred to the evidence at some length in this judgment because I am
acutely conscious of the mother�s wish to care for D, E and F and her genuine
belief that having engaged on various programmes since the children were
removed from her care, she is now able to care competently for them within her
home. I start from the premise that if at all possible children should be
brought up within their birth family rather than cared for within a foster
placement outside the family. My decision in this case requires particular
analysis because in this large sibling group, the three oldest children are to
remain within the extended birth family living in the home of the maternal
grandfather. My starting point in this judgment is therefore to recognise the
benefits for all the children remaining within the family if at all possible
and to consider, very carefully, whether this mother has made changes in her
parenting which would enable the court to be confident either now or in the
foreseeable future, that the three youngest children could be safely returned
to her care. 

66    An arrangement whereby
the six children remained within the family would �of course lead to far greater
flexibility in the interrelationships between the siblings and, as the guardian
pointed out, would enhance their individual sense of identity in knowing that
they belonged within the same family group and were treated equally and fairly.
I am only too well aware that a long-term foster placement brings with it a
degree of uncertainty and a potential lack of stability particularly as
children in a foster placement grow older and realise that the arrangements
within the foster home do not mirror the arrangements of their friends who are
not engaged with the care system. I also recognise that there is always stigma,
from a child�s perspective associated with being �a child in care.�

67    That said and
while long term foster care is not an ideal placement for children, it is an
arrangement whereby children who cannot live with their parents are cared for
by individuals committed to care for them in a safe and consistent manner and
where, significantly, children are not exposed to harmful situations within the
home. I am quite clear from all that I have read that all of the mother�s
children (save F) suffered significant harm while they were in her care. They
were at best neglected having been denied any stimulus or meaningful emotional
rapport from their mother and at worst were subjected to physical abuse by
various of the mother�s partners whom, in my judgment, the mother clearly
prioritised over her young dependent children. The mother appeared to move
seamlessly between unsuitable partners (reuniting and having another child with
one particularly violent individual) and, in my judgment, she had no sense of
responsibility towards the children. 

68    Her last partner
and father of F may have been a less violent individual from the mother�s
perspective but there are clear indications from more recent disclosures from B
that she was scared of him and there may have been some sexualised behaviour on
his part towards her while he was living with the mother.� Moreover, F�s father
was prepared to support the arrangement whereby the children were cared for by
totally unsuitable babysitters in early 2013 who sexually abused both D and B
while he and the mother and went out socialising on a regular basis. In my
judgment, the situation in the mother�s household in April 2013 (the date of
the referral to social services) represented a level of care given by the
mother to her (then) five children which was chaotic and damaging to the physical
and emotional welfare of these young vulnerable children. Although I fully
accept that this mother never set out to be cruel to her children and that the
harm caused to them was not deliberate, I am entirely satisfied that she had,
until fairly recently, a completely misguided confidence about the way in which
she had cared for the children which was borne out by evidence of her anger - not
remorse- in the months following the children�s removal from her care. It was
clear from Dr Bailham�s report and her evidence during the final hearing, that
in August 2013 (4 months after the children were removed) the mother could not
see anything wrong about her previous parenting of the children and she not
only lacked any empathy towards her children having no insight whatsoever into the
harm which individually and jointly they had suffered while living with her at
home. 

69    I am entirely
satisfied that this mother only woke up to the realities of the situation once
her own mother could no longer care for D and E when these children were placed
outside the family and the mother�s unrestricted contact to her children
ceased. The placement of D and E in foster care combined with the removal of F
after her birth in November 2013 were, as I find, the trigger for the mother�s
realisation that she bore primary responsibility for her children�s
circumstances and their separation from each other. I do believe that the
mother has now made some progress emotionally towards understanding why the children
were removed from her care. Nevertheless, it is, in my judgment, very early
days.

70    �I found that
when the mother gave evidence at the hearing, she adopted the professional
views of those who had been advising her on various programmes without really recognising
how she would do things differently in the future if she cared for the three youngest
children. By way of example, when the mother was asked about the disclosure
made by B that F�s father had stayed in her bedroom while she went to sleep,
the mother seemed at a loss to know how to deal with the impact of this
disclosure with her answers ranging from a dramatic �if she had told me he
would have been away� to subsequently adopting, with relief, a possible less
sinister explanation for this behaviour. 

71    I was left with
the clear impression that although the mother had been taught about warning
signs and dangers in relation to the risk of sexual abuse, she could not really
explain how she would put into practice what she had learned if one or other of
her children were or appeared to be at risk. I agree with the guardian that
while the mother took on board the language of change (and described, for
example, a changed �presentation� of herself) I was not convinced that, as yet,
she had understood the significance of having to make huge changes in her
parenting to enable the youngest children to live with her.� 

72    The mother has
undoubtedly started on a road to change and her admission in December 2013 of
previous poor parenting and her guilt about this was undoubtedly a key to
moving the work forward. However, an admission alone cannot undo all the years
of very poor parenting. Although the mother said that she would do any amount
of psychotherapy if this meant that the children could come home, her evidence
(in the face of the clearest professional evidence to the contrary) was that it
was not necessary for her to do the work before she could resume care of the
children and that she wanted the three youngest children to come home now.� As
she put it �with a bit of support, I could look after all three children and
they would be safe and I could deal with any challenges�.

73    The mother has
not, in my judgment, made sufficient changes at this stage of the proceedings
for me to have confidence that she can provide safe and consistent care for her
children. I do not consider that any further assessment of the mother by Dr
Bailham in the next few months will assist the court in making final orders for
the placement of D and E. There is a lot more work for the mother to do and she
is only at the start of a process of change. The children cannot be expected to
wait until there is an assessment, which identifies changes which are of such
significance that she is able to resume parenting these children. �I therefore
do not accede to the application that I should defer making final orders for D
and E. They have serious behavioural and developmental issues, which are, as I
find, a reflection of the very poor quality of care which this mother gave her
children. Moreover, it is of importance that the children want to see their
mother for contact but are not asking to come home to live with her. 

74    I am troubled
that despite the programmes with which the mother has engaged she cannot
understand how the troubled behaviour of D and E (breaking all their breakable
Christmas presents and D�s behaviour on the underground while in the care of
the foster mother) is a reflection of how she treated them. The mother wants to
forget about the past and start again with a clean slate but I�m afraid her
inability to grasp the impact of her very poor parenting on her children and
her belief that all will be well once they come home, shows the limitations of
her insight into what went wrong during the 12 years of parenting her children.

75    In my judgment, it
would not be in the best interests and welfare of D and E to be returned to the
care of their mother. I have concluded, based on all the historic and updated
evidence, that the mother does not currently have the capacity to parent these
children to a �good enough� standard�. At the present time, there are no
identifiable changes which would enable me to conclude that it would be safe
for the children to return home and I am not prepared to take chances with
their future development and welfare when they have already been exposed in
their short lives to a harmful environment while living with their mother. �

76    �I have
concluded, in accordance with a careful consideration of the welfare check list
in s1 of the Children Act 1989 that in circumstances where (as I find) the
mother does not have the capacity to care for D and E for the foreseeable
future, the only option is for them to be placed in long-term foster care.
These children need finality and having given detailed reasons for the mother�s
inability to care for the children, no further delay in making plans for their
long term placement should be sanctioned by the court.

77    I have
considered carefully whether I should order any further assessment by Dr
Bailham of the mother to guide my decision making in relation to the long term
placement of F. I am satisfied, having heard the evidence of Dr Bailham and the
guardian that the preparation of a further assessment during the next 8 weeks and
before the matter returns to court is not necessary or required to determine
the placement options for F. Having concluded that the mother has not made
sufficient changes at this time for me to be confident that she could look
after her older children safely, I consider that it would be a misguided
approach for me to offer the mother hope that as a result of a further
assessment by an expert (an expert who, herself, does not think that a further
assessment of the mother will be of assistance) the court might nevertheless order
at a further hearing in May 2014 that F should be placed in the care of the
mother. In my judgment, no further assessment of the mother is required. My
criticism of her parenting of the older children are, at the present time,
entirely valid in relation to the mother�s capacity to parent F.� F is a young
dependent child who needs constant vigilance, nurturing and committed care and
I am satisfied that the mother is currently not able to meet her needs without
exposing her child to the risk of harm. I therefore decline to order a
supplementary assessment of the mother by Dr Bailham.

78    For the reasons
given above, I make final care orders in relation to D and E as requested by
the local authority. I approve the care plans for those children particularly
in relation to ongoing contact between the mother and the children. I entirely
accept the plan for frequent inter-sibling contact as advanced by the guardian.


79    Even though I
have commented specifically on the mother�s situation in relation to her future
care of F, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to make a
final care order today in relation to F. There will be various placement
avenues to explore at the hearing in May 2014 and in my judgment no final order
should be made without all relevant parties (including F�s father) being able
to make appropriate representations to me at court.

JUDGMENT


THE JUDGE:  I am concerned today with A, who was born on 15th�January 2014.  His mother is B.  His father is believed to be C.  

 
The Local Authority's key social worker is D and A's Cafcass guardian is E.

 
There are two applications before the court: the Local Authority's application for a care order dated 30th�January 2014 and, as their plan is that A be placed for adoption, an accompanying placement order application dated 28th�March 2014.

 
Neither of the parents are present in court.  The mother, I am pleased to say, has proved cooperative with Ms F who represents her and has attended appointments. I hope I can understand why she has not been able to bring herself to come to court.   Her position is that she would very much like to care for A herself, but recognises that the court is unlikely to view that as a realistic option and does not actively oppose these applications.

 
C does not have parental responsibility.  He has, nevertheless, been given notice of these proceedings.  He has played no part within them and has declined to speak to social workers.

 
This is a tragic situation.  A is the mother's seventh child.  The names of her other children are G, H, J, K, L and M, all of whom have been the subject of proceedings before me.  All have been placed for adoption except L, who has been placed with a paternal aunt, N.  Given the mother's position, I would not propose to dwell upon the circumstances which have necessitated their removal from her care.  She has a long history of significant mental illness, as has the father. There have been a series of very alarming and worrying events in the lives of the older children.  

 
Thus it was, when the mother fell pregnant with A, the Local Authority conducted a pre-birth assessment, which concluded negatively. The familiar anxieties remained; the nature of the parents' relationship, mental health concerns and the mother's lack of any stable accommodation.  Following the institution of proceedings, the Local Authority has concluded a social work assessment of the mother, which is dated 27th�March 2014 and I also have the assistance of a detailed report from E, dated 31st�March 2014.

 
In contrast to the position in some of the previous sets of proceedings, the mother has done her very best to cooperate with those assessments and has attended contact on a regular basis.  That is much to her credit. Nevertheless, the conclusion of all of the professionals involved is that there is simply no basis whatsoever upon which I could consider placing A in the care of either of his parents.  The mother briefly put forward the friend with whom she is living, O, as a prospective carer for A but, sadly, that has come to nought.

 
In all of those circumstances, firstly, I am satisfied that the threshold criteria at section 31 of the Children Act are established.  I adopt the schedule of proposed findings prepared by the Local Authority which is found at A9 of the bundle with the addition to paragraph 4 that mother did not, in fact, appreciate that she was pregnant with either L or M.  

 
I am satisfied that the Local Authority's care plan for A, namely that he be adopted, is the best plan that can be achieved in all of the circumstances and I approve it.  

 
Bearing in mind the criteria set out in the welfare checklist at section 1(3) of the Children Act, I am satisfied that A's welfare requires me to make a care order.

 
In terms of the Local Authority's application for a placement order, it is trite law that I must be satisfied that any orders I make are a lawful, necessary, proportionate and reasonable response to A's sad predicament.  The granting of a placement order represents the most drastic curtailment of the right of these parents and of A under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which can only be justified by pressing concerns for his welfare.  However, in construing both the Convention and domestic law, I now have the assistance of the decision of the Supreme Court in Re B (A Child) [2013] UKSC 33 followed by the decisions of the Court of Appeal in Re P [2013] EWCA 963 and Re G [2013] EWCA 965.  Those cases firmly reemphasise that a placement for adoption is a "very extreme thing" and "a last resort to be approved only when nothing else will do".  Both domestic and Convention law do require a high degree of justification before adoption can be endorsed as "necessary", the term in the Convention or "required", the term in the Adoption and Children Act.

 
I am grateful to both D and E, who have analysed the various competing options for A's future, weighing the pros and cons in their respective reports to the court.  Essentially, I adopt their reasoning.  

 
Having reminded myself of the principles in the authorities I have set out, I have come to the inevitable conclusion that there really is "nothing else that will do" for A. There is sadly, no sensible alternative available to the court. A is still only just over 3 months old.  Realistically, he cannot at any stage during his minority return to the care of either of his parents.  He needs and deserves a stable, secure and permanent family of his own.  In those circumstances and applying the welfare checklist at section 1(4) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, I am satisfied that the making of a placement order is the only realistic course open to this court which accords with A's welfare throughout his life.  

 
Indeed, the position really is so clear that A's welfare requires me to dispense with the consent of his mother to the making of a placement order insofar as she is actually opposing the application.

 
I make a placement order.  

 
I approve the Local Authority's care plans in terms of the reduction in contact. I am aware that M's adopters are being assessed as prospective adopters also for A.  If that assessment is successful, as I anticipate it will be, A will be matched and placed within the next six weeks or so.  I do hope that the mother may be given the opportunity to participate in life story work, to meet the prospective adopters and to play such part as she can in her child's future in terms of indirect contact.  

 
I note that the mother has been receiving counselling and, again, I view that as a very positive step forward. Given the tragedy which the repeated removal of her children represents for her, I sincerely hope that she can be referred to some appropriate supportive organisation to help her to address the issues which will inevitably arise.  

 
I will direct a transcript of this short and inadequate judgment.  I hope that if A should at any stage in later life enquire into the circumstances in which he came to be adopted, he will appreciate that his parents' difficulties were not of their own making and that, certainly, his mother loved him very much.  I quote from the report of the guardian:

 
"There is no doubt [B] loves [A] and that she has consistently attended contact with him.  She is very affectionate towards him."
The report also records her cooperation, painful as it must be, with life story work. I know how desperately the mother would have wished to care for A and it is extremely sad that her own personal difficulties make that impossible.  
I give leave for the disclosure of any relevant documentation in these proceedings to any prospective adopters. I will reserve the adoption application to myself unless, geographically, that is impracticable for prospective adopters.  

 
I  make all the usual orders as to the assessment of costs

 
D, thank you for your efforts.  It is to the great credit of the Local Authority that we have managed to reach this position when A is still only 3 months of age. The best possible alternative for his future, that he be placed with prospective adopters is likely to be all the more successful the sooner he is placed.  E, I am also grateful to you for your reports.  I appreciate that everybody has "jumped through hoops" in this case.    

 
Ms F, I know that nothing much I can say will help the mother but I do feel for her.  I am sorry that, once again, she has not felt able to come to court but no doubt you will convey to her my best wishes and my hopes for a better future.

1.                             
Her Honour Judge Hudson :� These proceedings concern two very young boys; they
are twin brothers, A and B. They were born on the 2nd October 2013 so they are now just 4 months of age. 

 

2.                             
Their parents are M (aged 30, born
on the 22nd February 1983) and F (born on 29th October
1970 and therefore 43 years old). He has parental responsibility for the
children as he is named as their father on their respective birth certificates.


 

3.                             
The application was made on 3rd
October 2013, the day after the children�s birth, in circumstances in which the
local authority had significant concerns about the parents� ability to provide
for the children.� They have been subject to interim care orders since the 7th October 2013 and have been placed in local authority care. The proceedings
were case managed by Her Honour Judge Moir with directions given on three
separate occasions (18th October, 11th November and the
18th November 2013) before the case came before me on the first
occasion last week, the 3rd February 2014, when the case was listed
for an issues resolution hearing.� 

 

4.                             
In circumstances which I will set
out in brief shortly, the case was unable to
proceed to an effective issues resolution hearing. I adjourned the case for a
period of a week to a hearing today, 12th February 2014, when I listed
the case for an adjourned issues resolution hearing but I made it clear I intended
to use the hearing as a final hearing unless there were good reasons to do
otherwise. 

 

5.                             
The proceedings have an unhappy
background in relation to each of the boys� parents, who both have a long
history of substance misuse. They have associated offending histories. Their
relationship is one which has been said to involve domestic abuse. As a result
on 22nd August 2013, and therefore before the boys were born, the local
authority convened a child protection conference. 

 

6.                             
The local authority had, by that
stage, undertaken a pre-birth parenting assessment.
The assessment is documented in a detailed report which was completed on 31st
July 2013. The local authority considered there to be significant risks to the unborn
children as a result of the parents� circumstances. The unborn babies were each
made the subject of child protection plans under the category of neglect. Following
their birth, the children were immediately made the subject of these
proceedings.� 

 

7.                             
Very sadly, following their birth
both children needed treatment for drug withdrawal. They were discharged to
foster care on 8th October 2013 when they were six days old and that
is where they have remained. The case management directions made by Her Honour
Judge Moir included an updated parenting assessment in respect of M, who wished
to be considered as a carer for the boys.� 

 

8.                             
In the event, over the subsequent months,
each of the parents spent periods in custody. F was most recently released from
custody at the end of October 2013. M spent a further period on remand in
November 2013, I understand in relation to an offence of affray which took
place at The Probation Service, and was then released from custody at the end
of November 2013. 

 

9.                             
The relationship between the
parents has been characterised by separation and reconciliation. The local
authority was informed that they had reconciled at the end of December 2013. Within
a short space of time, however, there were accounts of domestic abuse between
them.� 

 

10.                         
The local authority arranged
contact for each of the parents with the twins. Although her attendance has
been better, M�s attendance at contact has been inconsistent. When she has
attended the contact (which has been available for her twice per week) the
contact has been generally good. So far as F is concerned, his statement filed
today recognises that he has taken up very little of the contact that has been made
available for him. He has attended only about three of the visits. I do not
question his love for his children or his wish to see them, but he has found
his own life circumstances very difficult and has not been in a position to
commit to regular contact. 

 

11.                         
By the start of this year, the
local authority was aware that each of the parents had no fixed address. They
were understood to be living between other addresses and on the streets, once
again involved in both alcohol and drug misuse. The parents have both had previous
involvement with Plummer Court in relation to their drug abuse. The report from
the Plummer Court in January 2014 indicated that they were no longer engaging.�


 

12.                         
The local authority had failed to
complete the proposed updated parenting assessment in circumstances in which M
had not engaged with the local authority and had not made herself available for
assessment. There were no alternative family carers. As a result of this, the
local authority considered the plan for the boys at a Looked After Review on 14th
January 2014 and formulated a plan for adoption.� That recommendation was
endorsed by agency decision-maker. The local authority has filed a final care
plan in respect of each of the children setting out its plan for placement for
adoption with indirect contact with the birth family. The local authority also
issued placement applications, to allow the court to determine applications in
the event final care orders are made. 

 

13.                         
The parents were each directed to
file final evidence by 24th January 2014 with a guardian�s report to
be filed by 31st January 2014. The case was then listed, initially
before Her Honour Judge Moir for an issues resolution hearing but, due to her
absence on leave at the time the case was listed, the case came before me.� 

 

14.                         
The children�s guardian, Nicola
Murphy, had completed her final analysis by that stage. She had done so without
receiving any statements from the parents but, quite properly, filed a final
analysis as directed on 31st January 2014. On the basis of the information
then available to her, she reached her conclusion that the local authority�s
plan for the boys was the appropriate way forward. She indicated her support
for that plan, having undertaken a proper analysis of the options for the
placement of the children. 

 

15.                         
The case then came before me on 3rd
February 2014.� Neither parent attended the hearing and, for reasons which
appear to be due to administrative confusion, M was not actually represented. I
was told that the parents had disengaged from the professionals. It was
understood that M was then once again in custody at Low Newton in
Northumberland.� 

 

16.                         
Following the hearing contact was
swiftly made with Mr Smith who represented M. He
has confirmed at this hearing that he had been unable to prepare a statement
because M had not engaged with him. He was, however, able to see her while she
was in custody at Low Newton and did so on the Friday of last week, the 7th
February 2014. I also invited the local authority and the children�s guardian
to do what they could to assist Mrs Sowerby (representing F) to engage him in
the proceedings before the adjourned issues resolution hearing, clearly aware (as they were) that I
intended to use this hearing as a final hearing. 

 

17.                         
The position has moved on since
then. Mr Smith duly visited M in Low Newton on Friday of last week. She told
him that she did not agree to the local authority�s plan for the children but said
that she did not want to attend court today. She asked Mr Smith to seek an
adjournment of the hearing to a final hearing at a later stage. 

 

18.                         
In the case of F, his solicitors
were able to make contact with him. I am very pleased that he has engaged with
them so they have been able to prepare a short statement which has been
provided to me today. He has attended today�s hearing, despite the delays which
I will record shortly. He has remained throughout the hearing. 

 

19.                         
F confirmed, through his
solicitors and in his statement, that the circumstances in which he presently
finds himself are not such that he could offer a home to his children (much as
he would wish to). He also recognises, and it is very much to his credit that
he does so, that the boys cannot wait for him to get his life in order so that
he could provide for them. 

 

20.                         
In the usual course, at an early
stage in the case management of the proceedings the parties were asked to put
forward any extended family members (or other carers) that they asked to be
assessed. There were two options proposed from the paternal family. One was
subject to negative assessment; the second did not proceed to a complete full
assessment because of a change of circumstances of those being assessed.� 

 

21.                         
On Thursday of last week the local
authority was notified by those representing the father that he wished to have
a further family placement considered. That was with a paternal great-aunt and
uncle, Mr and Mrs D. I am very grateful to the local authority social worker
for undertaking a very prompt initial assessment of Mr and Mrs D, which was
emailed to me yesterday and also given to Mr and Mrs D. The initial assessment
report sets out the areas of discussion with the Ds and highlights positives
and negatives in relation to their wish to provide a home for the boys, but
ultimately reached a negative conclusion.� 

 

22.                         
Mr and Mrs D were informed of the
conclusion of the assessment yesterday. They were clearly aware of the
timescale of the proceedings and today�s hearing. They were told that they
would need to attend court today if they wished any further steps to be taken
on their behalf in the proceedings. They have not attended court. Once again, I
am grateful to the social worker for the efforts that she has made this morning
to speak with Mrs D to confirm that she and her husband were aware of the time
and location of today�s hearing. Mrs D confirmed that they were disappointed with
the outcome of the assessment, but they understood why the local authority had
reached its negative conclusion. In those circumstances there are no other
placements within the family to consider. 

 

23.                         
I return to M�s case. Following
the email from Mr Smith indicating that she did not wish to attend, I replied informing
him that, if M was seeking to oppose the local authority�s plan, she was
required to attend this hearing. I made a production order to facilitate her
production from Low Newton and she was duly produced. She was present for the
early part of the hearing today, having given Mr Smith further instructions.� 

 

24.                         
Mr Smith has not been in a
position to file a statement from M. He told me that, when he visited her in
Low Newton last Friday, she was very distressed and was not in a position to
give him instructions. I therefore indicated that I was minded to proceed with
the case today and was willing to give him such time as he needed today to
clarify the instructions that he had by then outlined to
me. 

 

25.                         
M�s case was put as follows. She is
presently in Low Newton, having been arrested for a shoplifting offence which is
due before the magistrates� court later this month. I am told that M intends to
plead not guilty. Even if convicted, I am quite prepared to accept from Mr
Smith that the nature of the offence - theft of goods worth about �70 - is
unlikely to result in any form of custodial penalty. M is, however, currently
subject to a two month suspended sentence order. It is likely that that will be
activated, but the time she has already spent on remand will have provided for
that sentence to have been served. It is therefore anticipated that LM will be
released from custody by the end of this month. 

 

26.                         
Mr Smith told me on M�s instructions
- and I was quite prepared to accept from him - that on her release M is likely
to be provided with accommodation. I was told that it might be Durham area,
which would provide M with the most settled position that she has had for some
time: with accommodation out of the immediate locality and in an environment in
which it is said that she can start to rebuild her life for herself and her
children. She would ask that the children therefore remain in foster care until
she is in a position to care for the children.� 

 

27.                         
Mr Smith�s application at the
outset today was for the proceedings to be adjourned for a period of weeks so
that M would be released and then in a better position to make her application
for the final determination in respect of the boys to be postponed. I made it
clear to him that I did not see any benefit from such a course, in
circumstances in which he was well able to put those arguments and I was quite
prepared to take them at their very highest in terms of M�s release and being
rehoused as proposed. 

 

28.                         
In circumstances in which Mr Smith
had not been able to file a statement from M, I made it clear to him that I would
give him further time today to take instructions from M before she gave evidence
in support of her case (if she wished to do so). I also made it clear that I
would allow such time that was reasonably required for Mr Smith to clarify his instructions
for cross-examination of the social worker and the children�s guardian. It was
evident during that part of the hearing earlier today that M became quite
agitated - I could hear her saying that she was not prepared to stay at court
all day. I therefore rose to allow Mr Smith an opportunity to speak to her privately.


 

29.                         
I duly received a message from Mr
Smith informing me that he had clear instructions that M did not wish to come
back into court, she did not intend to participate in the hearing any further
and wanted to be able to go back to Low Newton. I made it clear that the
decision was entirely a matter for M, having received advice which I have no
doubt Mr Smith gave her in very clear terms, but that the hearing would proceed
if she chose to absent herself. 

 

30.                         
When the hearing resumed. Mr Smith
told me that he had written instructions from M that she did not intend to participate
in the hearing further. She instructed him that she did not want to stay at
court, she did not wish to oppose the application and wanted to return to Low
Newton. I clarified with Mr Smith whether he had any instructions to cross-examine
either the social worker or the children�s guardian, but he was clear that the
basis upon which he had been instructed by M left him in a position in which he
was not able to make any further representations. The local authority
applications are, therefore, unopposed but there is no consent to either of the
applications, either from M or indeed from F.� 

 

31.                         
I turn to my analysis in relation
to the threshold and welfare. There is no issue, I am pleased to say, in
relation to the threshold criteria.� The local authority filed its schedule of
findings dated 3rd October 2013 at the outset of the proceedings (at
A1-2 of the bundle). It sets out in eight paragraphs (four relating to M and
four relating to F) a short summary of the areas in which the local authority
say their circumstances and lifestyle led to the threshold criteria being
established at the time that protective measures were put in place for A and B.�


 

32.                         
Threshold concessions were made by
M at an earlier case management hearing. Ms Sowerby has confirmed the concessions
F makes (in accordance with the findings sought as they relate to him). I am
quite satisfied that those findings, which will in due course be attached to the order that I make, are a proper
and proportionate determination of the threshold in this case. The threshold is
clearly established and leads to the welfare determination in the case of A and
B. 

 

33.                         
It is clear from the history that
I have given so far that there are no family members, either the children�s
parents or within the wider family, who now are in a position to put themselves
forward as carers for the children at this stage. Any consideration of M was to
be as a future carer at some future date, once she had established herself in new
accommodation and was established to be free of drugs. Bearing in mind the very long history of drug misuse and addiction, M is yet
to satisfy the court that she could be considered as a safe and appropriate
carer for her very young children. 

 

34.                         
The welfare of the children is my
paramount consideration. In accordance with the judgment of Lord Justice McFarlane
in Re G [2013] EWCA Civ 965, where the local authority�s plan includes
the option of placement for adoption, the analysis must be undertaken in accordance
with the section 1 welfare test in the Adoption and Children Act 2002. The
court must consider the welfare of the children throughout their lives. I must have
regard to the extended welfare checklist in section 1(4) of the 2002 Act, which
requires the court to consider, amongst other factors, the impact upon the
children ceasing to be a member of the birth family upon adoption and the
impact of those orders upon the children. The court must also consider the arrangements
for contact which are proposed for the children. 

 

35.                         
I have taken account of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Re B [2013] UKSC 33, which emphasised that
a care plan of adoption is a last resort. Such a care plan can only be approved
where nothing else will do. I have also taken account of the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in Re B-S [2013] EWCA Civ 1146, in which the President stressed
the approach the court must take when undertaking the welfare analysis - a
thorough holistic evaluation of the placement options for a child particularly
before any plan for adoption can be approved. Article 8 rights are fully engaged,
so that any interference with those rights and the separation of the children through adoption
can only be justified where it is necessary and the only proportionate step
which can be undertaken. 

 

36.                         
These boys are still very young
and vulnerable. They each have particular health considerations which need to
be taken into account and which have a potential impact on their future care. So
far as A is concerned, there are concerns about his development and there is ongoing
consideration as to whether he may have cerebral palsy. So far as B is
concerned, there are fewer concerns, but he is undergoing investigation to
determine whether he has a hearing impairment. They are very young children who
are entirely dependent on others for their care needs. They clearly have family
who would wish to provide for them. The local authority�s plan for the children
will provide for their placement away from their birth family and so will
deprive A and B of the opportunity of growing up as part of their birth family.


 

37.                         
The arguments in this case are compelling.
They are set out clearly in the social work reports and the final statement of
the social worker, Rachael Speirs, together with the analysis (to which I have
already made reference) of the children�s guardian in her report of dated 31st
January 2014. 

 

38.                         
The boys simply cannot wait for
either of their parents to be in a position to provide for them. It is, as I
said, to F�s credit that he recognises that. So far as M is concerned, I have
given every consideration to the best case that she could put before the court
in terms of the care that she could offer for A and B. The period that would be
required before she could satisfy the local authority, the guardian and, most
importantly, the court that she could be reliably drug free and have a stable
lifestyle to care for the children far exceeds any timescale that could be
compatible with their needs.� 

 

39.                         
In these circumstances, there is a
pressing need for their future to be determined without any delay. Taking full
account of the section 1 welfare considerations in accordance with the 2002 Act,
I have considered the local authority�s care plan of adoption. I am quite
satisfied that the local authority�s plan is the plan that will best meet the
children�s welfare; not only throughout their childhood but providing for them
to be part of a family which can look out for them throughout their lives. It
is, in my judgment the only realistic plan. I therefore make the care orders
sought in respect of each of the children, approving the care plan of adoption
and for the children to have indirect contact with their birth families.�� 

 

40.                         
It is necessary in these
circumstances to deal with the placement applications. I gave directions for
the placement applications to be before the court today for determination in
the event that final care orders were made, approving the plan of adoption. I
have now received the report of the children�s guardian, Nicola Murphy, in
respect of the placement applications. Once again, the 2002 welfare
considerations apply - the court can only make a placement order if it will
meet the welfare interests of the children throughout their lives. The welfare
checklist at section 1(4) must be applied by the court.� 

 

41.                         
Neither M nor F (who share
parental responsibility for the twins) gives their consent to the placement
applications. In these circumstances, the court can only make placement orders
in respect of the boys if the parents� consent is dispensed with under section
52 Adoption and Children Act 2002, on the basis that the children�s welfare requires
it. 

 

42.                         
In the judgment that I have given,
I have set out a brief analysis of the circumstances which have given rise to
the proceedings and which have led to my conclusion that the local authority�s
care plan of adoption for the boys best meets their welfare interests.� 

 

43.                         
It is in the best interests of
these boys that the plans are progressed without any delay. The making of
placement orders will allow the local authority to progress the plans and
search for prospective adopters for the children without any encumbrance. I
have identified particular considerations in respect of each of the boys which may
have a bearing on their future care needs. �It is nonetheless considered both
realistic and achievable that they will be placed for adoption within a short
space of time.� 

 

44.                         
I do not propose to repeat the
matters I set out in the judgment I have given in the care proceedings. I
incorporate the reasons and conclusions given earlier for the purposes of these
applications. It is, in my judgment, essential that the boys have a future
placement which can provide for them throughout their lives. It is, in my
judgment, in their welfare interests that placement orders are made. Having
reached that conclusion, in circumstances in which their parents (quite
understandably) find themselves unable to consent to those applications, I have
reached the clear conclusion - having taken full
account, once again, of the Article 8 considerations
� that placement orders are the only orders which meet the children�s needs. Their
welfare, therefore, requires their parents� consent to be dispensed with. 

 

45.                         
I therefore dispense with the consent
of both M and F to the placement applications. In the case of both A and B, I
make a placement order. Other than that, I will make a direction for legal aid
assessment as required.� 

 

End of
judgment

We hereby certify that
this judgment has been approved by Her Honour Judge Hudson.
